{"article": ["I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our chief executive officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our chief financial officer. \u2047 Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. \u2047 We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. \u2047 We grew revenue 15% operationally, which is once again above the anticipated growth rate for the animal health market, and these results were highlighted by 27% operational growth in our companion animal portfolio with 1% operational growth in livestock. \u2047 Our parasiticide dermatology vaccines, diagnostics, and monoclonal antibody therapies all contributed to these strong results driven by the positive trends in pet care, trends that we see continuing to be a key growth driver in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 From a segment perspective, we saw solid balance across our global footprint with the U.S. up 14% and international growing 17% operationally. \u2047 Operationally, for the year, China grew 25%, Brazil grew 28% and other emerging markets grew 22%, leading the way for our international performance. \u2047 Another major growth driver for the year has been our global diagnostics portfolio, which grew 21% operationally with significant strength in international markets and the continued launch of VetScan Imagyst, our AI-driven diagnostics platform. \u2047 Based on the strong revenue performance, we were able to deliver 19% operational growth in adjusted net income for the year while investing significantly in our latest product launches as well as staffing, R&D, and manufacturing projects for future growth. \u2047 Looking ahead, we believe this momentum sets us up well for 2022. \u2047 We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in the coming year driven by continued strength in pet care, expansion of our diagnostics portfolio internationally as significant growth in both companion animal and livestock product sales for emerging markets, including China and Brazil. \u2047 As a result, we are guiding to full year operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue. \u2047 Wetteny and I will discuss more details about the full year 2022 guidance. \u2047 But let me share some views on the year and other updates. \u2047 First, the essential nature of animal health continues to be affirmed by our performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We have seen the fundamental drivers such as increased emphasis on pet wellness, a growing global population, and continuous consumption of animal-based proteins all reinforce the animal health industry as a positive investment choice. \u2047 In terms of the companion animal market, people's commitment to the health and well-being of their pets has continued to drive higher spending and new opportunities for innovation, geographic expansion, and increasing levels of care. \u2047 Pet owners spending in animal health remains one of the more durable trends in consumer spending as people place a premium on the health and wellbeing of their pets, even during challenging economic times. \u2047 In January, the Human Animal Bond Research Institute and Zoetis released the results of a new global survey of more than 16,000 pet owners and 1,200 small animal clinics which reinforce how deep the connection is between pets and pet owners and how that dynamic relates to views on veterinary care and the related benefits of pet ownership. \u2047 In the study, 92% of respondents said there was no reason they could ever be convinced to give up their pets and 86% said they would pay whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. \u2047 The strength of the human-animal bonds strongly correlated with higher rates of veterinary treatment for both preventative care and specific conditions in their pets. \u2047 This study and other research support our focus on advancing an innovative pipeline for pain, dermatology, and parasiticide for pets, and we continue to invest in our field force, direct-to-consumer marketing, and manufacturing capacity to bring these products to market. \u2047 Moving on to the livestock industry. \u2047 The need for safe and reliable sources of animal protein continues to be a fundamental growth driver for the industry, particularly in emerging markets. \u2047 In any given year, weather, disease, and market dynamics may have various regional impacts, but the underlying demand continues to be served locally or through global trade across more than 100 markets where Zoetis products are sold. \u2047 We've continued to see Zoetis' livestock business show modest growth during the pandemic and recent economic challenges based on our strength internationally. \u2047 We see that international growth continuing this year while we continue to see declines in the U.S. driven primarily by generic competition in certain product lines. \u2047 Our competitive strategies in pricing and new life cycle innovations will help us mitigate some of that impact. \u2047 Livestock products are a key element of our global strategy and long-term growth, and we've continued to expand our vaccine product lines like Poulvac Procerta for poultry and Alpha Ject micro for fish, as well as Draxxin KP as a treatment for cattle. \u2047 We're also exploring more livestock innovations around greater efficiency, precision animal health, and more sustainable food production. \u2047 We've been focusing on our investments in vaccines for prevention and maintaining healthy animals, data analytics for more individualized animal care, and research into other sustainability improvements around immunotherapies. \u2047 I was particularly excited by two recently announced additions to our precision animal health portfolio, Performance Ranch, a new cloud-based cow-calf management software this simplified tracking of individual animal performance and health product usage, and our new Blockyard platform, which is blockchain technology developed in cooperation with IBM to provide a secure way to share information across different segments of the animal production supply chain. \u2047 For Zoetis, we continue to stay focused on our five strategic priorities for the long term, and we are optimistic about the growth drivers we see for 2022. \u2047 Pet care will remain a major growth driver for Zoetis globally based on our diverse and innovative portfolio. \u2047 We see continued growth potential for our dermatology portfolio which surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2021. \u2047 Our parasiticide, driven by our triple combination, Simparica Trio as well as Revolution Plus, Stronghold Plus, Simparica, and ProHeart 12 will continue to achieve growth as we gain market share in major markets and look at further life cycle innovations and label gains across the portfolio. \u2047 Librela and Solensia are monoclonal antibodies for control of osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats will continue to increase their revenue in 2022 primarily in the EU, and we're making regulatory progress for these products in the U.S. \u2047 We received FDA approval for Solensia in January with the launch expected in the second half of the year, and we still anticipate approval of Librela in the second half of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at a facility outside the U.S. As we begin 2022, we are seeing strong demand in the EU for Librela and Solensia and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. \u2047 We continue to optimize our global supply chain and manage ongoing challenges, which have been creating isolated constraints for Librela, Solensia, and some of our other products. \u2047 As always, maintaining a consistent reliable supply for our customers is our top priority, and we've been communicating with them about any impact to their orders. \u2047 We want to ensure all pets can continue their treatments without interruption especially for chronic treatment of OA pain. \u2047 Our global manufacturing network is working around the clock to ensure reliable supply for our customers as they did throughout 2021, and our full year guidance and strong growth reflects our views on supply. \u2047 Diagnostics is our next major growth driver in 2022 with a fully integrated point-of-care business that is prime for strong growth internationally, along with the expansion plans for a relatively new reference lab operations. \u2047 We are making significant progress in one of the fastest-growing markets for animal health. \u2047 We're adding more dedicated field force and customer service resources while developing more offerings that will leverage our portfolio across the continuum of care. \u2047 And finally, we see significant growth opportunities in emerging markets, including China and Brazil, where we see excellent opportunities for both our companion animal and livestock products based on increased medicalization and other positive trends. \u2047 Meanwhile, our R&D team, along with external partners, will continue to generate the industry's most productive pipeline in the years to come with more than $500 million in R&D spending in 2021 our largest ever annual investment for R&D. \u2047 We continue progressing research to address allergies, livestock health, chronic pain and inflammation, chronic kidney disease and diagnostics through our vaccines, therapeutics, and digital technology platforms. \u2047 Zoetis remains well-positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies, and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth to investors in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Now let me hand things off to Wetteny. \u2047 2021 was an exceptional year for us with revenue of $7.8 billion and adjusted net income of $2.2 billion both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. \u2047 Full year revenue grew 16% on a reported basis and 15% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 21% on a reported basis and 19% operationally. \u2047 Looking deeper into the 2021 numbers, price contributed 1% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 14%. \u2047 Volume growth consisted of 6% from other in-line products, 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio, and 3% from key dermatology products. \u2047 Revenue growth was again broad-based with the U.S. growing 14% and international growing 17% operationally. \u2047 Our strong performance was driven by our innovative, diverse and durable companion animal portfolio, which grew 27% operationally. \u2047 Our livestock business, which faced generic competition on key franchises as well as challenging macro conditions in certain markets, grew 1% operationally on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Performance in companion animal was led by our small animal parasiticide portfolio bolstered by full year sales of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $425 million, an increase of $305 million compared to 2020 sales. \u2047 Sales of Simparica also grew double digits for the year with operational revenue growth of 13%. \u2047 For the year, the Simparica franchise grew 82% operationally with revenue of approximately $0.75 billion. \u2047 Our key dermatology products performed incredibly well, growing 24% operationally with approximately $1.2 billion in revenue for the year, performing above our expectations. \u2047 Our diagnostics portfolio grew 21% operationally in the year with strong contributions from our U.S. and international segments, and we will continue to make meaningful investments in the coming years to drive global growth. \u2047 represents larger growth opportunities geographically and feel we are favorably positioned to capture future growth in those markets. \u2047 Our livestock performance in 2021 depicts the importance of geographical diversification. \u2047 Generic competition and challenging market conditions weighed on our U.S. performance but were offset by solid growth internationally primarily in emerging markets. \u2047 The modest lifestyle growth on a global basis was in line with our expectations for the year. \u2047 Moving on to our Q4 financial results. \u2047 We posted another strong quarter with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 9% on both a reported and operational basis. \u2047 Adjusted net income of $474 million is an increase of 8% on a reported basis and 5% operationally. \u2047 Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 1% is from price and 8% from volume. \u2047 Volume growth of 8% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio, 2% from key dermatology products, and 1% from other in-line products. \u2047 Companion animal products led the way in terms of -- growth, growing 21% operationally, with livestock declining 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. \u2047 Small animal parasiticides were the largest contributor to growth in the quarter where our innovative and diverse flea, tick, and heartworm portfolio was 32% operationally. \u2047 Simparica Trio posted revenue of $124 million, representing operational growth of 106% versus the comparable 2020 period and the third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $100 million. \u2047 Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, again, had significant global growth in the quarter with $316 million of revenue, representing 23% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 27% in the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 Our livestock business declined 6% in the quarter as a result of generic competition for DRAXXIN unfavorable market conditions in the U.S., primarily resulting from elevated input costs as well as softer conditions in China, loss driven by reduced pork prices. \u2047 Our fish business grew double digits in the quarter, and along with the strength of our emerging markets, partially offset the broader decline. \u2047 Overall livestock performance in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. \u2047 Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. \u2047 U.S. revenue grew 9%, with companion animal products growing 20% and livestock sales declining by 13%. \u2047 U.S. pet care vet practice trends remained robust in Q4, with practice revenue growing approximately 8% with visits growing 3% despite challenging prior year comps. \u2047 Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales from our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. \u2047 We are driving growth in both therapeutic areas by making meaningful investments primarily through direct-to-consumer advertising and field force, and we continue to be pleased by the return on investment the programs are yielding. \u2047 growth in Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $114 million growing more than 100%. \u2047 We also met our clean penetration target and continue to take share within the clinics. \u2047 Key dermatology sales were $216 million for the quarter, growing 22% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each growing significantly. \u2047 Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic, and we'll continue to invest meaningfully in this space as the large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain untreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. \u2047 U.S. livestock fell 13% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business which, as expected, was challenged by generic competition for Draxxin as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. \u2047 Our poultry business was negatively affected by reduced disease pressure from smaller flock sizes as well as generic competition while swine faced competitive pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccine products. \u2047 Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on a reported and operational basis in the quarter. \u2047 Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally, and livestock revenue declined 2% operationally. \u2047 Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our key dermatology products, our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of OA pain,"], "gold_summary": ["sees fy earnings per share $4.75 to $4.87.  \u2047  sees fy revenue $8.325 billion to $8.475 billion.
