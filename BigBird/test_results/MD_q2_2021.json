{"article": ["One quick bit of housekeeping. \u2047 Cory and I will be participating in the Raymond James consumer conference on September 14 which will be held virtually. \u2047 We'll publish more details related to the time and date a couple of weeks in advance. \u2047 With that, let's move on to today's call. \u2047 Investors should familiarize themselves with the full range of risk factors that could impact our results. \u2047 Those are filed with our Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u2047 I also want to remind everyone that today's call is being recorded. \u2047 An archived version of the call will be available on our website. \u2047 This is an important call today, perhaps the most important call with the investment community over the past year. \u2047 It has nothing to do with the fact that we posted another strong quarter and remain on pace for a record year. \u2047 It's because we're finally at the inflection point, everyone knew was coming. \u2047 Yes, we're starting the run-up against tough comps in both businesses. \u2047 Yes, we're starting to see consumers get back to their normal routines. \u2047 And yes, like a lot of consumer companies, the cost pressures we're seeing from commodities are starting to feel unrelenting. \u2047 But as I take a deeper look at our business, I can't help but feel positive. \u2047 If you only look at a quarterly P&L, you can't possibly understand what's happening here. \u2047 You have to dig, you have to analyze. \u2047 You have to find the answers to questions you've never been thought about asking in the past. \u2047 For more than a year, I've been telling anyone who would listen that I believe Scotts Miracle-Gro would exit COVID as a fundamentally stronger company. \u2047 And the deeper we dig, the more we analyze, the more I'm convinced that is exactly what's happened. \u2047 Our consumer base today is vastly bigger and more engaged than prior to the pandemic. \u2047 Our ability to engage on their terms is better today due to the vast improvements in our direct-to-consumer initiatives. \u2047 And our ability to provide them the best possible outcomes has been made even easier by an innovation team that continues to turn out important new innovation. \u2047 Our growth engine, Hawthorne, continues to outperform the market and is positioning itself for long-term success. \u2047 We've built competitive advantages that others in the industry can't match. \u2047 We brought science-based innovation to this industry, and we continue to embrace a vision that is driving us to explore new and creative opportunities for growth. \u2047 In addition to the strength of our businesses, our balance sheet gives us more financial flexibility than we've had in a decade. \u2047 We have opportunities to invest in immediate growth, and we'll pursue those. \u2047 We have opportunities to invest in long-term growth, and we'll pursue that too. \u2047 And we have the opportunity to return cash to shareholders, which we'll also pursue especially given the recent pullback in our share price. \u2047 We're not doing everything perfectly here. \u2047 But when I look for major weaknesses, I just don't see them right now. \u2047 We've taken full advantage of the unique opportunity that presented itself over the past 18 months and have put ourselves in a great position. \u2047 First, I want to discuss the continued strength of our U.S. consumer business. \u2047 Consumer engagement remain strong; and by the time we navigate through the next year, we expect to have retained nearly all of the growth we captured in 2020. \u2047 I'm not sure many other CPG companies can say that. \u2047 Again, the trends are extremely strong. \u2047 We were up 48% in the quarter, and we continue to expect growth of 40% to 45% on a full-year basis. \u2047 We continue exploring opportunities that are bigger in scope, and we are increasingly committed to finding creative ways to invest in other areas of the cannabis industry. \u2047 Fourth, I'll share some early thoughts about our view of next year. \u2047 We're not providing fiscal '22 guidance today, but we do have a working thesis about next year, and I believe long-term shareholders will like what they hear. \u2047 And fifth, I want to touch on our evolving thoughts about returning cash to shareholders. \u2047 Let's start with U.S. consumer. \u2047 Clearly, we've done a better job on the top line than we expected coming into the year. \u2047 Consumer engagement exceeded our expectations and allowed us to call up our numbers twice this season. \u2047 Of course, a lot of that benefit in excess of $1 a share has been offset by commodity pressures that every company in the consumer product space is trying to navigate. \u2047 I'll let Cory dive deeper into those details. \u2047 I want to focus my time on the strong underlying foundation of the business. \u2047 The most critical takeaway is this: Consumer engagement remains extremely high. \u2047 Entering the season, our research suggested about 85% of consumers who came into the category last year would return. \u2047 We believe the actual number was probably closer to 75%; however, we're confident we benefited from a higher overall level of participation as one-third of all consumers said they increased their participation in our category this spring. \u2047 When we subtract consumers who did less gardening this year from those who did more, our data suggests participation was up 8%. \u2047 And that aligns pretty well with consumer purchase of our products at our largest retail partners. \u2047 Entering August, POS dollars at our largest four retail partners were up 4%. \u2047 In units, the number is 8%. \u2047 There's a story here and it's important to understand. \u2047 In most years, the gap between units and dollars is negligible. \u2047 In 2020, however, retailers did almost no promotional activity, so POS dollars far outpaced units. \u2047 This year, retailers promoted more than in 2020. \u2047 The change in their behavior meant the difference between POS dollars and units swung back in the other direction. \u2047 In our soils business, where four-for-10 and five-for-10 promotions were reintroduced, POS dollars are up 5% year to date. \u2047 But units, a more accurate reflection of our shipments, as well as consumer activity, are up 8%. \u2047 In mulch, dollars were up 11% and units up 20%. \u2047 And our other branded categories where the year-over-year impact of promotional activity is less pronounced, like lawn fertilizer, weed control, and grass seed, POS dollars were up 3%, 8%, and 14%, respectively. \u2047 This is the third straight year we're seeing double-digit growth in grass seed. \u2047 So across all categories, the numbers we're posting would be good in any year. \u2047 So we're extremely pleased given the tough comps. \u2047 Still, we've given up a lot of the POS gains we reported on the last call when the year-to-date number was plus 20%. \u2047 Most of the reduction was expected because of the difficult comparisons. \u2047 However, we believe the result would have been better if had not been for the weather challenges that undoubtedly drove the number lower in May and June. \u2047 On Mother's Day weekend, historically the largest weekend of the gardening season, it snowed in some key markets. \u2047 Memorial Day brought record cold through most of the Midwest and Northeast. \u2047 Father's Day was not much better. \u2047 In fact, June as a whole was extremely wet in much of the Midwest. \u2047 And of course, the record heat and drought conditions in the Western U.S. have not helped either. \u2047 We believe the impact from weather was magnified this year. \u2047 Last year, when people were working from home, we saw a lot more POS happening on weekdays than we were accustomed to seeing. \u2047 So if the weekend weather was lousy, it wasn't a big deal because more people were shopping on weekdays. \u2047 But this year, because weekday foot traffic was closer to normal, the weekends have become much more important again. \u2047 So lousy weather is more difficult to overcome this year and we've seen a lot of it. \u2047 This is not an excuse. \u2047 Weather can impact the business and it was a significant headwind this year. \u2047 By September 30, I suspect weather will have cost us at least 2 points of growth in fiscal '21. \u2047 Nonetheless, consumer engagement remains encouraging. \u2047 Our third quarter historically accounts for about 55% of full-year POS. \u2047 In the 13-week period from April through June, POS was down 1% this year compared to 2020, but it's up 24% in those same weeks compared to 2019. \u2047 If we look only at the last nine weeks of that period, that's when we started to hit tougher comps. \u2047 POS was down 12% from 2020 levels. \u2047 However, it's up 30% from 2019 during that same nine-week window. \u2047 If we extrapolate the current trends for the balance of the year, we expect full-year POS dollars to be up slightly from last year. \u2047 POS units are likely to be up low to mid-single digits. \u2047 Compared to 2019, we expect POS for 2021 to be up more than 25%. \u2047 The current consumer trends, combined with planned higher retail inventory levels, give us a high degree of confidence in our full-year sales growth guidance for the U.S. consumer business, which we set at the range of 7% to 9%. \u2047 Behind the numbers, there are a lot of great stories. \u2047 I'd love to share details on all of them, but I'm going to turn the page and share some of the highlights from Hawthorne where we continue to see strength across the board. \u2047 Through June, sales are 60% higher on a year-to-date basis as the business continues to build on its market-leading position. \u2047 In Q3, our lighting business grew 77%. \u2047 Within that number, our market-leading Gavita brand grew at more than twice that rate. \u2047 We continue to see new growth facilities come online across the country and the retrofit market remained an important part of the story in legacy markets in the Western United States. \u2047 Our success in lighting continues to be led by innovation. \u2047 In particular, we continue to see great success with our new LED lighting products that provide growers a one-for-one replacement for existing, high-pressure sodium lights. \u2047 Outside of lighting, we continue to see strength in the consumable category as well, which is a more accurate reflection of growth in the actual cannabis market. \u2047 Nutrient sales were up 54% in the quarter and growing media was up 32%. \u2047 Our signature brands significantly outperformed the overall category. \u2047 General Hydroponics grew roughly 30 points more than the total nutrient portfolio, and our Mother Earth and Botanicare brands grew three times faster than the rest of our growing media business. \u2047 The across-the-board strength led to the 48% growth we saw in the quarter, which ended with our largest sales month ever in June. \u2047 The growth rate we expect for the full year is a little more than two times higher than our initial guidance. \u2047 The upside this year allowed us to upgrade our talent, enhance our innovation efforts and improve our marketing. \u2047 We expect those investments will help drive the business again next year and the years to follow. \u2047 The acquisition of HydroLogic is pretty straightforward. \u2047 This is an easily integrated bolt-on deal that is highly strategic. \u2047 HydroLogic is a leading provider of products and systems related to water filtration and purification. \u2047 That makes it a strong complement to our existing irrigation supply business in a high-margin category. \u2047 We continue to have more M&A opportunities in the pipeline in both business segments than we can digest right now. \u2047 The challenge for Hawthorne is that many of the targets are small- to medium-sized businesses. \u2047 You might think that small deals are easy to get done. \u2047 In most cases, it's just the opposite. \u2047 The lack of sophisticated IT systems and financial controls makes the due diligence process harder and more time-consuming. \u2047 And we're not going to rush the deal just to get it done, but I will tell you we're making good progress. \u2047 Separately, we remain committed to putting capital to work in areas of the cannabis industry that are closer to the end consumer and to the grower and within the balance of current federal law, as well as the requirements of our lenders. \u2047 After months of work by an internal task force, we've created a process that will allow us to make nonequity investments in other entities that invest in cannabis brands and operations. \u2047 In fact, we've been in discussions with potential partners to bring this strategy to life and hope to see significant movement in the near future. \u2047 We've developed a highly successful business in Hawthorne based on the current state-authorized marketplace. \u2047 Even though we've never been involved with plant-touching activities, we understand the space, as well as anyone, perhaps better than anyone. \u2047 Our evolving vision is to create the optionality to have an early mover advantage in the broader U.S. cannabis market when federal law allows. \u2047 There is little doubt this industry is poised for significant growth. \u2047 And given our track record, I believe we have an absolute right to win here. \u2047 I look forward to sharing more details in the months ahead. \u2047 Speaking of the months ahead, I realize everyone wants to know what's in store for fiscal '22, so let me change gears and share some high-level thoughts. \u2047 The easy part of this equation is Hawthorne. \u2047 The run rate of this business segment remains strong. \u2047 We just completed an acquisition and hopefully, there are more on the horizon. \u2047 We continue to extend our leadership in the overall marketplace. \u2047 We continue to face the same challenge we've had for several years. \u2047 We entered fiscal '22 against pretty tough comps. \u2047 But based on everything we're seeing, it's hard to imagine growth being below 10% to 20% next year. \u2047 I know that feels like a conservative estimate to many, perhaps it is, and perhaps our guidance range will be different. \u2047 But taking a conservative approach has worked for us over the past several years and we'll continue down that same path. \u2047 I'm not going to overcommit to growth here. \u2047 The more challenging questions for next year are related to the growth in the U.S. consumer business and the continued pressures from higher commodity costs. \u2047 I'll cover the first part, Cory will cover the second. \u2047 We still have two months to go in the year, so Mike and I are working to keep the team focused all the way to the finish line. \u2047 That said, I like where we are. \u2047 That remains my view. \u2047 We're probably going to continue to feel some top-line pressure through next April because of the difficult comps. \u2047 So to some extent, fiscal '22 will be a mirror image of this year,"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted non-gaap earnings per share $3.98.  \u2047  sees fy
