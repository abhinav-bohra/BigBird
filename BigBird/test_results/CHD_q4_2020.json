{"article": ["I'm going to begin with the safe harbor statement. \u2047 I recommend that you read it at your leisure. \u2047 We have our entire management team on the call today available for Q&A after the formal pitch. \u2047 We have a lot of slides and several presenters but I'm going to give you the short story upfront. \u2047 2020 was a turbulent year. \u2047 We emerged from 2020 much stronger as a company. \u2047 We like to say that we do our best work and we're going to jam. \u2047 That's true for 2020. \u2047 We protected our people, we found a way to run the plants and warehouses safely, we set production and shipping records, we figured out how to make hand sanitizer in our U.K. plant, we operated the company with 2,000 remote employees, we pivoted our marketing messages to support a 60% increase in e-commerce sales, we installed the new packaging lines with the assistance of off-site engineers using Google classes, we added overflow warehouses, and we validated new suppliers and co-manufacturers. \u2047 In our communities, we delivered masks and hand sanitizers to hospitals where we live and donated to food banks, and recently our Mason City, Iowa plant loaned an ultra-cold freezer to a local hospital to store the COVID-19 vaccine. \u2047 Consumer demand drove huge sales growth, which enabled us to overcome significant incremental COVID costs and incremental U.S. government tariffs. \u2047 But it also gave us the opportunity to invest in our future, which we did in the second half. \u2047 Looking ahead to '21, we're optimistic that the vaccine will help the global business environment. \u2047 We operate in many categories and we do expect pluses and minuses, depending on the category. \u2047 All in, we expect to deliver 3% organic sales growth and 6% to 8% earnings per share growth in 2021. \u2047 And this is on top of almost 10% organic growth and 15% earnings per share growth in 2020, which exceeded our 2020 outlook when we last spoke in October. \u2047 Our Evergreen model is intact. \u2047 Before we start the formal part of the program, here is a brief video that is a look back on 2020. \u2047 Okay, here's today's agenda. \u2047 I'm going to begin by describing who we are as a company, I'm going to be followed by Britta Bomhard, who is our Chief Marketing Officer. \u2047 Britta's going to talk about the categories, how they performed in 2020 and how we expect them to perform in '21. \u2047 Steve Cugine's going to come up and tell us about our new products in '21. \u2047 Steve Cugine, by the way, will be retiring in the middle of '21. \u2047 Steve has had a spectacular career with Church & Dwight, spanning over 20 years. \u2047 For the past seven years, he has been running our international business, which has been a stellar performer. \u2047 And Steve is going to introduce Barry Bruno, who has been with the company for a number of years and he has been Steve's right-hand man in growing the international business. \u2047 I'm going to come back and talk about the animal productivity story as well as how we run the company and also talk about our M&A platform. \u2047 We're going to wrap up with Rick Dierker, our CFO, to run us through the financials. \u2047 And now, who we are. \u2047 Whether you've been a short term one year shareholder of Church & Dwight, three, five, 10 or 15 years, you're very pleased with our performance. \u2047 We have been a stellar performer in the CPG space for many, many years, we're known for our consistency. \u2047 And one of the reasons for our consistency is our Evergreen model. \u2047 Every year, we expect to grow our top line organically 3% and our bottom line 8%. \u2047 That's true in '21, it will be true in '22, '23, '24, '25. \u2047 You might ask, how's that been working out for you? \u2047 Well, if you take a look back over the last 10 years, you'll see that we've exceeded the 3% target every year except 2013 and 2017. \u2047 With respect to 8% EPS, you can see over many, many years, we're consistent. \u2047 So Church & Dwight is a consistent performer. \u2047 We have an Evergreen model that is very familiar to all of our existing shareholders, 3% top line, 8% bottom line. \u2047 Now, where does the 3% organic growth come from? \u2047 Well, 2% from the U.S., 6% from international and 5% from the specialty products. \u2047 This is our evergreen target, but it also happens to be the targets for 2021. \u2047 We expect to deliver these three numbers for each of those divisions in '21. \u2047 We focus on power brands, we have 13 power brands in our company that are displayed here on this chart. \u2047 And those 13 power brands, deliver 80% of our revenues and profits. \u2047 And we're very balanced as a company. \u2047 About half of our consumer business is in household and half is in personal care and we have a small specialty products business, which is a combination of bulk sodium bicarbonate and animal productivity products. \u2047 We have a nice split between premium and value, 58% premium and 42% value. \u2047 What this means is, we operate and perform well in virtually any economic environment. \u2047 With respect to our geographic split. \u2047 We have a lot of room to grow internationally. \u2047 We're largely a U.S. company, only 17% of our consumer business is international, so lots and lots of runway. \u2047 That's going to generate a lot of growth for us in future years. \u2047 One of our big advantages is that we're nimble, we're small, we only have 5,000 employees. \u2047 We have the highest sales per employee of any CPG company, and it helps us three ways. \u2047 Quick decision-making, ease of communication and ability to adapt. \u2047 And the ability to adapt was highlighted in 2020 when you saw how we reacted to the pandemic. \u2047 We have a long history of growth through acquisitions. \u2047 If you went back to the year 2000, the only brand we owned was ARM & HAMMER. \u2047 We were up only $800 million in sales in the year 2000. \u2047 In '21, we're going to cross $5 billion. \u2047 And of those 13 power brands, 12 of them were acquired since 2001. \u2047 If you go back just a few years in 2015, we were a laggard when it came to online sales, less than 1% of our sales were online. \u2047 At the end of 2019, it was 8%, at the end of '20, largely due to COVID, it's over 13%. \u2047 So we regard us as a leader now, with respect to e-commerce. \u2047 We have a low exposure to private label, only 12%, and if you look at the categories, there's only five of our 17 categories where we have significant private label share and those shares have been pretty stable over the last five years. \u2047 Now, I'm going to bring up Britta Bomhard, our Chief Marketing Officer, to take us through the categories in the U.S. business. \u2047 As you have heard from Matt, we plan to deliver another year of growth in 2021 on top of an outstanding performance in 2020, and in line with our Evergreen model. \u2047 There are five distinctive drivers for our growth in 2021. \u2047 Number one, tailwinds on vitamin gummy category growth accelerated by strong brand, Vitafusion. \u2047 Second, Waterpik, despite dental offices and many retailers being closed for part of the year, we sold slightly more power flosses in 2020 than in 2019. \u2047 Removing these roadblocks, growth will be even stronger. \u2047 Three, Flawless sales will benefit from new products, a great influencer boost and a rebound of footfall. \u2047 Four, some brands will rebound where social distancing really impacted sales. \u2047 With vaccines coming, consumers will socialize more. \u2047 And five, last but most importantly, we strengthened our brands and improved our media spend effectiveness. \u2047 We create brands consumers love. \u2047 2020 was a year of dramatic changes, how consumers use media, which allowed us many test-and-learn experiments feeding our predictive data model and giving us confidence that our media dollars will be again more effective in 2021. \u2047 But, let's start with tailwinds. \u2047 We are in the right categories. \u2047 We saw growth in 12 of our 17 categories, average 9.8% overall. \u2047 We saw an over 50% growth in vitamin, double-digit growth in baking soda and single-digit in many other categories. \u2047 The only category with double-digit decline is Power Flosses, and that is in the Nielsen universe. \u2047 This is important as Nielsen only measures about one quarter of Power Floss's sales. \u2047 And I will show you numbers from the whole universe later. \u2047 We have high expectations for category growth in 2021 and I will speak to them in more detail. \u2047 Four categories will stay on elevated levels, five categories will come down from COVID peaks but some to higher levels, five categories will bounce back from COVID impact, three categories will be steady. \u2047 The underlying brand for category growth is household penetration. \u2047 As you can see in this chart, 11 of our 17 categories increased household penetration. \u2047 This means more consumers are buying this category. \u2047 It wasn't only consumers buying these categories, they bought our brands in unprecedented numbers. \u2047 We added 8.6 million households to ARM & HAMMER, More Power to You, 2.4 million to OxiClean Stain Fighter and in the second half alone, Vitafusion added 3 million more households. \u2047 We know that we have category-leading repeat rate. \u2047 This means once these households experience our brands, they enjoy them and come back to them, laying the foundation for strong growth in 2021. \u2047 Let's look at some of the category behaviors one by one. \u2047 Vitamins grew an amazing 58% in consumption. \u2047 You can see the original stock up peak in March, but also that increased levels continued for the rest of the year. \u2047 It takes 66 days to form a new habit, and consumers clearly formed new habits, regarding taking vitamins. \u2047 20% of consumer started taking vitamins, 57%, that means more than half, are now taking vitamins daily. \u2047 So it's not only more consumers taking vitamins, they also take them more frequently, and another one-third of consumers plan to add more types of vitamins to their baskets, planning to add immune-strengthening, for example. \u2047 Last but not least, when taking vitamins, consumers preferred gummies over other forms. \u2047 You can see that the share of gummies on total increased by nearly one-third, that is, it is now 23% and who would be better placed to profit from that growth than the number 1 vitamin gummy, Vitafusion. \u2047 Let's look at the category of Power Flosses. \u2047 Nielsen only captures about one quarter of category sales, that is why I show you unit sales across all classes of trade and you can see that after the decline at the beginning of the year with the lockdown, there was a strong rebound. \u2047 In total, for 2020, we achieved slightly more unit sales than in 2019, despite dentists and certain retailers being closed for significant periods of time, which also means that we came out strong by the end of the year and this momentum will continue and only accelerate with more dentist office opened up and resuming higher traffic, there is only upside. \u2047 Women's grooming saw two opposing trends. \u2047 On one hand, retailer stores closed over reduced foot traffic reducing sales, on the other hand, spa closures in COVID concerns driving do at home movement and increasing sales. \u2047 Our Flawless team quickly spotted the trend and turned it around with spa at home products, which have just launched. \u2047 We now offer solutions for women who do not want to go to a beautician and get a face massage or do not want to visit to the nail salon. \u2047 And as nail salons and spas have closed down due COVID, we believe that women will continue to prefer at-home treatment. \u2047 So here are two of our exciting new products. \u2047 A facial massage cleanser and a salon nail tool kit. \u2047 Steve will talk more about them later. \u2047 Moreover, we have secured an icon to speak for the brand, Halle Berry, who will be even more popular, if that's even possible, in 2021 due to the launch of her new film, Moonfall. \u2047 In addition, we have Ashley Graham, Amelia Hamlin and Dove Cameron as enthusiasts promoting Flawless. \u2047 It will be an exciting year for Flawless. \u2047 Flawless means being perfect to you. \u2047 Be you, be flawless. \u2047 Now to our biggest category, laundry. \u2047 As you can see, laundry grew 5.5% in 2020 but was a lot of swings due to consumers' stockpiling and changing habits. \u2047 Being more concerned about germs and being home, allowing for more time to do laundry that will continue as tailwinds for 2021. \u2047 Cat Litter will also benefit from changed habits that continue. \u2047 It is hard to get good statistics on cat ownership but we do know that 6% more households bought Cat Litter in 2020, leading me to believe that this is the minimum of additional cat owners. \u2047 What this number won't capture is the households who got additional cats and as consumers want to spend more time with their cat instead of going to stores, we have seen a significant increase in online sales, which are not captured in these Nielsen sales. \u2047 Then, there are categories, which are impacted by social distancing. \u2047 We call these the social interaction categories. \u2047 One of them is dry shampoo, where we had seen category decline due to store closures and like browsing in store. \u2047 Here, the advance of vaccination and the associated expected increase of socializing will bounce back the category. \u2047 And even more eagerly awaited bounce back of sales is in the condom category, as condoms mean pleasure. \u2047 18 to 24 year olds can't wait to get their social lives back and with college campuses reopening, 2021 looks promising. \u2047 Now that we've gone through the different categories, let me summarize changed consumer behaviors due to COVID that we think will stay and help our business. \u2047 Number one, self-care at home for our hair care and removal hair businesses like Nair and Flawless, cat ownership for Cat Litter, higher consciousness of germs and cleanliness benefiting ARM & HAMMER, OxiClean, XTRA but also Kaboom, and four, awareness trend with a regular daily intake of supplements, Vitafusion, L'il Critters and Viviscal"], "gold_summary":

\u2047  in 2021, we expect several categories to remain at elevated consumption levels.  \u2047  expect modest growth from laundry category in 2021.  \u2047  expect growth in water flossers in 2021
