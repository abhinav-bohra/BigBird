{"article": ["A playback of today's call will be archived on our Investor Relations website located at investors. \u2047 dicks.com for approximately 12 months. \u2047 And finally, a few admin items. \u2047 First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. \u2047 Our consolidated same-store sales calculation include stores that we temporarily closed last year as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures because of COVID-19. \u2047 Accordingly, our method of calculation might not be the same as other retailers. \u2047 Next, as a reminder, due to the uneven nature of 2020, we planned 2021 off of the 2019 baseline. \u2047 Accordingly, we will compare 2021 sales and earnings results against both 2019 and 2020. \u2047 And lastly, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our fourth quarter 2021 earnings results before the market opens on March 8, 2022, with our subsequent earnings call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. \u2047 We're extremely pleased to announce another very strong quarter in which we delivered significant sales and earnings growth over both last year and 2019. \u2047 Our strategies continue to work as we reimagine the athlete experience in our core business and with the new concepts. \u2047 We have driven strong profitable growth at DICK's. \u2047 And earlier this year, we launched two DICK'S House of Sport stores, highly experiential destinations that are redefining sports retail. \u2047 The innovations we've made in our Golf Galaxy business are performing extremely well. \u2047 And our second Public Land store recently opened, focusing on the outdoor activities. \u2047 Looking ahead, I couldn't be more excited about the future of DICK's Sporting Goods. \u2047 We now expect to deliver comp sales of over 20% for 2021, and remain very confident in the long-term prospects of our business. \u2047 Before diving into our Q3 results, I think it's important to recognize that our current success is a result of a transformational journey that began in the back half of 2017 when we started to make meaningful changes across our business. \u2047 We also improved our service and selling culture, made our stores more experiential and reallocated floor space to regionally relevant and growing categories. \u2047 These changes fueled improved results and significantly improved our comp sales trajectory, well before the pandemic. \u2047 For years, we've also invested in technology and data science to build our best-in-class omnichannel platform. \u2047 This allowed us to quickly capitalize on athlete needs and strong consumer demand throughout 2020, and deliver our full-year comp sales increase of nearly 10%. \u2047 We announced today that we've raised our full-year guidance for the third time this year, and now expect our comp sales to increase between 24% and 25%. \u2047 During a time when consumers are making lasting lifestyle changes with an increased focus on health and fitness and greater participation in outdoor activities, we believe that DICK's Sporting Goods has become synonymous with sport in the United States. \u2047 Nearly, our entire category portfolio has rebaselined meaningfully higher versus pre-COVID sales levels. \u2047 We've capitalized on strong consumer demand and have gained considerable market share in key categories, driven by enhanced product access, service, and omnichannel capabilities. \u2047 Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue gaining share and we remain optimistic about the long-term demand trends in our most important categories like athletic apparel, footwear, team sports and golf. \u2047 We also remain very optimistic about longer-term EBT margin, driven by a number of permanent changes versus pre-COVID levels. \u2047 These changes include a highly differentiated product assortment that is less susceptible to broader promotional pressures; more granular management in promotions and significantly higher profitability of our eCommerce channel. \u2047 Now getting back to our Q3 results. \u2047 Consolidated same-store sales increased 12.2% on top of a 23.2% increase in the same period of last year, and a 6% increase in Q3 2019. \u2047 Driven by our strong sales and gross margin rate expansion, on a non-GAAP basis, our third quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.19, increased 59% over last year and 513% over Q3 2019. \u2047 Our Q3 comps were supported by broad-based growth across our business, as our strong execution, diverse category portfolio and world-class omnichannel platform helped us continue to capitalize on and meet robust consumer demand despite a dynamic global supply chain. \u2047 We're continuing to see strong retention of the 8.5 million new athletes we acquired last year, and we added another 1.7 million new athletes during this quarter. \u2047 Our active athlete database is at a record high. \u2047 Our increasingly differentiated product assortment, combined with our disciplined promotional strategy and cadence is continuing to drive significantly higher merchandise margin rate. \u2047 During the quarter, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 301 basis points versus 2020 and by 578 basis points versus 2019. \u2047 As we discussed previously, we're focused on enhancing the athlete experience across our entire omnichannel ecosystem. \u2047 In our stores, we continue to make DICK's a great place to work, as we know that our people are our competitive differentiator and a great teammate experience drives a great athlete experience. \u2047 In fact, we recently earned a place on Fortune's list of Best Workplaces in Retail for 2021. \u2047 We're also engaging our athletes with new and elevated service standards and making our stores more experiential. \u2047 These strategies are working and continue to set us apart within the marketplace. \u2047 During the quarter, our brick-and-mortar stores comped up approximately 15% versus last year and delivered a 31% sales increase when compared to 2019. \u2047 Importantly, our stores continue to be the hub of our omnichannel strategy, enabling over 90% of our total sales and fulfilling approximately 70% of our online sales in Q3. \u2047 Moving to our eCommerce business. \u2047 During the quarter, we were pleased to deliver online sales growth of 1%, which was on top of a 95% increase in the same period last year. \u2047 Our online sales remained substantially above pre-COVID levels, increasing nearly 100% when compared to the same period in 2019. \u2047 Importantly, we also continue to drive a significant improvement in the profitability of our eCommerce channel by leveraging fixed costs, sustained athlete adoption of in-store pickup and curbside, as well as fewer and more targeted promotions. \u2047 Beyond our omnichannel platform, our portfolio of brands is a tremendous asset. \u2047 We continue to invest substantially in our highly profitable and growing vertical brands. \u2047 Key brands including DSG, CALIA and VRST are driving exclusivity within our assortment and gaining meaningful traction with our athletes. \u2047 At the same time, while many national brands continue to narrow distribution and focus more on their most strategic partners, DICK's offers them something unique and valuable. \u2047 We are rooted in sport and can showcase an entire brand of portfolio, including apparel, footwear and hard lines across our over 800 stores and online. \u2047 Our brand partners continue to make significant investments in our business every year and provide us with increasing allocations of exclusive and differentiated products. \u2047 These top-of-the-line products are highly coveted and rarely promoted, driving significant sales and margin momentum. \u2047 Our strategic partnerships with key brands have never been stronger, and we're making big bets with important brand partners. \u2047 To that end, we recently announced a groundbreaking new partnership with Nike that we see as truly transformative for the sports industry. \u2047 Through this collaboration, DICK'S and Nike will create unmatched value for our athletes through exclusive products, experiences, content and other specialized offers. \u2047 Together, we'll embrace our collective strengths and capabilities to expand our reach, connect with even more athletes and most importantly serve them better. \u2047 Our companies have a long and successful history of working together, and this demonstrates a deepening of the DICK's and Nike relationship. \u2047 This partnership is aimed at driving growth for both companies, while serving our customers in a personalized way. \u2047 At DICK's, part of our strategy is to lead with mobile, and we're excited to launch this partnership through a connected marketplace exclusively in our DICK's mobile app. \u2047 Looking ahead, we will explore additional opportunities to work with Nike and our other strategic partners across our respective physical and digital properties to further enhance convenience, experiences and content for our athletes. \u2047 Now, I'd like to provide a few updates on our newest concept. \u2047 First, we remain very pleased with our first 2 DICK's House of Sport stores in Rochester and Knoxville. \u2047 House of Sport is built around experience, service, community and product, setting an unparalleled standard for sports retail and athlete engagement. \u2047 Moving forward, we are excited to continue to refine and grow House of Sport, while pulling key learnings into the rest of the DICK's chain. \u2047 We're also excited by the early results of our first two Golf Galaxy performance centers located outside of Boston and Minneapolis, St Paul. \u2047 Golf Galaxy Performance Center has been completely redesigned and equipped with TrackMan and BioMech golf technologies. \u2047 We've also invested in talent to ensure our teammates become trusted advisors to golf enthusiast of all levels. \u2047 In addition to innovating within our core business, we also launched Public Lands, a new omnichannel specialty concept to better serve outdoor athletes. \u2047 Our first Public Lands store recently opened here in Pittsburgh, and our second store opened in Columbus just a few weeks ago. \u2047 We also launched publiclands.com, a complete eCommerce experience for the outdoor enthusiasts. \u2047 While it's still early, Public Lands is off to a strong start and we are very enthusiastic about this growth opportunity and its goal to get more people outside, exploring and protecting Americas Public Lands. \u2047 Before concluding, I want to spend a moment on the supply chain. \u2047 Amidst the very dynamic environment, our team has done an excellent job working with our vendor partners and with our vertical brand manufacturers to ensure a robust flow of product to meet strong demand. \u2047 We ordered aggressively to get ahead of this disruption and our quarter ending inventory levels increased 7.3% compared to the end of the same period last year. \u2047 While there will continue to be inventory challenges across the marketplace, our fourth quarter is off to a strong start and we feel that we are well positioned within our industry this holiday season. \u2047 In closing, we have exciting growth opportunities ahead of us. \u2047 And as Ed said, we are very confident in the longer-term prospects of our business. \u2047 As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities and reimagine the athlete experience, we believe the investments we've made to transform our business will strengthen our leadership position within the marketplace. \u2047 Our teammates are at the center of this transformation. \u2047 After joining the company in 2017 as SVP of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer, Navdeep was appointed to the CFO position last month. \u2047 Navdeep's impact on our business has been phenomenal. \u2047 Over the last four years, he has led most of the finance functions in the organization and he has become a trusted partner to our entire executive team. \u2047 He has also driven companywide productivity efforts, served on our long-term Strategic Committee and he played a really critical role in securing financing at the outset of COVID. \u2047 Prior to DICK's, Navdeep spent 11 years at Advance Auto Parts in various leadership roles, most recently serving as Senior Vice President of Finance. \u2047 Earlier in his career, Navdeep held a variety of management roles at Sprint Nextel and he served as a lieutenant in the Indian Navy. \u2047 Navdeep's keen financial acumen and strategic vision will be instrumental to the continued growth and success of DICK's. \u2047 And with that, Navdeep, it is my pleasure to hand it over to you. \u2047 With three quarters of the year now behind us, our consistent, strong results have demonstrated our ability to serve our athletes in a very differentiated way, while driving toward another record sales and earnings here in 2021. \u2047 Let's begin with a brief review of our third quarter results. \u2047 Like Lauren said, we are excited to report a consolidated sales increase of 13.9% to approximately $2.75 billion. \u2047 Consolidated same-store sales increased 12.2% on top of a 23.2% increase in the same period last year, and a 6% increase in Q3 of 2019. \u2047 Our strong comps were driven by growth across each of our three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear, as well as an 8.5% increase in transaction and a 3.7% increase in average ticket. \u2047 When compared to 2019, consolidated sales increased 40%. \u2047 Our brick-and-mortar stores comped up approximately 15% versus 2020, and delivered a 31% sales increase when compared to 2019, with roughly the same square footage. \u2047 Our eCommerce sales increased 1% versus last year on top of a 95% online sales increase in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Compared to Q3 of 2019, our eCommerce sales increased 97%. \u2047 As a percent of total net sales, our online business has grown from 13% in 2019% to 19% in the current quarter. \u2047 eCommerce penetration was 21% last year. \u2047 Moving to gross profit. \u2047 Gross profit in the third quarter was $1.06 billion, or 38.45% of net sales, and improved 354 basis points compared to last year. \u2047 This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 301 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 111 basis points from sales increase. \u2047 The increase in merchandise margin was primarily driven by fewer promotions due to our increasingly differentiated assortment and disciplined promotional strategy, as certain categories in the marketplace continue to be supply constrained. \u2047 We also saw a favorable sales mix. \u2047 In addition, we were able to pass through selective price increases to help cover merchandise cost increases from higher supply chain and input costs. \u2047 As expected, these improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs resulting from global supply chain disruptions and our prioritization of inventory availability over costs. \u2047 Compared to 2019, gross profit as a percent of net sales improved 886 basis points, driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 578 basis points due to fewer promotions, as well as leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 370 basis points, which again was partially offset by higher freight costs. \u2047 SG&A expenses were $631.9 million, or 23% of net sales, however, leveraged 151 basis points compared to last year due primarily to the increase in sales. \u2047 SG&A dollars increased $40.8 million, due primarily to current year cost increases to support the growth in sales. \u2047 In the prior year quarter, SG&A included $43 million of COVID-related costs. \u2047 However, in the current year, we transitioned our hourly teammates to compensation programs with a longer-term focus, including increasing and accelerating annual merit increases and higher wage minimums, partially offsetting"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 sales up 14% to $2.75 bln.  \u2047  compname reports record third quarter sales and earnings; delivers 12.2% increase in
