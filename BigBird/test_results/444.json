{"article": ["As usual, we'll start today's call with the CFO, who will review Vishay's second quarter 2021 financial results. \u2047 Dr. Gerald Paul will then give an overview of our business and discuss operational performance as well as segment results in more detail. \u2047 We use non-GAAP measures because we believe they provide useful information about the operating performance of our businesses and should be considered by investors in conjunction with GAAP measures that we also provide. \u2047 I will focus on some highlights and key metrics. \u2047 Vishay reported revenues for Q2 of $819 million, a quarterly record. \u2047 Our earnings per share was $0.64 for the quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $0.61 for the quarter. \u2047 The only reconciling items between GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share are tax related. \u2047 There were no reconciling items impacting gross or operating margins. \u2047 Revenues in the quarter were $819 million, up by 7.1% from previous quarter and up by 40.8% compared to prior year. \u2047 Gross margin was 28%. \u2047 Operating margin was 15.3% There were no reconciling items to arrive at adjusted operating margin. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $0.61. \u2047 EBITDA was $163 million or 19.9%. \u2047 There were no reconciling items to arrive at adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 Reconciling versus prior quarter, operating income quarter two 2021 compared to operating income for prior quarter based on $54 million higher sales or $55 million higher excluding exchange rate impacts, operating income increased by $28 million to $125 million in Q2 2021 from $97 million in Q1 2021. \u2047 The main elements were; average selling prices had a positive impact of $8 million, representing 1.0 ASP increase. \u2047 The volume increased with a positive impact of $22 million, equivalent to a 6.1% increase in volume. \u2047 Variable costs remained flat in total. \u2047 Cost reductions and volume related efficiencies offset increases in materials, services and metal prices. \u2047 Fixed costs remained flat in total, in line with our guidance. \u2047 Reconciling versus prior year, operating income quarter two 2021 compared to adjusted operating income in quarter two 2020 based on $237 million higher sales or $215 million excluding exchange rate impacts, adjusted operating income increased by $84 million to $125 million in Q2 2021 from $42 million in Q2 2020. \u2047 The main elements were: average selling prices had a negative impact of $2 million, representing a 0.3% ASP decline; volume increased with a positive impact of $101 million, representing a 36.4% increase. \u2047 Variable costs decreased with a positive impact of $6 million, primarily due to volume-related increased manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction efforts, which more than offset higher metal prices, annual wage increases and higher tariffs. \u2047 Fixed costs increased with a negative impact of $19 million, primarily due to annual wage increases and higher incentive compensation partially offset by our restructuring programs. \u2047 Inventory impacts had a positive impact of $5 million, exchange rates had a negative impact of $6 million. \u2047 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $104 million, in line with expectations. \u2047 For quarter three 2021, our expectations are approximately $104 million of SG&A expenses. \u2047 For the full year, our expectations are approximately $420 million at the exchange rates of quarter two. \u2047 The debt shown on the face of the balance sheet at quarter end is comprised of the convertible notes due 2025 net of debt issuance costs. \u2047 There were no amounts outstanding on a revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter. \u2047 However, we did use the revolver from time to time during Q2 to meet short-term financing needs and expect to continue to do so in the future. \u2047 No principal payments are due until 2025 and the revolving credit facility expires in June 2024. \u2047 We had total liquidity of $1.6 billion at quarter end. \u2047 Cash and short-term investments comprised $856 million and there were no amounts outstanding on our $750 million credit facility. \u2047 Total shares outstanding at quarter end were 145 million. \u2047 The expected share count for earnings per share purposes for the third quarter 2021 is approximately 145.5 million. \u2047 Our convertible debt repurchase activity over the past three years, together with the adoption of the new convertible debt standard, significantly reduces the variability of our earnings per share share count. \u2047 Our US GAAP tax rate year-to-date was approximately 19%, which mathematically yields a rate of 20% for Q2. \u2047 We recorded benefits of $3.9 million for the quarter and $8.3 million year-to-date due to changes in tax regulations. \u2047 Our normalized effective tax rate, which excludes the unusual tax items, was approximately 24% for the quarter and 23% for the year-to-date periods. \u2047 We expect our normalized effective tax rate for the full year 2021 to be between 22% and 24%. \u2047 Our consolidated effective tax rate is based on an assumed level and mix of income among our various taxing jurisdictions as shift in income could result in significantly different results. \u2047 Also, a significant change in US tax laws or regulations could result in significantly different results. \u2047 Cash from operations for the quarter was $117 million. \u2047 Capital expenditures for the quarter were $32 million. \u2047 Free cash for the quarter was $85 million. \u2047 For the trailing 12 months, cash from operations was $365 million. \u2047 Capital expenditures were $135 million, split approximately for expansion $86 million, for cost reduction $9 million, for maintenance of business $40 million. \u2047 Free cash generation for the trailing 12-month period was $230 million. \u2047 The trailing 12-month period includes $30 million in cash taxes paid for both the 2020 and 2021 installment of the US Tax Reform Transition Tax. \u2047 The 2020 installment was paid in Q3 2020, whereas the 2021 installment was paid in Q2. \u2047 Vishay has consistently generated in excess of $100 million in cash flows from operations in each of the past 26 years and greater than $200 million for the past 19 years. \u2047 Backlog at the end of Q2 was $2.050 billion or 7.5 months of sales. \u2047 Inventories increased quarter-over-quarter by $31 million, excluding the exchange rate impacts. \u2047 Days of inventory outstanding were 76 days. \u2047 Days of sales outstanding for the quarter are 43 days. \u2047 Days payables outstanding for the quarter were 33 days, resulting in a cash conversion cycle of 86 days. \u2047 Also in the second quarter, the steep upturn of our business visible since October of last year continued. \u2047 We keep ramping up critical manufacturing capacities, increasing revenues and profits further. \u2047 Quite excellent plant efficiencies, the impact of price increases and our traditional discipline in fixed cost support the financial results. \u2047 Vishay in the second quarter achieved a gross margin of 28% of sales and operating margin of 15.3% of sales, earnings per share of $1.64 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61. \u2047 We, in the second quarter, generated $85 million of free cash and we do expect another solid year of cash generation. \u2047 The economic environment for the electronics business continues to be exceptional with sales and backlogs at a historical high. \u2047 Virtually all markets are currently in excellent shape and supply chains continue to be rather depleted. \u2047 Despite all efforts to expand manufacturing capacities quickly, lead times for many product lines have stretched out rapidly and massively. \u2047 Price pressure presently is very low and selected price increases are being implemented, partially required to offset increased costs for metals and transportation. \u2047 Commenting on the regions. \u2047 We see continued strong performance in Asia and in the Americas. \u2047 Europe is somewhat lagging due to temporary supply problems in the automotive sector caused by a lack of ICs. \u2047 The Industrial segment drives demand in all the regions. \u2047 Distribution in all hemispheres continues to be extremely hungry for product. \u2047 Talking about distribution, global distribution continues to get overwhelmed with orders. \u2047 We see a record high since at least 15 years. \u2047 POS in the second quarter was 5% over prior quarter and a remarkable 45% over prior year. \u2047 After massive increases in the first quarter, POS increased further in all regions; by 3% in the Americas, by 6% in Asia and by 5% in Europe. \u2047 Global distribution inventory has stabilized on very low partially critically low levels. \u2047 Inventory turns of global distribution increased to quite extreme 4.4 from 4.3 in prior quarter; in the Americas, 2.1 after 1.9 in Q1 and 1.4 in prior year; in Asia, 7.4 turns after 6.7 in Q1 and 4.1 in prior year; 4.6 turns in Europe after 4.4 in Q1 and 3.0 in prior year. \u2047 Talking about the various industry segments we serve. \u2047 Automotive continues strong globally with OEMs continuing to struggle for replenishing vehicle inventory. \u2047 The increase of electronic content clearly accelerates. \u2047 There are some temporary supply programs leading to some artificial slowdown of the industry. \u2047 Still expect previously forecasted growth of 10% versus prior year in terms of vehicles. \u2047 We see an exceptional growth of the industrial sectors, which indicates an ongoing broad global upturn. \u2047 Factory automation and accelerated residential development, governmental investments in power generation and transmission systems as well as alternative energy systems are driving the demand. \u2047 Markets for computer and peripherals equipment are holding up well. \u2047 5G base station equipment continues to show promising growth in telecom. \u2047 Military spending continues reasonably strong commercial aerospace showing first signs of recovery. \u2047 The medical sector stabilized on a high level and consumer market sectors continued to show growth, driven by high rates of home construction, traditional television and gaming. \u2047 Coming to the business development for Vishay. \u2047 Due to high orders and backlogs and based on the continued increase of manufacturing capacities, Q2 sales excluding exchange rate impacts came in at a record and above the midpoint of our guidance. \u2047 We achieved sales of $819 million versus $765 million in prior quarter and $582 million in prior year. \u2047 Excluding exchange rate effects, sales in Q2 were up by $55 million or by 7% versus prior quarter and up by $215 million or 36% versus prior year. \u2047 Book-to-bill in the second quarter remained on a very high level of 1.38 after 1.67 in prior quarter, 1.41 for distribution after 1.89 in quarter one, 1.34 for OEMs after 1.41, 1.41 for semiconductors after 1.86 in Q1, 1.35 for passives after 1.50 in quarter one, 1.33 for the Americas after 1.42 in the first quarter, 1.29 for Asia after 1.86 in Q1, 1.54 for Europe after 1.62 in Q1. \u2047 Backlog in the second quarter climbed to another record high of 7.5 months after 6.8 months in Q1, 8.4 months in semis after 7.7 months in quarter one and 6.7 months in passives after 5.9 months last quarter. \u2047 There's practically no price decline, in fact there are some increases quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Vis-a-vis prior quarter, we saw a price increase of 1% and versus prior year a slight loss of 0.3%. \u2047 In semis, these numbers were an increase of 1.5% versus prior quarter and a slight decrease of 0.7% versus prior year. \u2047 For passives, price increases plus 0.4% versus prior quarter and plus 0.1% versus prior year. \u2047 Some highlights of operations. \u2047 SG&A costs in the second quarter came in at $104 million according to expectations when excluding exchange rate effects. \u2047 Manufacturing fixed costs in the second quarter came in at $141 million and according to expectation without ex tax rate effects. \u2047 Total employment at the end of the second quarter was 22,500, 2% up from prior quarter at 22,060. \u2047 Excluding exchange rate impacts, inventories in the quarter increased by $31 million, $11 million in raw materials and $20 million in way-in-process and finished goods. \u2047 Inventory turns in the second quarter remained at a very high level of 4.8. \u2047 Capital spending in Q2 was $32 million versus $25 million in prior year, $20 million for expansion, $2 million for cost reduction and $10 million for the maintenance of business. \u2047 In view of the extremely high market demand, we are accelerating mid-term expansion programs noticeably. \u2047 We now expect for the year '21 capex of approximately $250 million. \u2047 We generated in the second quarter cash from operations of $365 million on a trailing 12-month basis. \u2047 We generated in the second quarter free cash of $230 million, again on a trailing 12-month basis. \u2047 Despite increased capex, we also for the current year expect a solid generation of free cash, quite in line with our tradition. \u2047 Let me come to our product lines and I start as always with resistors. \u2047 With resistors, we enjoy a very strong position in the auto, industrial, military and medical market segments. \u2047 We offer virtually all resistor technologies and are globally known as a reliable and high quality supplier of the broadest product range. \u2047 Vishay's traditional and historically growing business has recovered completely from the pandemic running at record levels now. \u2047 Sales in the quarter were $195 million, up by $8 million or 4% versus prior quarter and up by $47 million or 32% versus prior year, all excluding exchange rate impacts. \u2047 Book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter continued strong at 1.39 after 1.50 in prior quarter. \u2047 Backlog increased further to 6.6 months from 5.6 months in prior quarter. \u2047 Due to higher volume and quite excellent efficiencies in the plants, gross margin in the second quarter increased further to 30% of sales from 29% in prior quarter. \u2047 Inventory turns in the quarter remained at a very high level of 5.1. \u2047 Selling prices are increasing plus 0.5% versus prior quarter and plus 0.6% versus prior year. \u2047 We are in process to raise critical manufacturing capacities for resistor chips and for power wirebond substantially, opening also a new production site in China. \u2047 And we do expect a very successful year for resistors. \u2047 This business consists of power inductors and magnetics. \u2047 Since years, this is our fastest growing business we have in passives and represents one of the greater success stories of Vishay. \u2047 Exploiting the growing need for inductors in general, Vishay developed a platform of robust and efficient power inductors and leads the market"], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.61.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.64.  \u2047  q2 revenue $819 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of
