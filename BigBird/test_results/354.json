{"article": ["Joining us today are: Brian Chambers, Owens Corning's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Parks, our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Refer to the Investors link under the Corporate section of our homepage. \u2047 Please reference slide 2 before we begin, where we offer a couple of reminders. \u2047 We undertake no obligation to update these statements beyond what is required under applicable securities laws. \u2047 I hope all of you on the call are staying healthy and safe. \u2047 Over the past year, I'm pleased to say that our team has consistently risen to the challenges that fundamentally impacted not only our businesses and markets, but the ways we work and live. \u2047 While many of those challenges continue to affect our daily lives, they are no longer unprecedented. \u2047 We've learned to be more agile to adapt and respond to changing market condition, demonstrating that strong execution and an uncompromising commitment to our people and our customers can drive exceptional performance even against this backdrop. \u2047 We certainly demonstrated this in the first quarter, delivering great operational and financial results by leveraging our market leading positions, unique product and process technologies and enterprise operating model to capitalize on strong or improving market conditions. \u2047 , before turning it over to Ken, who will provide additional details on our financial performance. \u2047 I will then come back to talk about our business outlook for the second quarter and share our perspective on key markets. \u2047 As always, I will begin my review at safety, where our collective focus remains working together to keep each other, our customers and our suppliers, healthy and safe. \u2047 During the first quarter, we maintained a very safe environment with an RIR of 0.64, which is in line with our full year 2020 performance. \u2047 More than half of our facilities across the globe have remained injury-free for more than a year. \u2047 Financially, we delivered record first quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 20% compared with the first quarter of 2020, up 18% on a constant currency basis; and adjusted EBIT of $282 million, which is more than double what we reported for the same period last year and a record for any first quarter historically. \u2047 Our global teams continue to execute well, delivering outstanding financial results in a dynamic market environment, demonstrating the earnings power of our company. \u2047 Our performance during the quarter was driven by good volumes, broad price realization and strong manufacturing efficiencies across all our businesses, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin for the company of 15%, with all three of our businesses posting double-digit EBIT margins for the third consecutive quarter. \u2047 During the quarter, we saw broad strength across many of our end markets. \u2047 Specifically, the US residential housing market continues to run at a robust pace, with both repair and remodeling activity and new construction growth driving strong demand for our products. \u2047 In addition, we continue to see many of our global markets as well as our commercial and industrial end markets improved throughout the quarter. \u2047 While market conditions have certainly turned more favorable, our operating priorities, investments and execution have positioned us to deliver these strong financial results. \u2047 Across the enterprise, we continue to invest in select growth and productivity initiatives to service our customers and improve our operating performance. \u2047 Within Insulation, we are investing in automation and process technologies to create a lower cost, more flexible manufacturing network in our residential insulation business as we commercially position ourselves to benefit from a strong housing market. \u2047 In addition, we continue to invest in new Insulation materials and systems in nonresidential applications to expand our global product offering. \u2047 In our Composites business, we are investing to grow in higher-value downstream applications, such as building and construction, wind energy and infrastructure. \u2047 And we remain focused on optimizing our low-cost manufacturing network to service key markets such as North America, Europe and India. \u2047 And in roofing, we continue to leverage our vertical integration model to develop innovative products and systems, while expanding our roofing components offering and strengthening our partnerships with contractors and distributors, to help grow their businesses with our products and brands. \u2047 All of this work is enabled by our enterprise operating model, which leverages our commercial strength, material science capabilities and global operating scale, to expand our growth opportunities, improve our operating efficiencies and generate strong free cash flow. \u2047 On the talent front, we recently announced the appointment of two great executives. \u2047 First, I'd like to congratulate Dr. Jose Mendez Andino on his recent promotion to Chief Research and Development Officer. \u2047 Material science research and product and process innovation are fundamental to what we do and how we deliver value as a company. \u2047 Jose will play a key role in leading our efforts to increase our innovation pipeline and ensure we are helping our customers win and grow in the market. \u2047 She joins us from Nordson Corporation where she served for 8 years, most recently as their General Counsel. \u2047 Gina brings more than two decades of experience working across multiple industries and will be a valuable partner to both me and our entire executive team. \u2047 Another highlight I would like to share is the recent publication of our 15th annual sustainability report titled, Beyond Today Shaping Tomorrow. \u2047 We began our sustainability journey nearly 2 decades ago. \u2047 And over the years, our goals have evolved and expanded well beyond environmental sustainability. \u2047 Today, they are built on three key pillars: expanding the positive impact of our products, reducing our environmental footprint and increasing our social impact. \u2047 We are proud of our progress and our accomplishments over the past decade across all of our 2020 sustainability goals, particularly our progress on climate action, where we have reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 60% since our peak year despite adding several material acquisitions along the way. \u2047 In our recently published 2030 goals, we are committed to further reduce these emissions by another 50%. \u2047 This will result in 2030 absolute greenhouse gas emissions being 75% below our peak. \u2047 At the same time, we are also committed to a 30% reduction in our scope 3 emissions as we focus on making a positive impact throughout our supply chain. \u2047 Sustainability is core to our purpose and will continue to be an important driver and differentiator for our company moving forward. \u2047 As Brian commented, Owens Corning delivered outstanding financial results in the first quarter. \u2047 Strong top line growth, 400 basis points of gross margin expansion and continued operating expense discipline drove record first quarter adjusted EBIT, along with an adjusted EBIT margin of 15%. \u2047 The stronger earnings, combined with a continued focus on working capital management and capital investments, resulted in healthy free cash flow generation in the quarter. \u2047 While benefiting from market conditions that are broadly stronger than they were a year ago, continued solid execution across the business was fundamental to driving this performance. \u2047 As anticipated, we're managing a more inflationary environment, primarily related to materials and transportation. \u2047 Positive price realization and manufacturing productivity more than offset the inflation headwind in the quarter. \u2047 Maintaining this positive balance remains a focus as we move through this inflationary environment. \u2047 Now turning to slide 5. \u2047 We can take a closer look at our results. \u2047 For the first quarter, we reported consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion, up 20% over 2020 with double-digit revenue growth in all 3 segments, reflecting the robust US residential housing market and the continued strengthening of commercial and industrial markets. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT for the first quarter of 2021 reached $282 million, up $166 million compared to the prior year and was highlighted by all 3 segments continuing to deliver double-digit EBIT margins. \u2047 Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $183 million or $1.73 per diluted share compared to $67 million or $0.62 per diluted share in Q1 2020. \u2047 Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $119 million, up slightly compared to the prior year. \u2047 Our capital additions for the first quarter were $60 million, up $6 million as compared to Q1 2020. \u2047 We'll continue to be disciplined in our capital spending as we focus on delivering strong free cash flow and prioritizing investments that drive growth and productivity. \u2047 Slide 6 reconciles our first quarter adjusted EBIT of $282 million to our reported EBIT of $301 million. \u2047 During the quarter, we recognized $20 million of gains on the sale of certain precious metals. \u2047 Ongoing progress on our productivity initiatives and manufacturing process technology has enabled us to further modify the designs of our production tooling and reduce certain precious metal holdings. \u2047 In addition, we recorded $1 million of restructuring costs associated with the Insulation network optimization actions that we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 These items are excluded from our adjusted first quarter EBIT. \u2047 Slide 7 provides a high-level overview of our first quarter adjusted EBIT comparing 2021 to 2020. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT of $282 million was a new first quarter record for the company and increased $166 million over the prior year. \u2047 Roofing and Insulation more than doubled their EBIT and Composites grew by 80%. \u2047 Before turning to the review of each of our businesses, I want to speak to the onetime financial impacts we had from the winter storms in February. \u2047 Each of our businesses faced operational disruptions related to the storms. \u2047 However, these were offset in each of the businesses by gains on renewable energy settlements. \u2047 As we discussed at the time of our year-end call, these impacts were contemplated in our first quarter guidance. \u2047 Now, turning to Slide 8. \u2047 I'll provide more details on the performance of each of the businesses. \u2047 The Insulation business executed well to deliver strong growth on both the top and bottom lines. \u2047 Sales for the quarter were $700 million, a 16% increase over first quarter 2020. \u2047 We saw volume strength across the business as US new construction continued to be robust, and many of the commercial end markets we serve globally continue to strengthen. \u2047 In North American residential Fiberglas Insulation, we continue to ship all we can produce as the US new residential market remains very healthy. \u2047 We saw volumes up in line with the expectations we had at the time of our last call and continue to see positive pricing as a result of the actions that we've taken over the past three quarters. \u2047 I'm happy to share that we started up our batts and rolls lines in Kansas City in February and continued to ramp up production as we move through the quarter. \u2047 In technical and other insulation, we saw volume up across the business with our highly specified products, continuing to see growth in demand in North America and Europe. \u2047 Pricing continues to be stable, and we saw a benefit from currency translation in the quarter. \u2047 For the Insulation business overall, good execution in our manufacturing operations partially offset continued transportation headwinds and accelerating material inflation. \u2047 We delivered margins of 12% and EBIT of $82 million more than double the $39 million of EBIT in the first quarter of last year. \u2047 The Composites business had a strong start to the year. \u2047 Sales for the first quarter were $559 million, up 13% compared to the prior year. \u2047 Stronger-than-expected volume growth in the quarter resulted from demand for downstream applications serving the building and construction and wind markets as well as demand in key geographies where our local supply for local demand model is being valued by customers and drove higher volumes compared to the prior year. \u2047 We also saw positive price realization in Composites, resulting from our most recent contract negotiations and the strength of the markets. \u2047 Operationally, solid manufacturing performance offset headwinds from material and transportation inflation. \u2047 For the quarter, Composites delivered $79 million of EBIT and EBIT margin of 14%. \u2047 Slide 10 provides an overview of our Roofing business. \u2047 The Roofing business produced its strongest first quarter top and bottom line performance as we continue to operate in a sold-out environment. \u2047 Sales in the first quarter were $711 million, up 28% compared to the prior year. \u2047 The US asphalt shingle market grew 26% for the quarter as compared to the prior year with our US shingle volumes, slightly outperforming the market. \u2047 We're seeing strong realization on our announced price increases and price costs remained positive as asphalt deflation continued to narrow through the quarter, and we started to face into transportation inflation. \u2047 Similar to the other 2 businesses, strong manufacturing performance was a fundamental element of the Roofing business results. \u2047 For the quarter, EBIT was $156 million, up $92 million from the prior year, achieving 22% EBIT margins. \u2047 Turning to Slide 11. \u2047 I'll discuss significant financial highlights for the first quarter and full year 2021, continued discipline around management of working capital, operating expenses and capital investments resulted in strong cash flow. \u2047 In addition, we didn't experience the seasonal working capital build that we typically see in the first quarter of the year due to robust demand across our businesses. \u2047 Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2021 at $120 million, up $264 million compared to the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 It was a record for a first quarter. \u2047 During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock and returned $197 million of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. \u2047 With the strong cash performance and last year's deleveraging activities, we maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet and are operating within our target debt to adjusted EBITDA range with ample liquidity. \u2047 At quarter end, the company had liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of $605 million of cash and nearly $1.1 billion of combined availability on our bank debt facilities. \u2047 We remain focused on consistently generating strong free cash flow, returning at least 50% to investors over time and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. \u2047 Now, turning to 2021 outlook for key financial items. \u2047 I'll point out that there are no changes from our initial outlook provided in February. \u2047 General corporate expenses are expected to range between $135 million and $145 million. \u2047 Capital additions are expected to be approximately $460 million, which is below expected depreciation and amortization of approximately $480 million. \u2047 We continue to focus on opportunities to support our businesses at a sustained lower level of capital intensity over time. \u2047 Interest expense is estimated to be between $120 million and $130 million. \u2047 And we expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be 26% to 28% of adjusted pre-tax earnings and our cash tax rate to be 18% to 20% of adjusted pre-tax earnings. \u2047 We're closely monitoring potential changes to the US tax landscape and will be proactive to mitigate the long-term effect on our cash tax rate. \u2047 Our first quarter performance provided a strong start to the year. \u2047 As we look forward, we expect the US residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets to remain robust with our commercial and industrial markets continuing to strengthen. \u2047 While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create market uncertainty"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.73.  \u2047  q1 adjusted earnings per share $1.73.  \u2047  qtrly consolidated net sales of $1.9 billion, an
