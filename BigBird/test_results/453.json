{"article": ["And while we believe our assumptions are reasonable, there are a variety of reasons actual results may differ materially from those projected. \u2047 I'm -- as is our custom, we will go through market conditions here in the islands. \u2047 If you look at the unemployment slide here, you see that the economy here in the islands is steadily improving, are really being driven by a nice improvement or regaining traction in the visitor industry, as well as improvement in what we call the local economy. \u2047 UHERO's economic pulse indicator, which is a high frequency aggregation of numerous data points, has basically the local economy now at 72% versus pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 A quarter ago, I think we reported 62% to you, so sized[Phonetic] improvement there. \u2047 And you see all of this relating into better unemployment rates. \u2047 Unemployment now is down to 7.7%, the fifth consecutive month of declines. \u2047 The real estate market here in the islands like many markets is very strong. \u2047 Oahu's single-family homes were up; in terms of sales, 49% June versus June a year ago. \u2047 Sales price -- median sales prices were up 27%, and inventories are very constrained. \u2047 So median days on market are down 60% from a year ago to eight days and months of inventory is down 52% from a year ago to 1.2 months of inventory. \u2047 The condominium sector here on Oahu, similar story, a little bit more muted though, but sales up 134% June on June. \u2047 Median sales price is up 9% and inventory conditions very similar to the single-family home market. \u2047 So a very strong real estate sector here on Oahu and generally, throughout the Hawaiian Islands. \u2047 The visitor industry, as I mentioned, is doing quite nicely. \u2047 So you see this chart here really since the relaunch of our -- or the launch of our Safe Travels program, visitor arrivals have increased substantively, basically now approaching pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Airlift is a great story in June. \u2047 Actually, we had 1,027,000 seats into the islands, which is a 14.3% increase from June of 2019, and July and August forecasts are even more robust than that. \u2047 So the airlines are doing their jobs. \u2047 Arrivals are looking good. \u2047 The most recent data we have from the Hawaii Tourism Authority has arrivals at 74% of 2019 levels, so pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Visitor days at 83%, pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 And expenditures at just under 80% of 2019 levels. \u2047 And we have reason to believe that the balance of the summer, June, July and August should eclipse those numbers as well. \u2047 Hotels are doing quite nicely. \u2047 As of June, we're back up to about 97% of our room stock back in service. \u2047 Occupancies are running at 77% statewide versus 84% pre-pandemic in 2019. \u2047 Average daily rates were very robust at $320 for June versus $280 for the same month in 2019. \u2047 So, if you can believe it, RevPAR, or revenue per available room, is actually higher as of June of this year than it was in June of 2019 at $246 per available room versus $235 per available room June of 2019. \u2047 So, very strong performance in the hotel sector. \u2047 And forward bookings, just talking to a number of professionals in the industry, seems to be very strong as things stand right now. \u2047 The COVID condition here in the islands is reasonably good. \u2047 Rolling seven day averages have us in the top half of the country. \u2047 Although we are concerned like most other marketplaces over the emergence of the Delta variant. \u2047 And vaccinations, for the most part, have gone well. \u2047 So, we're in the 36 percentile of the country and hopefully -- obviously like most marketplace, we would love to get that number higher. \u2047 So, that's a synopsis of the marketplace. \u2047 Growth from core customers remained solid in the second quarter. \u2047 Core loans net of PPP waivers increased by $113 million, or 1%, in the quarter and by $250 million year-over-year. \u2047 Waivers on PPP loans have accelerated and resulted in a net decline of $212 million in the quarter. \u2047 Our strong deposit growth continued, increasing $613 million, or 3.1%, linked quarter and $2.7 billion, or 16%, year-over-year. \u2047 With the loan to deposit ratio of 60%, our strong deposit base remains a stable source of liquidity. \u2047 Together with our healthy cash balance of $910 million at the end of the quarter, we maintain significant flexibility for further loan and investment growth, and we continue to deploy liquidity to support net interest income as well as mitigate the impact of near-term rate pressures. \u2047 Consistent with this strategy, we added $1 billion of liquid and safe investments to the portfolio, increasing total balances to $8.5 billion. \u2047 Net income for the second quarter was $67.5 million, or $1.68 per common share, up from $59.9 million in the first quarter and $38.9 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Net interest income in the second quarter was $123.5 million, up from $120.6 million in the first quarter and down from $126.7 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Included in the second and first quarters' net interest income were $3.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of accelerated loan fees from PPP loan waivers. \u2047 Included in the second quarter of 2020 net interest income was an interest recovery of $2.9 million. \u2047 Adjusting for PPP loan forgiveness, net interest income was slightly higher than the first quarter as the impact from lower interest rates was offset by the deployment of liquidity. \u2047 As Mary will discuss later. \u2047 we recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $16.1 million this quarter. \u2047 Noninterest income totaled $44.4 million in the second quarter, up from $43 million in the first quarter and down from $51.3 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Included in the second quarter were gains of $3.7 million from the sale of investment securities. \u2047 Included in the second quarter of 2020 was a gain of $14.2 million from the sale of our remaining Visa shares. \u2047 Adjusting for these changes, the decrease from the first quarter was due to lower mortgage banking income, primarily from the impact of rate volatility on MSR valuations. \u2047 In the second quarter, we recorded an MSR impairment of $1.1 million versus a recovery of $2.2 million in the first quarter. \u2047 Adjusting for the MSR valuations, mortgage banking income was up about $400,000 quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Partially offsetting the MSR valuation impairment or higher service charges and other transaction fees, the increase from the second quarter of 2020 was mainly due to an increase of $5.4 million from fees on deposit accounts and other service charges due to the reopening of the economy. \u2047 We expect noninterest income will be approximately $42 million to $43 million per quarter for the remainder of the year from the increasing deposit fees, service charges and other transaction fees from the improving economy. \u2047 Noninterest expense in the second quarter totaled $96.5 million. \u2047 The second quarter's expenses included charges of $3.2 million related to the early termination of repurchase agreements and term debt and a $3.1 million benefit from the sale of property. \u2047 The termination of the repos and term debt allowed us to reduce our non-core funding, reposition some securities at a net gain and increase our net interest income. \u2047 With the improving economic provisioning and earnings outlook for 2021, accruals for corporate incentive compensation are back to pre-pandemic levels and were $3.2 million higher than the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 In the second quarter of 2021, we also experienced higher levels of variable expenses from rising production, as well as continuing investments in innovation initiatives. \u2047 The remaining core expenses were nearly flat with expenses from the second quarter of 2020 and overall expenses continued to be managed in a disciplined manner. \u2047 Excluding one-time items, our normalized full year noninterest expense projection, including restoration of corporate incentives, remains approximately $385 million, with the third and fourth quarter expenses being approximately the same as the second quarter at $96 million to $97 million. \u2047 The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.84%. \u2047 Currently, we expect the effective tax rate for 2021 will be approximately 24%, driven by higher pre-tax income. \u2047 Our return on assets during the first quarter was 1.23%. \u2047 The return on common equity was 19.6%. \u2047 And our efficiency ratio was 57.47%. \u2047 Our net interest margin in the second quarter was 2.37%, a decline of 6 basis points from the first quarter. \u2047 The decline in the margin in the second quarter reflects the ongoing impact from the strong deposit growth and lower rates, partially offset by deployment of liquidity. \u2047 We expect the margin will decline approximately 5 basis points to 6 basis points in the third quarter, primarily due to the continued deposit growth and the recent decrease in long-term rates, then stabilize in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Net interest income in the third quarter will be approximately flat to slightly higher than the second quarter. \u2047 The increase in NII is expected from continued balance sheet growth, deployment of excess liquidity and stable interest rates, but we remain asset sensitive and are well positioned for higher rates. \u2047 These estimates exclude the impact of PPP loan prepayments, which have been volatile and unpredictable. \u2047 We strengthened our capital levels through our very successful issuance of $180 million in preferred stock. \u2047 The addition of preferred capital together with our strong earnings increased our Tier 1 capital and leverage ratios to 13.9% and 7.31%, respectively, adding to our excess levels. \u2047 We are well positioned for continued growth over and above the strong deposit growth of $4.4 billion we've already absorbed into our balance sheet since the beginning of 2020. \u2047 During the second quarter, we paid out $27 million, or 40%, of net income in dividends. \u2047 Our strong capital levels and income generation will enable us to restart the share repurchase program this month, which has been suspended since the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 The remaining share buyback authority is $113 million. \u2047 And finally, consistent with our improving income levels, our Board declared a dividend of $0.70 per common share for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $0.03 per share. \u2047 At the end of the quarter, customer loan balances on deferral were down 88% from their peak to 1.8% of total loans. \u2047 You'll recall, given we had the capacity to do so, we elected to partner with our customers through this unprecedented event and provided extended relief primarily through principal deferrals on low margin real estate. \u2047 Accordingly, 93% of loans remaining under deferral are secured, with our consumer residential deferrals having a weighted average loan-to-value of 68%, and our commercial deferrals having a weighted average loan-to-value of 46% with 97% continuing to pay interest. \u2047 Return to payment performance previously deferred loans has continued to be strong with less than 1% of these customers delinquent 30 days or more at the end of the quarter. \u2047 Credit metrics remained strong and stable in the quarter. \u2047 Net charge-offs were $1.2 million as compared with net charge-offs of $2.9 million in the first quarter and net charge-offs of $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Non-performing assets totaled $19 million, up $1.1 million for the linked period and down $3.7 million year-over-year. \u2047 Loans delinquent 30 days or more were $29.8 million or 25 basis points of total loans at quarter-end, down $10.1 million for the linked period and up $6.3 million from the second quarter of last year. \u2047 Criticized exposure continued to decrease during the quarter, dropping from 2.6% of loans to 2.17% of total loans. \u2047 As Dean noted, we recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $16.1 million. \u2047 This included a negative provision to the allowance for credit losses of $16.8 million, which with net charge-offs of $1.2 million reduced the allowance to $180.4 million, representing 1.5% of total loans and leases or 1.56% net of PPP balances. \u2047 The decrease in the allowance is reflective of the most recent UHERO economic outlook and forecast for our market, coupled with our credit risk profile. \u2047 The allowance does continue to consider and provide for the potential downside risk inherent with the pandemic. \u2047 The reserve for unfunded credit commitments was $4.5 million at the end of the quarter with a provision of $1.5 million made to fund the linked-period increase. \u2047 We are now happy to answer any questions you may have. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q2 earnings per share $1.68.  \u2047  oration second quarter 2021 financial results.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $1.68."], "pred_summary":
