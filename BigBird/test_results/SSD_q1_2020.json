{"article": ["As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ materially from those implied by our comments today. \u2047 Since our last earnings call, we have made outstanding progress on multiple fronts. \u2047 I'll highlight just four. \u2047 First, we increased our total liquidity and decreased our total debt through a successful preferred equity offering. \u2047 Second, we reduced our monthly burn rate, significantly beating our prior expectations. \u2047 Third, we reopened five additional hotels. \u2047 And fourth, we struck a sweeping deal with Marriott that not only increased the NAV of our portfolio by $50 million but distinguishes DiamondRock's portfolio as the least encumbered by long-term management agreements among all full service public lodging REITs. \u2047 Now, while we have made good progress and remain optimistic about the future of travel, the pandemic we are living through has obviously created tremendous dislocation in near-term demand. \u2047 In the third quarter, there were some encouraging early signs of a recovery in travel demand. \u2047 The relative bright spot has been in leisure travel, which of course is elective travel. \u2047 Guests have been checking into the drive-to resorts DiamondRock is known for. \u2047 In contrast, business travel and group business demand has only marginally improved and is likely to remain very constrained until there is a healthcare solution such as a vaccine, effective therapy or a massive national testing program. \u2047 Interestingly, we are seeing signs of pent-up demand. \u2047 So, we believe there is a chance for a meaningful snap back on the other side of the healthcare solution. \u2047 Personally, this is my fourth downturn, and we know how to manage through these environments. \u2047 That experience is why DiamondRock has always embraced a low-leverage and conservative balance sheet strategy. \u2047 We currently have more than enough liquidity to carry the Company until such time as we are cash flow positive once again. \u2047 History shows that travel demand always eventually surpasses the peak of the prior cycle, and we remain optimistic that this recovery ultimately will be no different. \u2047 But make no mistake, this is the most difficult operating environment of modern times and requires almost herculean efforts to ensure guest and employee safety first, while trying to preserve cash flow. \u2047 Although the environment required significant reductions in staffing, we were able to soften the blow to hotel associates with nearly $8 million in severance paid out this year. \u2047 Rest assured that we are doing everything possible to be responsible fiduciaries and community citizens while making certain that DiamondRock is set up for future success. \u2047 Let's turn specifically to DiamondRock's third quarter. \u2047 Hotel adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a $17.4 million loss, a marked improvement from the $30.4 million loss in the second quarter. \u2047 Corporate adjusted EBITDA was a $24.4 million loss as compared to a $37 million loss in the second quarter. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted FFO per share was a loss of $0.22 as compared to a loss of $0.20 in the second quarter. \u2047 Two items worth noting with these results: one, they exclude $7.4 million in onetime severance costs; and two, this one is important, adjusted FFO per share was negatively impacted by a non-cash income tax valuation allowance recognized in the quarter of $12.4 million or $0.06 per share. \u2047 In other words, our third quarter AFFO would have been a loss of only $0.16 per share without that tax adjustment. \u2047 Moreover, in the quarter, we successfully reopened five more hotels and had nearly 90% of our rooms available to sell at the end of the third quarter. \u2047 To illustrate the progress, that 90% figure compares to just 58% at the end of the second quarter. \u2047 Furthermore, portfolio occupancy jumped over 1,000 basis points from the second quarter to 18.6%. \u2047 Recall that we ended the second quarter with just 22 hotels open and operating. \u2047 We opened a 23rd hotel, our Lodge at Sonoma Resort, on the first day of the third quarter. \u2047 Those 23 hotels saw occupancy rise from 26% in July to 28% in August, and finally, to 31% in September. \u2047 In July, we reopened two other hotels besides The Lodge at Sonoma that included Hilton Boston Downtown and the Hilton Burlington on Lake Champlain. \u2047 Our decision to reopen hotels has been and continues to be dynamic and data-driven. \u2047 We reopen hotels if we can lose less money doing so. \u2047 Based on this approach, the data led us to keep three of our New York City hotels closed but to reopen our two big box hotels, the Chicago Marriott and the Boston Waterfront Westin in early September. \u2047 Now, as you'd expect, nightly occupancy is comparatively lower at these two big box hotels than the balance of the portfolio. \u2047 But a resilient base of contract business and aggressive cost controls has thus far confirmed that reopening was the right decision. \u2047 For the entire portfolio, total revenue decreased 79% in the quarter as a result of an 81% decline in RevPAR, that was partially offset by a smaller decline in food and beverage revenue. \u2047 Total revenues were $50 million in the quarter as compared to just $20.4 million in the second quarter. \u2047 Over the summer, monthly revenues showed steady progress, rising from slightly over $11 million in June to over $14 million in July, to over $16 million in August, and finally, reaching almost $20 million in September. \u2047 Encouragingly, revenue in October looks to be coming in even a little bit better at over $22 million. \u2047 Okay, let's talk about profitability. \u2047 To maximize absolute profit, our asset managers are working closely with our operators to aggressively drive revenue while implementing strict expense controls. \u2047 In the third quarter, every department, rooms, F&B and other, saw material improvement in profitability as compared to Q2 with sequential acceleration in flow-through that surpassed internal forecast. \u2047 For example, the rooms department margin rose from 45% in the second quarter to 64% in the third quarter, driven in large part by a 25% sequential reduction in the cost per occupied room. \u2047 Over the course of the quarter, we saw the number of hotels achieving breakeven profitability continue to expand. \u2047 In June, we had 10 hotels generating positive gross operating profit, or GOP, and this figure rose to 18 hotels by the end of September. \u2047 Over that same period, GOP margin moved from a negative 35% to a positive 9% margin as a testament to our ability to drive revenue while constraining costs. \u2047 On an EBITDA basis, six hotels in June were operating profitably, and that figure rose to 10 hotels by September. \u2047 What you cannot see, however, is an additional 10 hotels were, on average, approximately $100,000 from breakeven EBITDA in September. \u2047 Here's one other additional data point I think you'll find interesting. \u2047 If we exclude the two big box hotels, the Chicago Marriott and the Westin Boston, from the 27 hotels we had open in September, the remaining 25 hotels collectively would have been within $200,000 of breakeven EBITDA. \u2047 Clearly, the portfolio is near a favorable tipping point for profitability, and much of the source of that strength is DiamondRock's drive-to resort portfolio. \u2047 Our resorts are performing very well and generated positive and growing EBITDA every month in the quarter. \u2047 Let me share with you a couple of highlights from just two of our resorts to give you an idea of the pockets of strength we are seeing. \u2047 The Landing in Lake Tahoe saw a 19% increase in RevPAR over the third quarter 2019 with an ADR of nearly $500 per night and total RevPAR approaching nearly $560 per night. \u2047 EBITDA margins at this hotel increased nearly 1,400 basis points as compared to the third quarter in 2019. \u2047 The L'Auberge de Sedona saw a 21% increase in RevPAR over the third quarter in 2019 with total RevPAR approaching nearly $675 per night. \u2047 Moreover, we are taking steps to ensure this success continues. \u2047 For example, subsequent to the quarter-end, we completed a new Michael Mina restaurant in Sonoma as part of the larger ROI up-branding of that resort from a Renaissance to an Autograph. \u2047 The restaurant opened strong, and in just the first month of operation, generated nearly $325,000 in revenue. \u2047 We also expect the restaurant to create a halo effect at that resort, which will allow us to increase room rates. \u2047 Another example of strength is likely to come from the almost complete renovation of the Barbary Beach House in Key West, which will be done before year-end. \u2047 This former Sheraton has been reimagined into a very special lifestyle boutique that is already getting rave reviews. \u2047 And we are optimistic about our ability to drive rate this winter season. \u2047 Switching gears, let's look at each of our segments of demand in the quarter. \u2047 Leisure is unquestionably the strongest performing segment in the portfolio. \u2047 The resort portfolio performance increased strongly and steadily over the quarter from 36% occupancy and $141 in total RevPAR in July to over 43% occupancy and nearly $191 in total RevPAR in September, a $50 per night jump. \u2047 For the third quarter, ADR at our resorts increased 2.2% as compared to last year with September showing good strength and up 5%. \u2047 The resilience of rate at our resorts tells us price is not a gating issue in making the travel decision. \u2047 This is an encouraging data point that the same people will ultimately be prepared to travel when their employers feel comfortable letting them get back on the road. \u2047 As for business transient, our current thinking is that we will not see a material change until there is an announcement of a vaccine or broad distribution of a therapy. \u2047 For our portfolio, business transient remained soft but it did improve. \u2047 In the 3rd quarter, business transient revenue and rooms more than doubled from their contribution in the second quarter. \u2047 In fact, business transient rooms were 23% of total rooms sold in the third quarter, up from only 19% in the second quarter. \u2047 Similarly, the group segment remains a relative soft spot. \u2047 Outside of social gatherings such as weddings, we continue to expect that large corporate group events will be the final segment to recover. \u2047 Nevertheless, there are some encouraging data points to share with you. \u2047 The first data point is that DiamondRock saw approximately 250,000 room nights of leads generated each month during the quarter, with most of the inquiries for 2021 and 2022. \u2047 Interestingly, RFP conversion ratios to awarded business are at near normal rates. \u2047 Also, sports teams are playing. \u2047 DiamondRock has arrangements with seven professional football and baseball teams, Several NCAA sports teams and even a PGA golf tournament. \u2047 Another good data point is that according to Cvent, September was the strongest month of RFP activity since March. \u2047 September volume is up 18% versus August, and October is on pace for a strong performance, too. \u2047 Cvent also reports that overall group rates are down approximately 5% to 10% in 2021 but up 5% to 10% in 2022. \u2047 Looking at 2021, rates are softer earlier in the year when uncertainty is the highest and quickly approach pre-pandemic levels by late 2021. \u2047 Group rate integrity in RFPs has been relatively more resilient in New York City, Boston and Chicago than it has been in San Francisco. \u2047 Again, an encouraging trend, given our geographic mix. \u2047 Before handing the call off to Jeff, I did want to touch on our capital investments. \u2047 We held capex spending to $8.6 million in the quarter, which is inclusive of approximately $0.5 million for Frenchman's Reef. \u2047 Outside of life safety projects or emergency repairs, our primary focus remains conserving capital. \u2047 However, we did prioritize projects that can produce a near-term earnings benefit and high return on investment. \u2047 These projects include the F&B repositioning initiatives at our hotels in Sonoma and Charleston, as well as completing the conversion renovation at the Barbary Beach Resort in Key West. \u2047 We expect these investments will be measurable earnings contributors in 2021, and the average IRR for these projects is expected to exceed 30%. \u2047 Before leaving capex, I did want to remind everyone that we have paused the reconstruction of Frenchman's Reef. \u2047 Our current plan is to look for a joint venture partner for this project over the next year before restarting construction in order to preserve our balance sheet capacity. \u2047 Let me start by talking about our liquidity. \u2047 We improved our liquidity in the quarter by nearly $71 million as a result of the successful preferred offering -- preferred equity offering. \u2047 At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $435 million of total liquidity, including corporate-level cash, hotel-level cash and undrawn revolver capacity. \u2047 I'm pleased to report, we are beating our original estimates for monthly cash burn rates, and we continue to make significant gains. \u2047 Before capex, our average monthly burn rate in the third quarter, pro forma for the preferred dividend, was $14.7 million. \u2047 Let me walk through the sources of the $2 million improvement. \u2047 The net operating loss at the corporate NOI level was $10 million per month in the quarter, as compared to our earlier estimate of $11.5 million, a $1.5 million per month improvement, owing, among other reasons, to improving top line, strict cost controls and the decision to reopen additional hotels. \u2047 Debt service was $4.1 million per month in the quarter, as compared to a prior estimate of $4.5 million. \u2047 The $3,000 to $4,000 per month savings is a result of forbearance that will reverse in the coming months. \u2047 The straight line capital expenditure budget in both cases is $3 million per month. \u2047 Including capex, our total Company burn rate was $17.7 million during the quarter and implies a cash runway through late 2022. \u2047 As Mark mentioned at the start of the call, we strongly believe that we have more than enough liquidity to carry us through to a point where we are cash flow positive, and that is why we took the step of issuing preferred equity last quarter so that we would not be pressured into a common equity offering in the future. \u2047 As it relates to the outlook for our burn rate, we are not providing specific guidance. \u2047 However, remember that Q4 and Q1 historically see weaker demand levels, and there is a risk that the recent increases in COVID cases throughout much of the US could lead to municipalities rolling back the operating guidelines that have allowed us to reopen. \u2047 While we will continue to do everything within our power to minimize loss and maximize profitability, I encourage you to consider that sequential revenue and profit growth could prove challenging"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted ffo loss per share $0.22.  \u2047  is not providing updated guidance at this time."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.22.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings
