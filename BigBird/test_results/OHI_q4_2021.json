{"article": ["We are happy to be with you as we turned the calendar to 2021, and I sincerely hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. \u2047 Joining me on the call today are company's CIO, Greg Zimmerman; and company's CFO, Mark Peterson. \u2047 For the overview, clearly, 2020 was a year unlike any other we've experienced since the company was founded in 1997. \u2047 Early in the onset of the pandemic, we recognized the need to fortify the company's balance sheet to maintain sufficient liquidity for the long term. \u2047 Key among early actions was to defer an anticipated gaming venue investment of approximately 1 billion, along with deferring other uncommitted investment spending of approximately 600 million. \u2047 Additionally, we accessed our unsecured credit facility as a precautionary measure and suspended our monthly dividend to common shareholders. \u2047 We determined that these actions were prudent due to the extremely challenging environment in which our tenants have been operating. \u2047 As we speak today, our liquidity remains in a strong position with cash on hand in excess of 500 million. \u2047 This large reserve of cash reflects the fact that we are to return to normalcy. \u2047 However, as we announced in our quarterly disclosure on January 7, we generated positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and anticipate this trend to continue. \u2047 The recent paydown of our credit facility balance reflects this positive momentum and demonstrates our increased confidence. \u2047 Throughout 2020, our team was focused on the many challenges brought on by the pandemic, including monitoring tenant performance, assisting in reopening plans and collaborating to develop plans that ensure long-term stability and success for both our tenants and EPR Properties. \u2047 We have seen the success of this strategy with our nontheater tenants, where approximately 94% are open and rent collections have improved materially. \u2047 While our properties are still impacted by locally mandated closures and capacity restraints, performance and customer demand continued to improve, which we believe demonstrates our final thesis of people's desire for experiences. \u2047 As Greg will discuss in more detail, our theater tenants are still primarily challenged with limited film product, which should subside as we progress through 2021. \u2047 However, early indications from around the world indicate that when product is available and flowing, there is robust consumer demand. \u2047 Overall, we are pleased with both the progress and trajectory of our recovery as it is reflected in a continued increase in cash collections as we entered 2021. \u2047 Throughout the year, we made continuous progress. \u2047 And as I've stated before, I'm very proud of how our team has responded to the substantial challenges that they have faced. \u2047 Looking ahead, as we look forward in 2021, we're encouraged by the accelerated rollout of vaccines. \u2047 will continue to be a phased process, yet we also believe that as a society, we are more than ready to return to a sense of normalcy. \u2047 We also continue to be encouraged by the resiliency displayed by many of our tenants and anticipate that theaters will follow a similar pattern when they open more widely and key titles are consistently released. \u2047 As the country begins the recovery process, we look forward to getting back on the path to growth. \u2047 This process requires continued improvement and stabilization of our cash collections, which will allow us to exit our existing debt covenant waivers. \u2047 Upon achieving that goal, our focus will turn to reinstituting our common dividend and reinitiating our investment spending program. \u2047 The timing of achieving these milestones will be entirely dependent on a number of variables, including an effective vaccine deployment. \u2047 However, as today's results indicate, our progress has measurably improved in the early months of 2021, and we are optimistic that our goals are achievable during the second half of 2021. \u2047 At the end of the first quarter, our total investments were approximately 6.5 billion with 356 properties in service and 94.2% occupied. \u2047 During the quarter, our investment spending was 22.8 million and was entirely in our experiential portfolio, comprising build-to-suit development and redevelopment projects that were committed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 For the year, our investment spending was 85.1 million. \u2047 Our experiential portfolio comprises 281 properties with 43 operators, is 93.8% occupied and accounts for 91% of our total investments or approximately 5.9 billion of the total 6.5 billion. \u2047 We have three properties under development. \u2047 Our education portfolio comprises 75 properties with 12 operators, and at the end of the quarter was 100% occupied. \u2047 As the vaccine rollout accelerates, people are looking for safe and easily accessible ways to get out of their homes and come back together with friends. \u2047 Our operators are working hard to offer entertainment experiences which create memories in safe environments. \u2047 We're seeing that as consumers become increasingly confident in safety measures and restrictions are reduced, they're returning to our properties. \u2047 Now I'll update you on the operating status of our tenants, our deferral agreements and our rent payment time lines. \u2047 60% of our theaters were open as of February 22nd. \u2047 As we have previously noted, Cineworld made the decision to close all of its U.S., U.K. and Ireland theaters because of the lack of tentpole films from Hollywood. \u2047 Today, none of our 57 Regal theaters are open. \u2047 Theaters continue to face significant headwinds from the lack of tentpole films and capacity and concessions restrictions implemented by state and local governments. \u2047 These challenges will slowly begin to abate during vaccination ramp up and with loosening restrictions throughout the country. \u2047 Based on the current vaccine -- vaccination cadence, we believe major film releases and box office will begin to accelerate in the second half of 2021. \u2047 The 2021 film slate was strong before the pandemic. \u2047 Because a number of films scheduled for 2020 pushed to 2021, we believe the projected film slate will provide a strong content cadence for theaters to ramp up as vaccinations increase, normalcy returns and consumers feel more and more comfortable returning to the movies. \u2047 2021 tentpoles currently scheduled for release beginning in May include Black Widow, the Fast & Furious 9, Top Gun: Maverick, Jungle Cruise, Death on the Nile, A Quiet Place Part II, Dune, No Time to Die, Ghostbusters: Afterlife and MI7. \u2047 Box office strength will continue into 2022 with Jurassic World: Dominion pushing to mid-'22. \u2047 As demonstrated by consumer behavior in Asia and the Hollywood release schedule, we do not see evidence of structural changes in theater going habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 In Asia, the consumer bounced back quickly. \u2047 China's box office continues to perform solidly even in weeks without products. \u2047 During the Lunar New Year holiday, Detective Chinatown three opened with the highest grossing opening day, $163 million and opening weekend, $398 million, in history outpacing Avengers: Endgame. \u2047 Over the Lunar New Year holiday, Detective Chinatown three and Hi, Mom each grossed over $620 million. \u2047 In January, Demon Slayer became Japan's highest grossing movie ever. \u2047 Further, as provided by the continued recovery and resilience of our other experiential tenants, which I'll discuss in a moment, customers still want to engage in entertaining, affordable out-of-home experiences. \u2047 Once they know the operator is open and become comfortable with new protocols, we see that they are returning to experiential assets. \u2047 We are confident the same will hold true for theaters as vaccinations ramp up and normalcy returns. \u2047 As we have said throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the studio's decision to push the vast majority of tentpoles to theatrical release in 2020 and 2022 is the best evidence of their commitment to the exhibition economic model. \u2047 The economics are straightforward. \u2047 Tentpole films cost well over $100 million to produce so the studios need theatrical release to maximize revenue for major pictures. \u2047 Of the projected top 30 box office films scheduled for release beginning in February 2020, only six films were moved to nontheatrical release and one other, Wonder Woman 1984, was released simultaneously to theaters and HBO Max. \u2047 In uniquely trying times, studios took the opportunity to test alternative delivery channels and for those with streaming services to add subscribers. \u2047 Even when in parts of the country, people could not leave their homes and theaters were either completely shut down or open with capacity and concessions restrictions, these releases had limited success. \u2047 After a couple of major tests with Wonder Woman 1984's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release and the release of Mulan, Trolls World Tour and Soul to premium video-on-demand or streaming video-on-demand, the studios withheld the vast majority of top films from digital-only distribution to preserve theatrical release in 2021. \u2047 On its recent earnings call, Disney reaffirmed it will release Black Widow theatrically, subject to opening cadence and consumer sentiment about going back to the movies, proving that all things being equal, Disney continues to see the enormous power of theatrical release for major motion pictures. \u2047 Likewise, Paramount recently publicly confirmed that Top Gun: Maverick will be released theatrically in July, again, subject to vaccination rollout. \u2047 In summary, despite the unique challenges presented by COVID-19, Hollywood continues to recognize that consumers still prefer to see movies on the big screen and don't embrace PVOD as a viable value alternative. \u2047 The decision to push theatrical release dates for the vast majority of major films, even after a unique period of experimentation, demonstrates that theatrical exhibition remains the preferred medium for consumers and the best format to deliver returns to the studios for major releases. \u2047 I also want to update you on our other major customer groups. \u2047 Approximately 94% of our nontheater operators are open or for seasonal businesses are closed in the normal course. \u2047 These businesses continue operating with appropriate safety protocols to comply with state and local requirements. \u2047 Performance remains fluid, depending on the impact of COVID-19 in each locale. \u2047 However, at a high level, our operators are resilient and performance has generally exceeded their expectations in the face of this lengthy pandemic. \u2047 Furthermore, we are seeing the benefit of owning drive-to value-oriented destinations. \u2047 I'll now provide a brief update on each of our property types. \u2047 The ski season is under way. \u2047 All of our ski resorts are open, and we're pleased with the results to date. \u2047 All of our Topgolf locations, all of our Andretti carting locations and all of our family entertainment centers are open. \u2047 All but one of our U.S. gyms are open. \u2047 About 61% of our attractions had opened for normal operations prior to normal seasonal shutdowns. \u2047 As we have indicated in past calls, a few of our attractions missed all or part of the season due to governmental health and sanitation measures and the financial feasibility of operating with reduced occupancy in a truncated season. \u2047 All of our cultural operators are open. \u2047 Except for the Kartrite Resort & Indoor Waterpark, all of our experiential lodging assets are open. \u2047 Kartrite remains subject to New York state's phased reopening plans, and we are planning for a Kartrite reopening in summer 2021. \u2047 Resorts World Catskills is open. \u2047 Finally, turning to our education portfolio, all of our early education centers are open. \u2047 We are seeing a steady increase in demand monthly as COVID restrictions ease and parents return to work. \u2047 All of our private schools remain open, utilizing a combination of in-person, online and hybrid instruction models. \u2047 Varying state and local requirements continue to influence each school's instruction model. \u2047 Volatility in reopening plans for public school systems has benefited private schools, and we believe parents continue to see the value of private school instruction. \u2047 We continued progress in executing our strategy to reduce our overall education portfolio. \u2047 In December, we sold six private schools and four early childhood education centers for net proceeds of $201 million. \u2047 These assets were sold at cash and GAAP cap rates based on base rents of 8.1% and 9%, respectively. \u2047 Note that over the past two years, we also collected average annual percentage rents of 6.3 million from three of the private schools based on total tuition levels. \u2047 However, these percentage rents were scheduled to expire over the next few years. \u2047 Overall, the assets included in this sale were an excellent investment for us with an unlevered internal rate of return of 13% over the life of our ownership. \u2047 Additionally, we sold four experiential properties and two vacant land parcels for net proceeds of around 23 million. \u2047 Total disposition proceeds in the quarter were 224 million. \u2047 During the quarter, we terminated all seven of our AMC transition leases and took back the properties. \u2047 We are executing our plans for each location. \u2047 In December, we completed the sale of one of the transition lease properties for an industrial use. \u2047 We are in various stages of active negotiation to sell another 5. \u2047 We anticipate these will result in various uses, including industrial, multifamily, office, retail and theater reuse. \u2047 We also took over management of two of our theaters. \u2047 One of the transition lease properties in Columbus, Ohio; and the former Goodrich Savoy in Champaign, Illinois. \u2047 We have retained a well-respected experienced theater management company to operate both locations on our behalf and both are open for business. \u2047 I want to take a moment to update you on the status of our cash collections and deferral agreements. \u2047 Cash collections have continued to improve in conjunction with reopenings. \u2047 Tenants and borrowers paid 46% of pre-COVID contractual cash revenue for the fourth quarter versus 29% and 43% in the second and third quarters, respectively. \u2047 As Mark will go over, we expect first quarter cash collections to significantly exceed fourth-quarter collections. \u2047 In January, we collected 66%. \u2047 And in February, collections are currently 64%. \u2047 In each case, of pre-COVID contractual cash revenue. \u2047 During the quarter, due to the continuing impact from COVID-19, we reserved the outstanding principal loan balance of 6.1 million and the unfunded commitment of 12.9 million for one of our attractions operators. \u2047 Customers representing approximately 95% of our pre-COVID contractual cash revenue, which includes each of our top 20 customers, are either paying their pre-COVID contract rent or interest or have deferral agreement in place. \u2047 In those deferral agreements, we have granted approximately 5% of permanent rent and interest payment reductions. \u2047 However, there can be no assurance that additional permanent rent or interest payment reductions or other term modifications will not occur in future periods in light of the continued adverse effect of the pandemic and financial condition of our customers, particularly with the ongoing uncertainty in the theater industry. \u2047 As we've discussed, our exhibition partners have faced and continue to face serious headwinds. \u2047 It goes without saying that the lack of product and reopening restrictions have weighed heavily on box office performance since early 2020 and"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly affo per diluted common share $0.23.  \u2047  qtrly total revenue from continuing
