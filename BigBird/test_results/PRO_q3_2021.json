{"article": ["Actual results could differ materially from such statements and our forecast. \u2047 In particular, there remains significant uncertainty around the duration and impact of COVID-19. \u2047 This means that results could change at any time, and the contemplated impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results and outlook is the best estimate, based on the information available as of today. \u2047 As a reminder, during the call we will discuss non-GAAP metrics. \u2047 Before I hand the call over, I'd like to remind our investors and analysts about our upcoming virtual Investor Fireside Chat, taking place on November 17th from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM Central Time during the 2021 PROS Outperform conference. \u2047 We ended the quarter with significant outperformance on our guidance ranges for profitability and cash flow, and delivered revenue results in line with our expected ranges. \u2047 We did see impact from the Delta variant in our Q3 results and our Q4 outlook. \u2047 Stefan will expand on this later. \u2047 Our strategy is to accelerate market adoption of the PROS Platform, deliver an incredible experience and drive significant value for our customers. \u2047 Despite the challenges we faced because of COVID-19, our team continues to execute well against our strategy. \u2047 We continue to drive incredible value for customers, evident by our expanding partnerships and best-in-class gross revenue retention rates. \u2047 We received industry recognition of our leadership in both CPQ and Price Optimization and Management. \u2047 When I look at all of this and the progress of the recovery, I couldn't be more excited for what is to come. \u2047 In Travel, we're starting to see international restrictions ease, and some carriers are seeing significant increases in passenger demand as a result. \u2047 For example, when the announcement was made that the Europe to U.S. travel ban would be lifted in November, carriers saw an immediate 140% increase in ticket sales in a single week for European travelers. \u2047 This demonstrates the pent-up demand for travel, both leisure and business, and energizes us for the pace of recovery heading into 2022, as more borders open. \u2047 Historically, this market segment didn't have access to the best-of-breed, AI-powered revenue management solutions. \u2047 We designed our PROS RM Essentials edition on the PROS Platform to enable teams of any size to adopt to our industry-leading AI and grow with PROS over time. \u2047 With PROS RM Essentials, customers like Air Transat and Scoot can forecast demand and dynamically priced to maximize revenue. \u2047 Now, moving to B2B; in the healthcare space, we're seeing demand for our solutions, as companies look to digitize their selling motions. \u2047 We're also seeing momentum in transportation and logistics, where companies are looking to PROS to enable them to deliver a frictionless sales experience, as demand continues to rise. \u2047 This year, air cargo demand is expected to increase approximately 20% year-over-year. \u2047 In Q3, Emirates SkyCargo adopted our B2B Platform to empower their customers with a self-service buying experience, to drive a higher conversion of sales, using our omnichannel quoting capabilities and capacity-aware price guidance. \u2047 Similarly, Marken, a division of UPS Healthcare Logistics, that is essential in the delivery of vaccines globally, also adopted our B2B Platform to power digital selling across their enterprise. \u2047 Our latest innovations are also inspiring existing customers to expand their partnerships with PROS. \u2047 In Q3, TE Connectivity, a PROS customer of eight years, chose to migrate to our cloud platform, which allowed them to expand adoption across their business. \u2047 TE Connectivity is a leading manufacturer of electronic connectors and sensors that powers vehicles, factories, and homes across the globe. \u2047 With hundreds of billions of products manufactured annually, TE Connectivity is relying on the scale, speed, and precision of PROS' Price Optimization and Management capabilities to drive winning offers. \u2047 Honeywell also expanded adoption of our Price Optimization and Management solution. \u2047 Like many businesses today, Honeywell is experiencing the impact of rising commodity prices and the risk of inflation. \u2047 To effectively manage volatility and continue to produce winning offers, Honeywell named PROS as their global pricing solution vendor, and is actively rolling out our solution to all their strategic business units. \u2047 Sheila Jordan, Honeywell's Chief Digital Technology Officer, will be joining me in my keynote at Outperform, to share more on their success with PROS. \u2047 Now, I am excited to share that we have been named a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Configure, Price and Quote Application Suites. \u2047 Our flexibility to support omnichannel selling, the combination of pricing and selling capabilities in a single platform, the performance, usability, and scalability of our platform were all cited as key strengths. \u2047 We also had the honor of once again being named a Leader in the 2021 IDC MarketScape Assessment of Worldwide B2B Price Optimization and Management Applications. \u2047 IDC emphasized the ease of use and transparency within our solutions as a key differentiator. \u2047 A core part of our strategy has been making our AI algorithms accessible, explainable, and extensible, which allows companies of all sizes to adopt our market-leading AI-powered platform. \u2047 As an engineer at heart, I'm incredibly proud of the market recognition we're receiving for our innovations, and I would like to express my deep gratitude to our amazing Product and Engineering teams. \u2047 With these most current designations, we're the only platform with a leadership position in both the CPQ and Price Optimization and Management markets. \u2047 In addition to our product awards, I am thrilled to share that PROS has been Certified by Great Places to Work for the second year in a row. \u2047 This year's designation extends the Company's original certification to all eligible countries, recognizing our inclusive, people-first culture on a global scale. \u2047 This award is based entirely on what current employees have to say about working at PROS, which is what makes this award so special to me. \u2047 Finally, in September, we announced Rob Reiner's intention to retire from PROS. \u2047 As Chief Technology Officer, Rob has been key in driving our culture of innovation forward. \u2047 Rob joined PROS in 2016 to lead our pivotal transition to the cloud. \u2047 With his leadership, we transformed our Travel and B2B solutions into the most comprehensive and innovative SaaS offerings in their markets. \u2047 Succeeding Rob, Ajay Damani has been promoted to the role of Executive Vice President of Engineering, and Sunil John has been promoted to the role of Chief Product Officer. \u2047 Ajay and Sunil each have over 15 years of experience with PROS, and have been a huge part of our success. \u2047 I look forward to working closely with them, and continuing to accelerate our innovation leadership. \u2047 In closing, I'm proud of how our team is executing to drive adoption in the market, deliver industry-leading innovations through our platform, and create a culture that empowers every employee to reach their full potential. \u2047 In the third quarter, we significantly outperformed our profitability and cash flow metrics and delivered revenue results that were in line with our expectations. \u2047 Our team continues to look for ways to drive efficiencies, as well as improve our customer satisfaction and collection processes. \u2047 As a result of our strong operational execution, our outlook for the full year is now much better on profitability and cash flow. \u2047 As Andres mentioned, the ongoing impact from COVID-19 and specifically the Delta Variant, did affect some of our travel customers in the third quarter. \u2047 Examples of the impact during the quarter include; a travel customer declaring bankruptcy, a small number of contract restructurings, and some of our new opportunities and implementations being pushed by a few months. \u2047 Individually, none of these items significantly impacted our revenues, but the combination of these items did impact our subscription and services revenues slightly in the third quarter. \u2047 These items will also impact our fourth quarter revenues, and we expect total revenue for the year to be at the low end of our previous annual guidance range. \u2047 All of these items impacting the second half of 2021 are temporary in nature. \u2047 We expect to recover most, if not all, of these amounts during 2022. \u2047 Now moving on to our results; subscription revenue in the third quarter was $44.1 million, up 5% year-over-year and total revenue was $62.7 million, up 2% year-over-year. \u2047 Our third quarter recurring revenue was 84% of total revenue. \u2047 Our gross revenue retention rate for the trailing 12 months was approximately 91%. \u2047 As a reminder, we disclose gross revenue retention rates, not net revenue retention rates. \u2047 Gross revenue retention does not include bookings from existing customers, which can mask real customer churn. \u2047 Our revenue retention rates have continued to improve throughout 2021 and we anticipate ending the year at approximately 93%. \u2047 This returns us to world-class gross revenue retention rates and demonstrates the value our customers see in our solutions. \u2047 Our non-GAAP total gross margins improved sequentially again to 61%, and our non-GAAP subscription gross margins were 72%, which are up sequentially from 71% and also up year-over-year. \u2047 We expect subscription margins to remain relatively constant in the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 We also continue to make steady progress on our services margins and were within $200,000 of breakeven in the third quarter. \u2047 As I mentioned before, we continue to make progress on adjusted EBITDA and were very pleased with our performance this quarter. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA loss was $4.4 million as compared to $6.2 million last year. \u2047 Revenue growth and reduced operating expenses led to this improvement. \u2047 Total operating expenses declined by 5% in the quarter and 6% in the first nine months of the year. \u2047 I am proud of our team's strong operational execution and how we continue to look for ways to drive more efficiency into our business. \u2047 Our calculated billings decreased 5% for the quarter and for the trailing 12 months. \u2047 And as previously mentioned, we anticipate calculated billings will grow in the fourth quarter, which would result in full year growth of at least 10%. \u2047 Our free cash flow burn was $8.5 million in Q3 and $18.9 million year-to-date, a significant improvement over last year, driven by a combination of operating expense efficiencies, strong customer collections, and better gross revenue retention rates. \u2047 We exited the third quarter with $308.6 million of cash and investments. \u2047 We also made nice progress toward our year-end target of adding quota-carrying personnel, and we ended the quarter with 64. \u2047 We were able to hire ahead of plan, which allows our new team members to ramp up, so that they can be productive earlier in 2022. \u2047 We do not anticipate growing this metric further in the fourth quarter. \u2047 And as previously discussed, we expect to exit the year with 60 or more quota-carrying personnel. \u2047 Now turning to guidance; we expect Q4 subscription revenue to be in the range of $45 million to $45.5 million and total revenue to be in the range of $63 million to $64 million. \u2047 We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA loss to be between $9 million and $10 million. \u2047 Using an estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 22%, we anticipate fourth quarter non-GAAP loss per share of between $0.22 and $0.24 per share, based on an estimated 44.4 million shares outstanding. \u2047 For the full year, we expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $176 million to $176.5 million and total revenue to be in the range of $249.5 million to $250.5 million. \u2047 We expect an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $27.3 million and $28.3 million, and a free cash flow burn between $22 million and $25 million. \u2047 We also expect our ending ARR on a constant currency basis to be between $214 million and $217 million. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["qtrly total revenue $62.7 million versus $61.5 million.  \u2047  sees q4
