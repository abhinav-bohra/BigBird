{"article": ["Once again, I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented times. \u2047 As you know, Maurice Marciano was injured in a bicycle accident recently. \u2047 He is under great care, but we expect this will be a long recovery process for him. \u2047 On behalf of Paul, our Board and our entire Guess? \u2047 family, we pray for his fast and full recovery. \u2047 Maurice is an amazing person. \u2047 He is very strong. \u2047 And we all hope to get him back soon. \u2047 In the next few minutes, I will speak about the overall environment and our Company, then I will touch on our second quarter results and I will close with how I see our outlook for this year and into the future. \u2047 , we are managing through the situation with our eyes on the road and our hands firmly on the steering wheel. \u2047 I'm very proud that our teams around the world continue to rise to the challenge imposed by this crisis in an extraordinary way. \u2047 I believe that the progress we made in the second quarter, both with our financial results and with our initiatives to better position the Company for the future, demonstrates our team's strong leadership, their relentless hard work and their amazing commitment to our customers and our Company. \u2047 Since we last spoke, a few things have changed in the world and in our Company, and some have stayed the same. \u2047 Among those things that changed, the most important one is visibility, which has improved meaningfully. \u2047 Starting with our store reopenings in all regions, we have had relatively consistent performance for several weeks now. \u2047 Almost across the board, we have seen a significant reduction in customer traffic from the comparable prior-year period, partially offset by the improved conversion rates. \u2047 Improved visibility is helping us size our expected demand more effectively, and as a result, we can project our inventory needs more accurately, which is key to optimizing future sales, margins and profitability. \u2047 Improved visibility helped us to better assess our liquidity, enabling us to capitalize on share repurchases that we think offer a material long-term return opportunity for our shareholders. \u2047 And improved visibility gave our Board the confidence to reinstate our quarterly dividend. \u2047 The second change relates to customers' lifestyles and shopping behaviors, which clearly have not returned to pre-pandemic conditions. \u2047 This, to us, signals that the changes may be more permanent than we originally thought. \u2047 While many people feel more comfortable shopping online than in stores, those that do venture out are much more intentional to make a purchase when they visit. \u2047 Our e-commerce business in North America and Europe delivered high single-digit revenue growth during the second quarter, and gross profit dollars grew more than 20% as margins improved significantly as a result of increased full price selling and improved IMUs. \u2047 We are confident that our e-commerce business will accelerate in the second half of the year as we increase our investment in marketing, continue to reposition our product offering and complete our Salesforce platform implementation. \u2047 We are encouraged with our digital business in August, which was up in the teens, and again, with improved margins, driven by strong performance in Europe and, to a lesser degree, in North America. \u2047 We continue to see that product priorities have shifted toward more casual dressing. \u2047 We expect this to evolve over time as people begin to go out again, but we believe that casual and comfortable clothes will remain a key priority for our customers. \u2047 Based on this trend, we are investing in the development of a strong assortment of active apparel, outerwear, stretch and sustainable denim and an extensive line of tops and dresses in multiple colors that capitalize on high quality and comfortable knit fabrications. \u2047 We are also focused on seasonal lines and essential products and strong lines of accessories, including handbags. \u2047 While we reduced marketing spend dramatically during the second quarter, we see an opportunity to increase our investment in the second half of the year to continue to strengthen our brand position and drive traffic. \u2047 We are planning multiple campaigns for the season featuring several of our product lines of women's, men's, accessories and kids'. \u2047 has recently engaged Italian actor and singer, Michele Morrone, as a new worldwide face of GUESS men's. \u2047 Michele Morrone is a lead actor in the movie, 365 Days, one of the top movies of Netflix, currently streaming in 200 countries. \u2047 He will be featured in our fall/winter 2020 collection campaign. \u2047 We intend to intensify our global efforts in digital media, including social media, and have plans for direct mail, TV advertising and outdoor media, including billboards, buses and others. \u2047 One very positive industry development relates to inventory ownership in our market, which seems to be already rebalanced and better aligned with current customer demand. \u2047 This should result in a less promotional environment going forward, leading to improved product margins. \u2047 We continue to make inventory management a key strategic initiative and made good progress this quarter as we experienced a product margin increase and our inventories are in a good place. \u2047 At quarter-end, inventories were down 13%, and we own less clearance inventory than a year ago. \u2047 For the rest of the year, we continue to plan our inventory purchases based on expected demand and have built flexibility with fast-track processes and basic product ownership to react to potential higher demand. \u2047 We already see opportunities for increased business and believe that we will be able to capitalize on this strategy. \u2047 With respect to resource utilization and cost structure, I'm very impressed by our team's ability to do a lot more with less, achieving greater efficiencies and significant reductions in our cost structure, both temporary and permanent. \u2047 Katie will spend more time on this later on. \u2047 Regarding things that have stayed the same, unfortunately the pandemic is still with us, and we have seen new outbreaks in multiple countries. \u2047 People are still very uncomfortable socializing and leaving their homes. \u2047 And for now, tourism continues to be non-existent between countries as a result of restrictions and low willingness to travel. \u2047 I recently read that in July, the amount of tourism spend in Europe was down 95%, with the Chinese spend down 98%. \u2047 For this reasons, we are approaching the second half of the year cautiously. \u2047 We continue to make our priority the safety and well-being of our teams, our customers and the communities that we serve. \u2047 We closed all California stores in enclosed malls after having them reopened, and we are now reopening many of them again. \u2047 We are happy to report that most of our stores worldwide are now reopened. \u2047 Our headquarter buildings in North America and in Europe have been operating at 50% capacity and the remaining team members work remotely. \u2047 As we closed our second quarter, we were pleased with how we managed the business in light of the circumstances presented by the pandemic. \u2047 Our retail sales were better than originally anticipated, and our wholesale businesses, which also performed better than expected, benefited from some product shipments pull-forward from the third quarter into the second quarter as many European customers requested products earlier than expected. \u2047 Margins were better than planned as we managed inventories well and benefited from positive rent relief in Europe. \u2047 We also managed cost effectively during the period. \u2047 All in all, we reported a 41.7% revenue decline, and we almost broke even at the operating level for the period on an adjusted basis. \u2047 As we look into the second half of the year, we expect a slow recovery of our retail business, driven by similar metrics to those that we have seen since we have reopened our stores, but with a gradual improvement in customer traffic. \u2047 We believe that there is an opportunity to expand the holiday selling period and have worked on plans to begin the season earlier with direct mail, customer appointments, optimizing omnichannel capabilities and focusing on other initiatives to avoid customer congestion during peak periods. \u2047 Regarding our wholesale business, during the last week of June, we launched our spring/summer sales campaign with a live event in Lugano, Switzerland, which was attended by over 200 people. \u2047 Plus, the event was live-streamed and over 550 people participated. \u2047 I believe this was unusual in our industry and was very well received by our customers. \u2047 Paul, with the creative teams, have done an incredible job with the collection, and I believe that the product line is the best that I have seen in all my years with Guess? \u2047 The response to the line has been very positive, and the customers' interest in our brand is very strong. \u2047 We are very excited about the opportunities that we see to gain market share, even in the near term. \u2047 This year, we continue our strategic planning implementation work, and I'm very pleased with our progress. \u2047 We still believe that our Company is in a strong position to capture the 500 basis points improvement in operating margins that we had targeted last year as most of the improvements are expected to be driven by operational efficiencies that we are confident remain available to us in the near future. \u2047 Our brand positioning work is in full force. \u2047 Our commitment is to elevate our GUESS and MARCIANO brands, focusing on high quality materials, SKU rationalization and developing one global line for each brand, while addressing market needs with specific products by region. \u2047 We continue to believe that our brand DNA and our obsession for inclusivity, sustainability and celebrating customer diversity represent a significant strength in today's environment. \u2047 Regarding our customer-centricity initiatives, we implemented Salesforce for our GUESS website in North America and in two European countries, France and the UK. \u2047 Tomorrow, we are launching 19 additional countries in Europe and 26 more will be rolled out through the rest of September and October. \u2047 We also launched the customer 360 project that I mentioned in our last call, and we continue to upgrade our omnichannel capabilities. \u2047 The entire plan should be fully implemented by the end of next year. \u2047 We continue to believe that our e-commerce business penetration will grow as a result of this strategic initiative to represent over 23% of our direct-to-consumer business in three to five years, up from 13% last year. \u2047 We plan to update our entire strategic business plan in the next few months and share it with you during the fourth quarter and an Investor and Analyst meeting. \u2047 In closing, while we are approaching the short term cautiously, we are focused on the long term and we see very bright days ahead. \u2047 Our vision for our Company and our brand remain intact. \u2047 I strongly believe that the long-term impact of this crisis in our Company will be extremely valuable as we reposition our brand and redesign our business model. \u2047 The crisis inspired our team to think differently to challenge every aspect of the business and to architect a simpler, more efficient and capital-light model. \u2047 We're building a business that will be better positioned to compete in the future and gain market share globally. \u2047 We have a true iconic global brand that has been relevant for consumers all over the world for 40 years. \u2047 stayed relevant by adapting its model time and time again. \u2047 I believe that companies that adapt their business models to actively embrace new consumer preferences, placing the customer at the center of everything they do, will gain share and overcome this crisis faster. \u2047 We fully expect to be one of those companies. \u2047 We have a strong team which is even more excited about our future today than I have seen it since I came back to Guess? \u2047 I strongly believe that in the next few years we will deliver outsized returns to our shareholders. \u2047 Paul and I and our entire leadership team couldn't be more excited about our future. \u2047 With that, let me pass it to Katie. \u2047 This is our second quarter navigating the Company through what is, no doubt, the most challenging period in our history. \u2047 So while consumers remain cautious, we were pleasantly surprised with the initial level of productivity that we saw as our stores reopened across each region during the quarter. \u2047 This is a sign not only of a macro recovery, but also the strength of our brand and the effectiveness of the business decisions that we have made over the last few months. \u2047 Once again this quarter, we have proven that we can successfully control the middle of the P&L with appropriate reactions to current environment, all while maintaining an emphasis on the long-term health of our brands. \u2047 We decreased operating expenses by $70 million, expanded product margins and maintained a very clean inventory position. \u2047 And as a result, even with sales down over 40%, we were able to maintain almost breakeven adjusted net earnings and a solid balance sheet. \u2047 I'm happy to report that our liquidity position remains strong. \u2047 I believe this is a competitive advantage for us, allowing us the flexibility to make appropriate investments to drive our long-term strategy as well as return value to shareholders. \u2047 In the first quarter, at the beginning of the pandemic, we took strong actions to preserve our liquidity, not having a clear outlook into what the future held given the uncertainty of the global crisis. \u2047 We drew down on our credit facility, extended our ABL and secured additional low interest term loans in Europe. \u2047 As the situation began to stabilize during the second quarter, we paid back a significant portion of the borrowings on our drawn revolving lines and seized the opportunity to return incremental value to our shareholders with a $39 million repurchase of our shares. \u2047 In addition, we announced today that our Board has decided not to declare any cash dividends from the prior two quarters, and it has approved the resumption of our quarterly dividend program this quarter. \u2047 Our long-term capital allocation policy has not changed. \u2047 Now let me take you through some of the details on our performance for the quarter. \u2047 Let's start with sales. \u2047 Second quarter revenues were $399 million, down 42% in US dollars and 41% in constant currency. \u2047 Revenues were negatively impacted by store closures in all regions at the beginning of the quarter and lower productivity to prior year at stores once open. \u2047 Our stores were closed for approximately 30% of the days in the quarter, and when they were open, traffic was roughly half of our customer flow in the prior year. \u2047 Overall sales productivity for our retail stores since reopening for the quarter was down 21% in the US and Canada, down 31% in Europe and down 26% in Asia. \u2047 We have been seeing traffic declines, partially offset by significantly higher conversion. \u2047 And our tourist-centric locations have been experiencing a tougher recovery. \u2047 Our e-commerce business in North America and Europe was up[Phonetic] 9% for the quarter. \u2047 Our wholesale and licensing partners were experiencing similar decreases in demand, resulting in lower sales in these areas in Q2 as well. \u2047 Gross margin for the quarter was 36.9%, 2% lower than the prior year. \u2047 Our product margin increased 210 basis points this quarter primarily as a result of higher IMU as well as lower promotions. \u2047 However, this was more than offset by occupancy deleverage of 410 basis points on lower sales. \u2047 Regarding rent, we"], "gold_summary": ["q2 revenue $399 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $384.8 million.  \u2047  continued to tightly manage costs and inventory position.  \u2047  not providing detailed guidance for q3 ending october 31, 2020 or full fiscal year ending january 30, 2021.  \u2047  expect revenues for third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 to decrease in
