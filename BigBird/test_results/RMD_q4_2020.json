{"article": ["Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO Mick Farrell and CFO Brett Sandercock. \u2047 Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call during today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. \u2047 We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. \u2047 However, our actual results may differ. \u2047 During this global pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease state it leads to, I hope that you, your family and your friends remain safe and healthy during these times. \u2047 Way back in early January, a ResMed employee, a ResMedian in Hubei province, China, put on a hazmat suit and helped set up ventilators to provide the gift of breath to many thousands of people that turned out in that city, while their immune systems fought against the first global cases of COVID-19 that ResMed saw in Wuhan. \u2047 Since that time, seven months ago, our global team has provided vital support globally to combat this coronavirus, not just across China, but across Asia, then across Europe, across North America. \u2047 And now we are just starting to -- preparing to -- actually, we're in the midst of continuing that battle in Latin America in, sub-Sahara and Africa and parts of the Middle East and Asia that still have that, what we call, the peak impact ahead of them in terms of hospitalizations and ventilator needs. \u2047 So I noted in our call 90 days ago, our Q3 call, that we would do more to support the global community and local healthcare systems with ventilators and ventilation mask systems across the 140 countries that we serve. \u2047 During Q4, during this June quarter, we produced around 100,000 invasive and noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel positive pressure ventilators. \u2047 That brings our cumulative total to over 150,000 ventilators that we produced since the beginning of calendar year 2020. \u2047 So we've delivered on our promise to triple our production. \u2047 And in fact, if you take the period from January 1 to June 30, for 2020, that is a 3.5 times increase over the period for 2019, so 3.5 times. \u2047 For our flagship ventilator, which is the Astral life support ventilator, we reached a peak of over five times our weekly production rate during the period. \u2047 And we're still running at full capacity for the Astral to ensure that ResMed is there for, what we call, preservation of life as the coronavirus continues to move around the globe. \u2047 I'm particularly proud of the role that our supply chain, our manufacturing, our distribution and our tech services teams have played during this coronavirus crisis, making sure that ResMed device and a complete ventilation system was there at the bedside when someone needed help breathing as their immune system fights against COVID-19. \u2047 So, looking forward, we have built a sophisticated set of analytic capabilities, including an epidemiology patient model that has helped us model the impacts of both the headwinds and the tailwinds that are part of this COVID-19 crisis, and we have detailed scenarios of the impacts by city, by region, by country and by ResMed business line. \u2047 Through all that analysis, I'm happy to say that we're confident in our ResMed ability to execute across the full range of potential scenarios for all of our customers and for all of our global businesses. \u2047 The tailwinds for ventilation in the March quarter and the June quarter from both the ventilator devices and the ventilation mask systems are starting to recede. \u2047 And while we are still working on current and future contracts with hospitals, as well as city and national health authorities for these ventilators, the volumes will be significantly lower in the September quarter for these ventilators. \u2047 At the same time, the headwinds we experienced, especially in the June quarter, for our sleep apnea and COPD patient flow and patient diagnosis are also receding. \u2047 So, people are starting to return for their primary care physician visits. \u2047 They're starting to return for their specialist physician visits. \u2047 And we see the system today growing from its nadir during the last period as we now see city by city and country by country, the markets are coming back online. \u2047 So over the portfolio of 140 countries that we serve, we expect a gradual, sequential, quarter to quarter, U-shaped recovery of patient flow to primary care physicians, sleep physicians, as well as pulmonary physicians that are treating COPD and asthma throughout fiscal year 2021. \u2047 We expect the expansion of home sleep apnea testing to continue. \u2047 As it did during the crisis, we think it will continue post the crisis. \u2047 And we also expect a steady sort of sequential increase in sleep lab activity and visits to the pulmonary specialists both in person and through telehealth, which has been expanding rapidly under COVID. \u2047 Additionally, some very early research into the post-COVID clinical world shows that select patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may have lung damage, and some of them may require long-term ventilator support. \u2047 This is an additional area for focus for us, but I have to say, it's very early days in that area. \u2047 I'll also recap our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy and some execution highlights against some of our key operating priorities as part of that strategy. \u2047 Finally, I'll discuss how we are advancing and learning in a post-COVID peak world, including how this pandemic has accelerated three important trends: One, the importance of respiratory medicine. \u2047 Two, the importance of digital health. \u2047 And three, the importance of outside-hospital healthcare. \u2047 These are three key elements of our ResMed 2025 strategy that were in play well before the global pandemic. \u2047 But these are theee trends that have accelerated during this pandemic, and we think the momentum will continue in a post-COVID world. \u2047 So, to our business performance. \u2047 We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal-year 2020. \u2047 We had year on year annual 15% top line revenue growth to $3 billion in annual revenue for ResMed. \u2047 Our results reflect strong growth and positive momentum across our innovative medtech portfolio and our market-leading digital health software solutions. \u2047 We have grown our global market footprint, finding new patients in the midst of a global pandemic, and we have driven growth with recurring revenue from our installed base of sleep apnea patients. \u2047 While our financial results in March and June have benefited from high demand for ventilation devices and lower operating costs, our underlying core business of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma remains strong and well positioned for long-term growth. \u2047 During fiscal year 2020, we generated $802 million of cash that allowed us to return $225 million of cash dividends to you, our shareholders, while also investing in our future with a double-digit increase in R&D, including clinical research, both digital and in person, as well as design and digital innovation across our sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and our software as a service businesses. \u2047 We have a full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium- and long-term growth opportunities, with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs. \u2047 Importantly, we have also seen significant growth in our digital health ecosystem. \u2047 We now have over 6.5 billion nights of sleep and respiratory medical data in the air solutions platform. \u2047 We have grown connectivity to our digital health ecosystem by over 26% this fiscal year, and we now have over 12 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices in the market. \u2047 And we have around 14 million patients enrolled in the AirView software solution. \u2047 Our digital health ecosystem is a competitive advantage for ResMed that offers innovative solutions, as well as integrated care to drive superior outcomes, better patient experiences and lower healthcare system costs. \u2047 Our acquisition and continued investment and development of the propeller platform has been a digital health accelerant for ResMed. \u2047 Our recently announced commercial partnership with Novartis, which I will describe in more detail later during the call, is a great example of this progress with propeller. \u2047 During the last 12 months, we have improved 16 million lives by providing a person with a device or complete mask system to help them breathe. \u2047 Importantly, the ability to help these patients on their individual journey to better sleep and better breathing is powered by the over 6.5 billion nights of medical data in our ecosystem. \u2047 These data form a significant competitive advantage as they enable us to perform sophisticated analytics and drive actionable insights to benefit all of our customer groups, including the patients most importantly, but also improving workflows for physicians, for providers, for payers and for full healthcare systems. \u2047 Fundamentally, we believe the future of healthcare delivery is outside the hospital. \u2047 That's where ResMed competes today, and that's where we win today. \u2047 Globally, there are 936 million people with sleep apnea. \u2047 There are over 380 million people who suffer from COPD, and there are over 340 million people living with asthma. \u2047 They all need our help, and they all want that help at home, definitely not in a hospital. \u2047 Our SaaS business is 100% focused on out-of-hospital care, leveraging the global trend for seniors to age in place. \u2047 We think this trend will accelerate in a post COVID world. \u2047 ResMed can provide seamless care for our portfolio of out-of-hospital care settings, including home medical equipment, skilled nursing facilities, senior living, life plan communities, home health, hospice, as well as home care services. \u2047 COVID-19 has accelerated the rapid adoption of digital health technologies, the recognition of the value of remote monitoring, virtual diagnosis and the evolution of global reimbursement models in the field of digital health. \u2047 This acceleration of digital health adoption represents a significant medium to long-term tailwind for our business. \u2047 These three trends, the increased importance of respiratory medicine, the increased importance of digital health and the increased importance of out-of-hospital healthcare will help ResMed achieve our goal to improve 250 million lives by 2025. \u2047 So on to our operating priorities. \u2047 We have three operating priorities that guide our daily focus here at ResMed. \u2047 1 is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets. \u2047 With over 1.6 billion people across these three chronic disease states, we know that delivering our innovative solutions to these underpenetrated markets is our clear No. \u2047 2 priority is to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices, as well as digital health technology solutions to better engage physicians, providers and payers, as well as patients so that we can improve clinical outcomes so we can reduce costs, and we can enhance the patient experience. \u2047 3 priority is to innovate and grow the world's best seamless software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital. \u2047 We think ResMed is uniquely positioned to deliver on these three priorities. \u2047 So, I'll quickly walk through some examples of innovation in each of these priorities, and then we'll hand over to Brett and go to Q&A. \u2047 In our core market of sleep apnea, we launched, what we call, the ResMed MaskSelector into our US geography. \u2047 The ResMed MaskSelector is a digital health technology to make remote patient mask selection and sizing both easier and more effective, helping the patient themselves receive the care they need from home. \u2047 We think that this is the digital solution to help our home medical equipment or HME customers in their challenge to find the right mask for each patient when they can't physically touch them due to physical distancing during COVID-19. \u2047 We are providing this solution at no charge during the coronavirus public health emergency. \u2047 However, we think this technology's efficiency and benefits for both providers and patients will last well beyond the pandemic. \u2047 Digital tools like this, as well as capabilities, including video support for doctors and their patients, as well as remote mask patient fittings, have seen good application during COVID-19. \u2047 Combined with our mask resupply solutions, including SnapWorx, AeroCare and Brightree resupply, we have delivered solid mask growth. \u2047 In terms of new patient flow, the COVID lockdowns have had a significant impact on our business. \u2047 We saw double-digit declines in new sleep apnea patient flow across all markets that experienced lockdowns. \u2047 Individual cities, regions and countries had unique approaches to any lockdown and reopening processes. \u2047 For instance, today, in Germany, we stand at more than 85% of pre-COVID sleep lab capacity already up and running. \u2047 Whereas in China, at the other end of the spectrum, we stand at 50% of pre-COVID diagnostic capacity in that geography. \u2047 Most of the other 140 countries that we sell into around the world fall somewhere between those two extremes. \u2047 In big countries like the US, it's a story of 50 states with unique models, again, as a spectrum between these boundary conditions. \u2047 The average in the United States is probably somewhere in that 70% of diagnostic capability but some states will be closer to the 60% range, and some will be closer to the 75% range. \u2047 As I stated earlier, we expect a steady, sequential, quarter-by-quarter, sort of U-shaped recovery of the sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patient flow throughout fiscal 2021. \u2047 Clearly, a highly effective vaccine or a highly efficacious treatment for COVID-19 could, of course, turn that U-shape into a dramatic V-shaped recovery. \u2047 However, we are not counting on that. \u2047 And an event like that remains upside from what we call our expected or likely case scenario. \u2047 In terms of execution in our second key disease state of COPD and our ventilation solutions for COPD and other lung conditions, we launched our cloud-based remote monitoring software called AirView for our ventilator solutions in Europe, including the Astral product, the Stellar ventilator and the Lumis ventilator. \u2047 Through AirView, clinicians and care providers can now remotely monitor their patient's respiratory rate, as well as their blood oxygen saturation. \u2047 These are two critical indicators for a respiratory patient's condition. \u2047 We accelerated the delivery of this technology for clear and urgent needs during the pandemic. \u2047 However, this enhanced AirView capability, providing insights across European ventilation patient populations will provide differentiation for ResMed through the clinical value for physicians and better outcome for patients in perpetuity. \u2047 In terms of execution in our third key disease state of asthma, ResMed has partnered with Novartis to co-package the prop"], "gold_summary": ["q4 non-gaap earnings per share $1.33.  \u2047  q4 gaap earnings per share $1.22.  \u2047  qtrly revenue increased 9% to $770.3
