{"article": ["I'd also like to call your attention to supplemental slides related to our 2021 outlook posted on our website in the Investor Relations section. \u2047 The company has explained some of these risks and uncertainties in its SEC filings included in the Risk Factors section of its annual report under Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. \u2047 Additionally, in our discussion today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Today, I'm joined by Ed Pesicka, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Long, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 This effort and focus has reinforced our position in the healthcare industry as a trusted partner by delivering on our mission of Empowering our Customers to Advance Healthcare. \u2047 In addition, I am extremely pleased to be here today and report another strong quarter and close out of a record year. \u2047 The strong performance in the quarter as well as the full year was a result of the successful execution and implementation of the key initiatives discussed during the previous quarterly earnings calls, which included two major items: one, infrastructure investments, with a focus on current and long-term profitable growth; and two, operational improvements, with a focus on enhancing the customer experience and increasing operating efficiencies. \u2047 Starting with our Global Products segment, let me remind you of the infrastructure investments and operational improvements we shared previously during the past year. \u2047 At a high level, we expanded our manufacturing output to align with the volume commitments of our customers. \u2047 Here are just a few examples of these investments and operational improvements: one, the installation of new N95 production lines in our U.S.-based manufacturing facilities; two, we added nonwoven fabric manufacturing in our Lexington, North Carolina facility; three, we continued to expand our isolation and surgical gown production capacity; and four, we optimized the operational process to maximize output of the production lines. \u2047 These investments and operational improvements enabled us to strengthen our position as one of the world's largest vertically integrated manufacturer of healthcare PPE. \u2047 We manufacture a full range of healthcare PPE categories and subcategories, primarily manufactured in the Americas. \u2047 These products are manufactured in our factories with our teammates, with our technology, with our fabric, with our patents, with our processes and with our quality and regulatory oversight. \u2047 And then they're delivered through our network of distribution centers, with our teammates and our technologies. \u2047 Along those lines, let me remind you of the infrastructure investments and operational improvements we shared previously during the past year related to our Global Solutions segment. \u2047 One, we expanded our low-unit-of-measure warehouse infrastructure system. \u2047 Two, we improved our inventory planning processes and algorithms. \u2047 Three, we enhanced our data management service offering through QSight and the launching of myOM. \u2047 We improved our B2B and B2C offerings in our home healthcare business. \u2047 And lastly, we optimized the operational process to continue to improve our controllable service metrics. \u2047 The combination of these investments and operational improvements in our Global Products and our Global Solutions segment continue to strengthen our position in supporting our customers across the entire value chain, with our products and our distribution network delivering what is needed to both the hospital as well as the home, while utilizing our services and data management to increase customer efficiency. \u2047 The compelling results in Q4 and the full year of 2020 were driven by these investments and operational improvements, along with the dedication of our teammates and our overall commitment to enhancing the customer experience. \u2047 Let me now share a few items from Q4 that validate our solid results. \u2047 One, we achieved an increase of nearly 400% in adjusted net income per share compared to the fourth quarter in 2019. \u2047 Two, we realized an increase of more than 200% in adjusted operating income versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. \u2047 Three, we expanded our Q4 adjusted operating margins by 340 basis points versus the prior year. \u2047 Four, we launched and successfully executed an upsized follow-on equity offering of nearly $200 million. \u2047 Five, we reduced the debt by over $300 million in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Six, and specifically related to Global Solutions segment, we grew revenue by 5% sequentially from Q3 to Q4, while maintaining industry-leading service levels. \u2047 Seven, specifically related to Global Products segment, we grew revenue by 21% sequentially from Q3 to Q4. \u2047 And since the beginning of the year, we manufactured record levels of PPE with approximately five billion units produced, with materials manufactured in our American factories or Owens & Minor-owned facilities. \u2047 Eight, we generated operating cash flow of $71 million as a result of the increased earnings and working capital improvements. \u2047 And lastly, we continued to make investments in infrastructure, service and technology. \u2047 As you can tell, the fourth quarter was a remarkable close to 2020. \u2047 It is, in fact, an extension of our track record of strong performance during the entire year. \u2047 Here are some of the highlights from the full year of 2020. \u2047 One, for the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased 265% from $0.62 to $2.26. \u2047 Two, we continued the trend of recording year-over-year gross margin expansion, with gross margin expanding by 285 basis points. \u2047 Three, we more than doubled our operating cash flow to $339 million as a result of increased earnings and working capital improvements. \u2047 Four, we paid down debt by $534 million during the year, and it should be noted that we have reduced debt by more than $700 million over the past seven quarters. \u2047 Five, we achieved year-over-year gross margin expansion in every quarter of 2020, making it seven consecutive quarters of year-over-year gross margin expansion. \u2047 Six, we generated positive operating cash flow in every quarter of 2020, also making it seven consecutive quarters of positive operating cash flow. \u2047 Next, we delivered year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis in every quarter of 2020, making it five consecutive quarters of year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis. \u2047 And finally, we reached a milestone in the COVID-19 fight, with nearly 12 billion units of PPE delivered during the year. \u2047 Look, I'm extremely pleased with our incredible results in 2020, which signify our stellar operating performance across the board. \u2047 It is our Americas owned and operated facilities, along with the strong distribution network, that provides Owens & Minor with the unique ability to support the entire value chain. \u2047 This differentiates us and puts us in a strong position for long-term profitable growth. \u2047 Let me now shift to 2021 and focus on the areas that will shape the year and the future of Owens & Minor. \u2047 These areas of focus will be investments, operational improvements and financial strength. \u2047 Let me begin with financial strength. \u2047 During 2020, we significantly deleveraged our balance sheet, implemented sustainable operational improvements and made investments for growth. \u2047 We expect 2021 to be an extension of these actions, enabling continued deleveraging of the balance sheet and profit improvement. \u2047 As a result of the deleveraging achieved in 2020, we now have greater latitude to make investments in our business for future growth. \u2047 So moving on to investments. \u2047 We will focus our investments on both organic and inorganic growth. \u2047 Our investment strategy will remain disciplined, and we'll continue to focus on infrastructure, technology and operational improvements. \u2047 Our organic growth investments will consist of: one, product portfolio expansion within our PPE, surgical infection and prevention categories and subcategories; two, product portfolio expansion outside of our PPE, surgical infection and prevention categories and subcategories; three, expansion into new verticals that utilize our product portfolio and expanded product portfolio; four, enhanced technology, utilizing the data and services we provide to our customers; five, harnessing our enterprisewide offerings to further enhance our customer experience; and six, complete the build-out of our continuous improvement team. \u2047 Related to inorganic growth investments, our focus will be primarily on portfolio and end-market expansions. \u2047 Let me now discuss operational improvements. \u2047 We have begun the implementation of the Owens & Minor business system that is an enterprisewide business discipline consisting of the following: one, continuous improvement, continuous improvement, which is focused on delivering an enhanced customer experience while providing efficiency, improved output and financial achievements; two, standard management systems, which is based on definable metrics that will be measured and evaluated; and finally, program management, which will be utilized for alignment and execution of our strategic priorities and key initiatives. \u2047 The Owens & Minor business system is the next step in the formalization of the actions utilized over the past two years to significantly improve our medical distribution service levels, to increase our manufacturing output to record levels, to develop and implement new technology and to deliver our strong performance. \u2047 Let me now close with our 2021 outlook. \u2047 First, we expect a strong momentum from Q4 to carry into 2021 related to the demand for our manufactured PPE. \u2047 Secondly, we expect elective procedures to continue to improve throughout the year. \u2047 And finally, we expect continued increase in demand for our home healthcare business, which is positioned well in one of the fastest-growing healthcare market segments. \u2047 As I have discussed earlier, we had a strong fourth quarter and successful 2020. \u2047 And I'm immensely proud of our accomplishments and the dedication of the Owens & Minor teammates. \u2047 And we expect this momentum to continue into 2021. \u2047 It is clear that our robust operational execution, combined with strategic investments, have fueled increased output and improved efficiency across the entire business, thus enabling us to better serve our customers. \u2047 Continuing with this approach as a foundation of our strategy, we are well positioned to address the needs of healthcare for years to come based on our strong value proposition. \u2047 Accordingly, I am pleased to state that we expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3 to $3.50. \u2047 Today, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as the key drivers for our better-than-expected quarterly and annual performance. \u2047 Later in my remarks, I'll share details regarding our expectations for 2021. \u2047 Clearly, we finished 2020 in a very strong fashion, with good revenue growth in the fourth quarter and exceptional increases in operating income and earnings per share. \u2047 I'll elaborate on each of these next. \u2047 For the quarter, revenue was $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year. \u2047 This represents 8% growth and was driven by greater sales of PPE across both segments as well as growth in sales in our home healthcare business line and stabilization of the Medical Distribution business. \u2047 Elective procedures were better than expected, but overall continue to trail pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 16.9%, an improvement of 390 basis points over prior year as a result of higher-margin sales from our Global Products segment, driven by continuing PPE demand as well as an improved operating efficiency. \u2047 For the full year, gross margin was up 285 basis points to 15.1%. \u2047 Distribution, selling and administrative expense of $283 million in the current quarter was $29 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of top line growth and ongoing investments across all business lines, net of productivity gains. \u2047 Interest expense of $17 million in the fourth quarter was down 23% or $5 million versus the same period in the prior year. \u2047 For the full year, interest expense was lower by 15% or $15 million. \u2047 These improvements are the result of continued reduction in debt, along with lower base rates and utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program. \u2047 Our strong execution in serving our customers, along with very high demand for PPE, growth in home healthcare and productivity gains across the company, led to very strong bottom line results. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter was $51 million or $0.72 a share, and $88 million or $1.39 per share for the full year. \u2047 Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter was $80 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $1.14, about a fivefold increase compared to the prior year. \u2047 For the full year, adjusted income from continuing operations was $144 million, which equates to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.26, a significant increase from the $0.62 in 2019. \u2047 Foreign currency impact on earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.06 favorable, and for full year 2020, it was $0.08 favorable. \u2047 Next, I'll discuss our fourth quarter highlights by segment. \u2047 Global Solutions revenue was $1.95 billion compared to $1.94 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 This slight increase in revenue was due to growth in our home healthcare business, coupled with higher levels of PPE sold through Medical Distribution, partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on elective procedures versus the prior year. \u2047 The typical seasonal growth in this segment was muted by the pandemic. \u2047 Operating income for the segment was $22 million compared to $19 million last year. \u2047 Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, growth in home healthcare and our productivity and efficiency gains helped drive nice growth in bottom line operating results, particularly in the back half of the year. \u2047 In our Global Products segment, net revenue in the fourth quarter was $575 million compared to $363 million last year, an increase of 58%, which was driven by growth in volume of PPE sales, slightly offset by the impact of lower elective procedures. \u2047 Global Products operating income for the quarter was $100 million, more than a fourfold increase versus the $22 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. \u2047 Higher revenue through capacity expansions for PPE products, productivity initiatives, favorable product mix and improved fixed cost leverage, as we ramped up production throughout the year, all contributed to the very strong improvement in performance. \u2047 Foreign currency impact was favorable on a year-over-year basis by $5.4 million. \u2047 Moving now to cash flow, the balance sheet and capital structure. \u2047 In the quarter, we generated $71 million of operating cash flow. \u2047 And for the full year, we generated $339 million of operating cash flow, which was more than two times the prior year. \u2047 Increased profitability and disciplined working capital management were the primary drivers of the progress in this area. \u2047 The strong cash flow was achieved despite our investment in a seasonal inventory build to ensure continuity of supply for our customers. \u2047 We expect cash flow to continue to be strong in 2021. \u2047 During the course of 2020, we accomplished several milestones in our financial strategy. \u2047 We strategically divested Movianto for $133 million to remain focused on our core assets and used the proceeds from the sale to pay down debt. \u2047 We entered into"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $1.14.  \u2047  q4 gaap earnings per share $0.72.  \u2047  expects adjusted net income for 2021 to
