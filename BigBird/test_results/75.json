{"article": ["During our call today, unless otherwise stated, we're comparing results to the same period in 2020. \u2047 Future dividend payments and share repurchases remain subject to the discretion of Altria's board. \u2047 Altria reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \u2047 Today's call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. \u2047 Adjusted results exclude special items that affect comparisons with reported results. \u2047 Finally, all references in today's remarks to tobacco consumers or consumers within a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older. \u2047 In the third quarter, Altria continued to balance maximizing profitability from our core tobacco businesses with investing to realize a vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future. \u2047 Our tobacco business has performed well against difficult year-over-year comparisons, and we are encouraged by the significant retail share growth from on! \u2047 in the third quarter. \u2047 We also continue to reward shareholders with a strong and growing dividend and announced today the expansion of our share repurchase program to $3.5 billion. \u2047 Both Altria and the tobacco industry are evolving and with transformation comes opportunity. \u2047 It also brings uncertainty and adversity, including the recently International Trade Commission decision related to IQOS. \u2047 We knew our journey to a smoke-free future would not be easy, but our determined and talented employees have demonstrated they are up to the challenge. \u2047 The pursuit of our vision is not based on a single brand or product platform. \u2047 Our vision is built on our understanding of tobacco consumers, their capabilities as a leading tobacco company and a portfolio of smoke-free brands and product formats. \u2047 We make progress through the performance of our current smoke-free portfolio and advancements in regulatory sciences, data analytics and a robust consumer engagement system. \u2047 Our tobacco businesses remain strong, and our vision keeps us focused and guides us forward. \u2047 Let's now turn to our business results. \u2047 Altria grew its third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share, 2.5% despite a backdrop of challenging comparisons and unfavorable year-over-year trade inventory movement. \u2047 For the first nine months of the year, adjusted earnings per share grew 4.5%, primarily driven by the strong financial performance of our tobacco businesses and higher ABI adjusted earnings. \u2047 Our smokeable products segment continues to generate significant cash and return -- return to shareholders in fuel or vision. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted operating company's income decreased 2.2%, reflecting the impact of trade inventory swings, but grew 2.6% to $7.9 billion for the first nine months, while Marlboro remained strong. \u2047 The oral tobacco product segment continued to deliver robust profit margins, while Copenhagen maintained its leadership position. \u2047 In all nicotine pouches, we have accelerated investment behind Helix and believe that the on! \u2047 portfolio is well positioned in this fast-growing category. \u2047 We're advancing the sophistication of our analytics across our companies. \u2047 The Helix team uses this capability to evaluate the impact of promotional tools on tobacco consumers and understand what actions effectively drive trial, repeat purchase and adoption. \u2047 retail share of oral tobacco increased a full share point sequentially, reaching 3 share points for the third quarter and nearly tripling since the end of last year. \u2047 These strong results were driven by increased smoker trial and repeat purchase from existing on! \u2047 We're excited by the performance of on! \u2047 during the first nine months of the year and believe consumer insights, disruptive retail executions and consumer engagement will continue to fuel its growth. \u2047 Last year, we submitted premarket tobacco applications to the FDA for the entire on! \u2047 While the FDA has made substantial progress in reviewing millions of PMTAs they received, our applications for on! \u2047 A week ago, the FDA authorized the marketing of four of our oral nicotine products, Verve discs and Verve chews in the flavors of green mint and blue mint and determined that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health. \u2047 This is the first flavored product authorization issued by the FDA for newly deemed tobacco products. \u2047 While our Verve products are not currently in market, we believe the learnings we gained from developing our Verve submission were critical in filing compelling and timely submissions for on! \u2047 , which we completed in only nine months after closing the on! \u2047 We're also actively working on modified risk product applications for on! \u2047 We believe an MRTP would be an impactful point of differentiation for the brand and an important tool in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products. \u2047 In e-vapor, we estimate that the total category volume increased 17% versus the year ago period and increased 2% sequentially as a result of continued elevated levels of competitive activity. \u2047 While we had hoped for clarity on the category's outlook as manufacturers receive PMTA decisions, the future of e-vapor is still uncertain. \u2047 For most of the leading e-vapor products, the applications are still pending, including those submitted by JUUL. \u2047 Moving forward, we expect e-vapor volume trends to be influenced by regulatory activity, which has the potential to impact the degree of cross-category movement. \u2047 Recently, the CDC published an update from their National Youth Tobacco Survey. \u2047 While caution is warranted when comparing results year-over-year due to the impact of the pandemic on the surveys methodology, underage e-vapor use, including use of JUUL, shows continued signs of decline. \u2047 We're encouraged by the progress, but more still needs to be done, and we remain committed to continuing our work to drive down underage use. \u2047 Turning to heated tobacco. \u2047 The IQOS team continued to refine its go-to-market approach for new and innovative products. \u2047 Across the four states where IQOS is available, total Marlboro HeatSticks volume continue to grow, with repeat purchase accounting for approximately 85% of sales. \u2047 According to IQOS consumers, our IQOS experts program played a significant role in their repeat purchases. \u2047 The program offers smokers personalized support and encouragement through consistent tailored engagements. \u2047 In the Northern Virginia lead market device penetrations as a percent of the smoker population continue to exceed the performance of previous rollouts. \u2047 In the last four weeks of the third quarter, Marlboro HeatSticks achieved a cigarette category retail share of 1.8% in Northern Virginia stores with distributions. \u2047 As we mentioned earlier, the International Trade Commission recently imposed an importation ban and issued season desist orders on IQOS, Marlboro HeatSticks and infringing components. \u2047 We're disappointed in this decision as IQOS is the only inhalable tobacco product to have received FDA authorization as a modified risk tobacco product. \u2047 The ITC's importation ban will make the product unavailable for all consumers have switched to IQOS, reduce the options for over 20 million smokers looking for alternatives to cigarettes and ultimately is detrimental to public health. \u2047 We continue to believe the plaintiff's patents are invalid and that IQOS does not infringe on those patents. \u2047 The ITC's decision is currently under 60-day review by the administration's U.S. Trade Representative. \u2047 In the event that the administration does not reject the decision, we're preparing to comply with the order. \u2047 We've been focused on our contingency plans surrounding sales and distribution and have been in communication with PMI on their domestic manufacturing plans. \u2047 We view the ITC's decision as a frustrating obstacle, but we are not deterred from the work required to realize our vision. \u2047 We remain committed to the heated tobacco category and believe it can play an important role in transitioning smokers to a smoke-free future. \u2047 Going forward, we expect to apply the knowledge and capabilities we gained from introducing and responsibly marketing a brand-new product category. \u2047 For example, we've learned how to blend behavioral science, data insights and consumer engagement to support smokers on their smoke-free journey, leverage MRTPs to educate consumers on the benefits of reduced risk products and establish a robust post-market surveillance system as required to monitor FDA-authorized products. \u2047 I'm optimistic about the future for tobacco harm reduction in the U.S. \u2047 We have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation. \u2047 Let's turn to our financial outlook. \u2047 We're raising the lower end of our full year 2021 guidance and now expect to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $4.58 to $4.62. \u2047 This range represents a growth rate of 5% to 6% from a $4.36 base in 2020. \u2047 They bring significant combined expertise in operations, business strategy, consumer insights, and public policy and will be tremendous assets as we pursue our vision. \u2047 I'd like to begin by discussing the macroeconomic factors we believe influence the tobacco consumer. \u2047 We believe rising gas prices, inflation and the conclusion of COVID-19 relief programs led to a decrease in disposable income versus the previous quarter. \u2047 In addition, increased consumer mobility offer consumers more options for their discretionary spending. \u2047 At retail, trends were unchanged sequentially. \u2047 We estimate that compared to pre-pandemic levels, the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continue to be depressed, but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated. \u2047 We continue to monitor tobacco consumer behaviors and will provide our insights on the factors impacting those behaviors as we move forward. \u2047 Moving to our businesses. \u2047 The smokable products segment expanded its adjusted OCI margins to 58%, an increase of 0.5 percentage point for the third quarter and more than 1 percentage point for the first nine months. \u2047 This performance was supported by strong net price realization of 11.3% in the third quarter and 9.2% for the first nine months. \u2047 Smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 12.9% in the third quarter and 8% in the first nine months. \u2047 We believe reported volumes reflect an absolute wholesale inventory swing of 1.5 billion sticks as wholesalers build inventory in the third quarter of last year, but depleted inventories this quarter. \u2047 When adjusted for trade inventory movement, calendar differences and other factors, domestic cigarette volumes for the third quarter and first nine months declined by an estimated 7% and 5%, respectively. \u2047 At the industry level, we estimate that adjusted domestic cigarette volumes declined by 6.5% in the third quarter and by 5% in the first nine months. \u2047 Marlboro remains strong and resilient despite a widening price gap in a dynamic macroeconomic environment. \u2047 In the third quarter, Marlboro retail share of the total cigarette category was unchanged, both sequentially and versus the year ago period at 43.2%. \u2047 And in discount, total segment retail share in the third quarter continued to fluctuate, increasing 0.3 percentage points sequentially to 25.3%. \u2047 In cigars, we continue to believe Black & Mild is the most profitable brand in the large mass machine-made cigar category. \u2047 Reported cigar shipment volume increased by 2.7% in the first nine months of 2021. \u2047 Turning to the oral tobacco products segment. \u2047 Adjusted OCI and adjusted OCI margins contracted for the third quarter and first nine months primarily due to increased spending behind on! \u2047 and shifting mix between MST and oral nicotine pouches. \u2047 We're pleased with the strong overall margins for the segment and continue to be excited about the opportunity for on! \u2047 in the oral nicotine pouch category. \u2047 Total reported oral tobacco products segment volume decreased by 3.8% for the third quarter and by 0.5% for the first nine months. \u2047 When adjusted for trade inventory movement in calendar differences, segment volume decreased by an estimated 2.5% for the third quarter and 0.5% for the first nine months. \u2047 Oral tobacco products segment retail share for the third quarter was sequentially unchanged as strong share gains for on! \u2047 offset declines in MST. The segment declined 2.2 percentage points versus the third quarter last year due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category. \u2047 Looking ahead, we're monitoring several factors as we move toward the end of this year and into the next. \u2047 Many industries are experiencing rising input costs and supply chain disruptions. \u2047 For Altria, we foresee modest inflation in the year ahead. \u2047 This could have some impact on the input costs and the inflation adjustment to our Master Settlement Agreement payments. \u2047 However, our tobacco businesses remain strong, and we are confident in our ability to manage through short-term economic challenges. \u2047 As a reminder, we contemplate an array of scenarios in our financial forecast and intend to incorporate these factors into our 2022 earnings per share guidance, which we expect to provide in January. \u2047 Turning to our investment in ABI. \u2047 The five-year lockup on our restricted shares expired earlier this month. \u2047 We've been an investor in the beer category since 1970 and our original investment of $230 million has served us extremely well over the past half century. \u2047 In fact, since 2003, our beer investment has served as a diverse income stream that contributed over $12 billion of adjusted equity earnings, contributed over $10 billion of cash from both dividends and 2016 merger proceeds and strengthened our balance sheet. \u2047 We've performed rigorous analyses regarding the ABI investment. \u2047 First, as part of the preparation of our third quarter financial statements; and second, in anticipation of the expiration of the lockup. \u2047 In preparing our third quarter financials, we assessed the latest outlook for ABI's business under the applicable accounting guidance and recorded an impairment to the asset. \u2047 While we continue to believe ABI's share price will recover, we now do not expect it to fully recover to its carrying value as soon as previously expected. \u2047 As a result, we have written our investment in ABI down to its September 30 market value of $11.2 billion. \u2047 Regarding our decisions around the lockup, we view our ABI stake as a financial investment, and our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the investment for our shareholders. \u2047 We consider several factors as we analyze the investment, including the strategic rationale of continuing as a long-term investor in the beer category. \u2047 ABI's share price, which has declined by more than 30% since October 2019, due in large part to impacts of the COVID pandemic. \u2047 Our expectations of ABI's business, alternative uses of capital and tax considerations. \u2047 We have determined that selling our ABI investment at this time would not maximize long-term shareholder value. \u2047 Therefore, we continue to plan to maintain our ABI investment. \u2047 We continue to have confidence in ABI's long-term strategies, premium global brands, experienced management team and capability to successfully navigate near-term challenges. \u2047 We will continue to monitor and evaluate market conditions and the analytical factors mentioned previously on a regular basis, consistent with our goal of maximizing the long-term value of"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly total cigarette shipment volumes $24.05 billion (not $24.50 billion), down 12.9%.  \u2047  raises fy adjusted earnings per share view to $4.58 to $4.62.  \u2047  narrows its 2021 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share (eps) guidance.  \u2047  altria narrows its guidance for 2021 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $4.58 to $4.62.  \u2047  altria group -continue to monitor impact of covid-19 on juul \u2047 s business, including near-term supply chain constraints and component part shortages.  \u2047  altria group - during 2020 and the first nine months of 2021, cronos has been adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3 adjusted earnings per share $4.58.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share $4.58.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share $4.58."]}
