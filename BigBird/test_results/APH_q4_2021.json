{"article": ["These statements reflect the participants' expectations as of today, but actual results could be different. \u2047 Participants also expect to refer to certain adjusted financial measures during the call. \u2047 A very strong holiday season concluded an outstanding year. \u2047 Throughout fiscal '22, we accelerated our recovery from the pandemic and delivered record results for our footwear companies even as we navigated a number of acute challenges. \u2047 Despite multiple COVID variants, bottlenecks across the supply chain, labor shortages, and higher costs, we capitalized on the opportunity of a strong consumer spending environment to drive our business forward. \u2047 Our exceptional results underscore the earnings power of our business model, the solid foundation for growth we built through the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, and the successful execution of our footwear-focused strategy. \u2047 There are several key achievements that defined the year. \u2047 We grew revenue more than 35% over last year and 10% over fiscal '20. \u2047 Gross margin expansion and meaningful expense leverage drove record operating income for our footwear businesses as we achieved an operating margin above 6%. \u2047 We generated $240 million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $80 million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to 9% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $7.62, an increase of more than 65% over fiscal '20. \u2047 Additional highlights include capitalizing on the accelerated shift to online spending and holding on to last year's almost 75% gain to reach almost $0.5 billion of digital sales, growing our branded wholesale business by almost $90 million versus two years ago, while improving profitability, adding new licenses and strengthening retail partnerships, and increasing store revenues over 40% from last year and nearly achieving fiscal '20 levels despite having 55 fewer stores. \u2047 Overall, our results highlight the work we've done to create and curate leading footwear brands and importantly, to strengthen our position as the leading destination for teen and youth-branded fashion footwear. \u2047 In today's channel-less world, where the consumer can truly shop anywhere, Journeys' and Schuh's growth underscores the tremendous loyalty developed with existing customers and compelling proposition offered to new customers. \u2047 Teens view us as the unparalleled fashion authority, choosing fashion-right brands and styles, validating whatever brands we're currently selling, and they are increasingly turning to our concept for their branded footwear needs. \u2047 We are not dependent on anyone brand for the majority of our revenue, but rather 10 or more brands typically constitute 80% of what we sell. \u2047 Trend-driven teens who are looking for the most current assortment of fashion footwear that is always evolving, whether they want to make a statement to stand out or want to fit in and be just like their friends, come to Journeys and Schuh to buy multiple brands and seek advice from our knowledgeable fashion advisor salespeople in our youth-focused full-service environment. \u2047 The effects from the pandemic on how consumers shop rather than harming our business was instead the catalyst to reach new heights. \u2047 Shifting now to the fourth quarter. \u2047 The work we did to have the right assortment and the right holiday marketing campaigns helped deliver Q4 results well ahead of expectations. \u2047 Consumer demand was robust, and we nonetheless believe our results would have been even stronger had we been able to maintain historic levels of inventory. \u2047 Our performance over last year's Q4 was driven by store sales and, versus two years ago, by digital and branded wholesale sales. \u2047 Q4 highlights include revenue up 14% over last year and 7% over two years ago. \u2047 Remarkably, we achieved this despite overall inventory being down almost 20% versus last year and down by one-third compared with the fourth quarter two years ago during the key holiday period. \u2047 With much more limited promotional activity, coupled with price increases, full-price selling was very strong, fueling a 300-plus basis point increase in gross margin versus last year, and a 200 basis point increase compared to two years ago, much stronger than expected. \u2047 Higher sales and this better-than-expected gross margin resulted in double-digit operating income expansion over pre-pandemic levels and record adjusted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of more than 25% compared to last year's holiday season and 13% compared to two years ago. \u2047 From a channel perspective, the power of our omnichannel strategy was on full display in the fourth quarter as consumer appetite to shop in person, especially in the days leading up to Christmas, drove an almost 20% increase in-store sales over the year-ago period. \u2047 Strong demand in stores with many items selling as soon as they hit the store floor meant less store inventory than usual was available to service online demand. \u2047 We saw the biggest shift to in-store shopping in the U.K. as Schuh stores were open 100% of the quarter compared to roughly only a third of the days last year. \u2047 Despite the strong in-store sales in both Journeys and Schuh, we held on to almost 90% of last year's digital sales in total. \u2047 So turning now to discuss each business. \u2047 I'll start with Journeys and begin with a huge congratulations to the team on setting all-time records of sales and operating profit for the year. \u2047 Journeys' performance underscores the competitive advantages the business has built and how it has leveraged those advantages to further separate itself as the destination for branded fashion footwear for teens. \u2047 All of Journeys' Top 10 brands experienced year-over-year growth in fiscal '22 with most notching significant gains. \u2047 The current fashion cycle, which I've been describing, is shifting more into casual away from fashion athletic, plays into Journeys' strength, positioning Journeys well among its competition to deliver this assortment. \u2047 In anticipation of continued supply chain pressure, we encouraged customers to shop early and they did and the holiday season got off to a very strong start. \u2047 At this peak volume time, as the season unfolded, while traffic remained solid, conversion, which had been robust, dropped off as Journeys was not able to quickly replenish in-demand products to match outsized holiday demand. \u2047 While Journeys' talented store teams drove sales above last year's level, selling whatever was available, we believe Journeys' sales would have been meaningfully higher had we been able to get the inventory receipts we had ordered. \u2047 As a positive, tight inventory led to unprecedented levels of full-price selling with customers also willing to absorb price increases to secure desired product, driving further margin acceleration. \u2047 Finally, the Journeys team continues to live its core values of being a family with an attitude that cares, partnering during the holidays with nonprofit candidates and customers at the register for its largest national community activation, and donating $600,000 for bikes for underserved youth across the United States. \u2047 As part of this initiative, Journeys' headquarters employees built and donated 300 bikes and helmets to two Nashville elementary schools just in time for the holidays. \u2047 We were incredibly pleased with holiday results as Schuh capitalized on pent-up consumer demand and delivered Q4 constant currency revenue up more than 30% versus last year and 12% versus two years ago. \u2047 Like Journeys, Schuh's strength is its ability to deliver the fashion brands desired by its youth consumer and Schuh drove a nice growth across its diversified mix of both casual and fashion athletic footwear. \u2047 As a result of its stellar execution throughout the pandemic, navigating multiple store openings and closings, and making the most of its advanced digital capabilities, Schuh garnered improved product access being moved up a tier by a number of its high-profile brands. \u2047 This step forward in access, coupled with less severe supply chain disruptions and strong inventory management allowed Schuh to be in a better inventory position over the holidays. \u2047 U.K. customers were more comfortable shopping in person, leading to better in-store traffic, Schuh retained much of its digital gains from when stores were closed last year, resulting in a Q4 46% digital penetration. \u2047 Lastly, less promotional activity and product mix also drove strong margin gains. \u2047 Turning now to our branded side. \u2047 Our plan to reimagine Johnston & Murphy for a more casual, more comfortable, post-pandemic environment continues to prove out in the marketplace with the biggest Q4 bottom-line gain over last year of all of our businesses. \u2047 J&M continues to expand its focus from not just the products consumers need for work, but the products people desire for everyday life. \u2047 Q4's strong sell-through in boots, casual and casual athletic footwear, and equally strong performance in apparel and outerwear demonstrates just how far we've come, making J&M an attractive multi-category lifestyle brand. \u2047 This pivot has included new strategies for how and where we reach our customers. \u2047 New product story marketing campaigns have been very effective, and we've seen the most growth in our digital channel, up 14% compared to Q4 last year, and growth in our under-35 customer base, up 30% in Q4. \u2047 Much stronger demand and supply constraints pushed inventory more than 50% below pre-pandemic levels, hampering our ability to capture all of the demand during the holidays and return J&M to pre-pandemic sales. \u2047 Nevertheless, we're excited about J&M's trajectory and expect upside in the year to come. \u2047 Rounding out the discussion, momentum for Licensed Brands accelerated as the year progressed, notching impressive sales growth of 70% over last year as we successfully turned around the business and capitalized on the new capabilities we obtained with the Togast acquisition. \u2047 While supply chain disruption and excess freight costs weighed on the P&L throughout the year, we saw growing demand for both Levi's and Dockers footwear in value and full-price channels, positioning the business for improved profitability as these challenges subside, and we continue to take advantage of the white space in the marketplace. \u2047 In conclusion, our footwear-focused strategy is delivering results. \u2047 COVID provided the real opportunity to transform our business at a more rapid rate. \u2047 We are a healthier company today and delivered growth and improved earnings as a result of higher digital sales and profits, a more profitable store channel, and growing branded wholesale sales. \u2047 Our future is bright as we build upon the progress we have made. \u2047 Turning now to the current year. \u2047 Fiscal '22 had headwinds I have discussed and also some unique tailwinds, namely: healthy consumer spending in the first half due to significant government stimulus; an unusually good environment for full price selling as a result of high demand and scarcity of supply; and we benefited from some onetime gains related to rent and government relief, mostly in the U.K. With respect to fiscal '23, sales have gotten off to a much stronger start versus last year, but a slower start versus pre-pandemic, driven largely by the lower inventory level and lagging tax refunds. \u2047 We are expecting year-over-year trends to moderate as we anniversary stimulus and the lack of inventory further pressures growth early in the new year, especially in the first quarter. \u2047 Looking further into fiscal '23, we're working hard to overcome the cost pressures that are prevalent today, and we don't anticipate the factors that led to such a strong full-price selling environment to be sustained. \u2047 Tom will provide the financial details of our outlook momentarily, but we feel confident about delivering topline growth on top of a very strong fiscal '22. \u2047 Consistent with what I have outlined, we are planning the back half to be much stronger than the first half as inventory levels improve, logistics cost pressure starts to ease, and continued price actions help offset higher costs. \u2047 Fiscal '23 will also be an investment year for J&M as we advance the work on the brand's repositioning. \u2047 We expect adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '23 to be between $7 and $7.75 and believe somewhere close to the middle of the range is where the year will land. \u2047 While there are a number of variables at play, our results over what has been a very volatile past 24 months gives me great confidence in our team's ability to execute. \u2047 Finally, our ESG program will achieve an important milestone early in the year with the completion of our inaugural enterprisewide carbon footprint assessment. \u2047 Our work continues to progress with more to come when we publish a comprehensive ESG report later this spring. \u2047 Throughout fiscal '22, our employees stepped up wherever needed, and I can't overstate how critical this work was to our success. \u2047 Companies succeed like we have because of strong teams and dedicated people who help them achieve new heights. \u2047 I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished together. \u2047 I would like to echo Mimi's remarks regarding the continued success of our key strategies and our amazing people. \u2047 With the year now behind us, we feel even more confident in our portfolio and the ability of our footwear-focused strategy to drive strong results. \u2047 Throughout the year, we saw continued strength in all our businesses, culminating in a strong Q4, which was driven by our team's ability to execute the strategies put in place. \u2047 Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to again remind you as we have done throughout the year that we believe comparing to our pre-pandemic fiscal year '20, two years ago, typically provides the more difficult and often most meaningful assessment of our business. \u2047 However, when comparing to fiscal year '20, keep in mind how our strategy has changed our business. \u2047 E-commerce has become a larger percentage of sales along with wholesale sales for licensed brands. \u2047 These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expenses and the expansion of our wholesale volume. \u2047 However, this should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses. \u2047 While these changes are reshaping the P&L, they have a net positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital-intensive business model. \u2047 Turning now to the specifics for the quarter. \u2047 Consolidated revenue was $728 million, up 7% compared to fiscal '20. \u2047 Journeys grew 2%, while Schuh grew 12% on a constant currency basis, and we more than tripled our licensed brands business. \u2047 As for J&M, the quarter started off strong in November, but supply chain challenges led to a significant lack of inventory, which led to J&M sales being down 12% for the quarter. \u2047 From a channel perspective, we experienced increases in both the e-com and wholesale channels. \u2047 And while we drove robust growth in the store channel, sales remained 4% below fiscal year '20, as scarcity of inventory impeded sales. \u2047 Worth noting as well is that we ended the quarter with 55
