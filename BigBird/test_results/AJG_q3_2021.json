{"article": ["We had a fantastic third quarter. \u2047 For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 17% growth in revenue, 10% organic growth and nearly 11% organic if you control for last year's large life sale that we've discussed frequently. \u2047 Net earnings growth of 22%, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 13%. \u2047 And we completed five new mergers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date closed merger count to 19, representing nearly $200 million of annualized revenue. \u2047 And if you add in the pending Willis Reinsurance merger, that number would be pushing $1 billion. \u2047 So the team continues to execute at a very high level, growing organically, growing through acquisitions, improving our productivity, raising our quality and, most importantly, constantly building upon our unique Gallagher culture. \u2047 A terrific quarter on all measures. \u2047 Let me provide a brief update on our agreement to purchase Willis Re. \u2047 On the regulatory approval front, we received competition clearance in five of six jurisdictions required to close, including clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice. \u2047 The final jurisdiction in the U.K. where the CMA is reviewing the transaction, that's the final jurisdiction. \u2047 That review is ongoing, but we believe we're in good shape. \u2047 Although there is still work to be done, at this point, we believe we're on track for a fourth quarter closing. \u2047 On the integration front, hundreds of Gallagher and Willis Re professionals are hard at work, ensuring we will be well positioned to service our clients when we close. \u2047 Our 40-year acquisition history allows us to leverage our proven M&A integration path. \u2047 Integration is in our DNA. \u2047 We're looking forward to welcoming 2,200 new colleagues to Gallagher as a family of professionals this holiday season. \u2047 It's really exciting to think about all the talent and expertise that will be joining us. \u2047 It's going to be incredible for our combined organization and our clients. \u2047 Back to our quarterly results, starting with the Brokerage segment. \u2047 Reported revenue growth was excellent at 16%. \u2047 Of that, 9% was organic revenue growth, at the upper end of our September IR Day expectation and nearly 10% controlling for last year's large life product sale. \u2047 Net earnings growth was 23%, and we grew our adjusted EBITDAC 13%. \u2047 Doug will provide some comments on third quarter margin and our fourth quarter outlook, but needless to say, another excellent quarter from the Brokerage team. \u2047 Let me walk you around the world and break down our organic by geography, starting with our P/C operations. \u2047 First, our domestic retail operations were very strong with more than 10% organic. \u2047 Results were driven by good new business combined with higher exposures and continued rate increases. \u2047 Risk Placement Services, our domestic wholesale operations, grew 16%. \u2047 This includes more than 30% organic in open brokerage and 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. \u2047 New business and retention were both up a point or so relative to 2020 levels. \u2047 Outside the U.S., our U.K. operations posted more than 9% organic. \u2047 Specialty was 12%, and retail was a solid 6%, both supported by excellent new business production. \u2047 Australia and New Zealand combined grew more than 6%, also benefiting from good new business. \u2047 And finally, Canada was up nearly 10% on the back of double-digit new business and stable retention. \u2047 Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. \u2047 Third quarter organic was up about 5%, in line with our September IR Day commentary. \u2047 Controlling for last year's large life insurance product sale, organic would have been up high single digits and represents a really nice step-up from the 4% organic we reported for the second quarter and a 2% organic for the first. \u2047 So we're experiencing positive revenue momentum and really encouraging sign for the remainder of the year and 2022. \u2047 So total Brokerage segment organic solidly in that 9% to 10% range, simply an excellent quarter. \u2047 Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the P/C market. \u2047 Global P/C rates remain firm overall, and pricing is positive in nearly all product lines. \u2047 Overall third quarter renewal premium increases were about 8% and similar to increases during the first half of this year. \u2047 Moving around the world, U.S. retail premium was up about 8%, including nearly 10% increases in casualty and professional liability. \u2047 Even workers' comp was up around 5%. \u2047 In Canada, premium was up about 9%, driven by double-digit increases in professional liability and casualty. \u2047 Australia and New Zealand combined up 3% to 4%. \u2047 And U.K. retail was up about 7% with double-digit increases in professional liability, while commercial auto was closer to flat. \u2047 Finally, within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premiums were up more than 10% and binding operations were up 5%. \u2047 Additionally, improved economic activity, even despite the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions, are leading to positive policy endorsements and other favorable midterm policy adjustments as our customers add coverages and exposures to their existing policies. \u2047 So premiums are still increasing almost everywhere. \u2047 As we look ahead over the coming quarters, I see the P/C market remaining difficult with rate increases persisting for quite a while. \u2047 In the near term, we don't see any meaningful changes in carrier underwriting appetite capacity, attachment points or terms and conditions. \u2047 Long term, markets do not appear to be seeing a slowdown in rising loss costs. \u2047 Global third quarter natural catastrophe losses, likely in excess of $40 billion, increased cyber incidences, social inflation, replacement cost inflation and supply chain disruptions. \u2047 And all of this is before factoring in further increases in claim frequency as global economies recover and become even more robust. \u2047 All of these factors, combined with low investment returns, suggest that carriers will continue to push for rate. \u2047 I just don't see a dramatic change for the foreseeable future. \u2047 So it's still a very difficult and even hard in many spots global P/C environment. \u2047 But remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases through our creativity, expertise and market relationships. \u2047 As we think about the environment for our employee benefits, the improved business activity, lower unemployment and increased demand for our consulting services is driving more revenue opportunities. \u2047 And our customers and prospects continue to rapidly shift away from expense control strategies to plans and tactics that will help them grow their business. \u2047 And with rebounding covered lives in one of the most challenging labor markets in memory, our consulting businesses are extremely well positioned to deliver creative solutions to our clients. \u2047 So as I sit here today, I think fourth quarter Brokerage segment organic will be similar to the third quarter, and that could take full year 2021 organic toward 8%. \u2047 That would be a really nice improvement from the 3.2% organic we reported in 2020. \u2047 To put that in perspective, 8% would be our best full year Brokerage segment organic growth in nearly two decades, and we think 2022 organic will end up in a very similar range. \u2047 Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. \u2047 I mentioned earlier we completed five brokerage mergers during the quarter, representing about $16 million of estimated annualized revenues. \u2047 As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 50 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $400 million of annualized revenues. \u2047 So even without the reinsurance merger, it's looking like we will finish 2021 strong, wrapping up another successful year for our merger strategy. \u2047 Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. \u2047 Third quarter organic growth was 16.6%, even better than our September IR Day expectation. \u2047 Margins were strong, too. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDAC margin once again came in above 19%. \u2047 Results continue to benefit from late 2020 and early 2021 new business wins, in addition to further improvement in new arising claims within general liability and core workers' compensation. \u2047 Just an exceptional quarter from the team. \u2047 Looking forward, while our fourth quarter comparison is somewhat more challenging, the recovering global economy, improving employment situation and excellent new business production should result in fourth quarter organic over 10%. \u2047 That puts us on track for double-digit full year organic and an EBITDAC margin nicely above 19%. \u2047 As I look back over the last nine months, I can't help but to be really impressed with our team and our accomplishments. \u2047 Our commitment to our clients and to each other is evident in our successes, and that is due to our unique Gallagher culture. \u2047 In these challenging times, our clients are continuing to count on us, and I'm proud of our team's unwavering client focus. \u2047 Gallagher's unique culture is founded on the values in The Gallagher Way. \u2047 Those values have kept us on a steady course throughout the pandemic. \u2047 And time and time again, during these past months, our clients have shared their trust and appreciation for the value Gallagher brings to the table. \u2047 It comes down to talented individuals tapping into the power of our expertise across the globe, working together during this ongoing pandemic to continue to deliver for our clients. \u2047 That's The Gallagher Way, and it's the backbone of who we are as an organization. \u2047 As Pat said, a fantastic third quarter. \u2047 Then I'll walk you through our CFO commentary document, and finish up with my typical comments on cash, liquidity and capital management. \u2047 Headline all-in organic of 9%, outstanding in itself, but as Pat said, really running closer to 10% due to last year's life sale. \u2047 Either way, a nice step-up from the 6% we posted in the first quarter and the 6.8% in the second. \u2047 As we sit now, I'm seeing a fourth quarter organic again pushing that double-digit level. \u2047 Turning now to Page six to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. \u2047 Underlying margin after controlling for the life sale was around 160 basis points. \u2047 Let me take you through the math to get you to that. \u2047 First, headline margins were down 48 basis points, right about where we forecasted at our September IR day. \u2047 So controlling for the large life sale would bring us back to flat. \u2047 Second, in September, we forecasted about $25 million of expenses returning into our structure as we emerge from the pandemic and a small amount of performance comp time. \u2047 Recall, expenses returning mostly relate to higher utilization of our self-insured medical plans, resumption of advertising costs, more use of consultants, merit increases and a small pickup in T&E expenses. \u2047 We came in right on that forecast. \u2047 So controlling for these expenses also brings you to that underlying margin expansion of about 160 basis points. \u2047 That feels about right on organic in that 9% to 10% range. \u2047 Looking forward, we think about $30 million of our pandemic period expense savings return in the fourth quarter. \u2047 And if you assume, say, 9% organic, math would say we should show 90 to 100 basis points of expansion here in the fourth quarter. \u2047 So in the end, the headline story is that we have a really decent chance at growing our full year '21 margins by nearly 150 basis points. \u2047 And that's even growing over the life sale and the return of costs as we come out of the pandemic. \u2047 Add that to expanding margins over 400 basis points last year means we'd be growing margins more than 550 basis points over two years. \u2047 That really demonstrates the embedded improvements in how we do business. \u2047 No matter how you look at it, it's simply outstanding work by the team. \u2047 Moving to the Risk Management segment EBITDAC table on Page 7. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.5% in the quarter is an excellent result. \u2047 Year-to-date, our margins are at 19.2%, which underscores our ability to maintain a large portion of our pandemic period savings. \u2047 Looking forward, we think we can hold margins above 19% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. \u2047 That would result in about 100 basis points of margin expansion relative to 2020, another fantastic margin story. \u2047 Now let's shift to our CFO commentary document we posted on our IR website, starting on Page 4. \u2047 You'll see most of the third quarter items are close to our September IR Day estimates. \u2047 One small exception is Brokerage segment amortization expense, about $3 million below our September IR Day estimate. \u2047 It's simply because we finalized our valuation work on a recent '21 acquisition, which causes a small catch-up estimate change. \u2047 Flipping to Page five in the Corporate segment table. \u2047 Sharing actual third quarter results in the blue section to our September IR estimates in gray. \u2047 Interest and banking line on a reported and adjusted basis were both in line. \u2047 The non-GAAP adjustment here is that $12 million charge related to the early extinguishment of debt that we issued in May related to the terminated Aon and Willis remedy package. \u2047 Acquisition cost line, mostly related to the Willis Re transaction, came in a bit higher than our IR Day estimate on a reported basis, but in line on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. \u2047 We will see some additional transaction-related costs here in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Should have a sense of what those costs might be at our December IR Day. \u2047 Again, we plan on presenting these costs as a non-GAAP adjustment as well. \u2047 On the corporate cost line, in line on an adjusted basis after controlling for $5 million of a onetime permanent tax item, that's a noncash and it's simply a small valuation allowance related to a couple of international M&A transactions. \u2047 And finally, clean energy. \u2047 We are increasing our full year net earnings range to $87 million to $95 million on the back of the third quarter upside. \u2047 As for cash and capital management and M&A. \u2047 As you heard Pat say, we have a strong pipeline of tuck-in merger opportunities, and that's on top of the Willis Re acquisition that we hope to close here in the fourth quarter. \u2047 At September 30, cash on hand was about $2.7 billion, and we have no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. \u2047 We plan to use that cash, cash flow generated during the fourth quarter and our line of credit to fund our -- the acquisition of Willis Re. \u2047 Our Brokerage and Risk Management segments combined have produced 15% growth in revenue, nearly 8% organic growth. \u2047 We completed 19 new mergers this year with nearly $200 million investment made at annualized revenue. \u2047 Net earnings margin expanded 81 basis points. \u2047 A"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly total revenues $2,138.2 million versus $1,849.1 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts qtrly adjusted earnings per share $0.32.
