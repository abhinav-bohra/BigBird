{"article": ["I'm Amir Rozwadowski, head of investor relations for AT&T. \u2047 Joining me on the call today are John Stankey, our CEO, and Pascal Desroches, our CFO. \u2047 Before we begin, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement. \u2047 Results may differ materially. \u2047 Additional information is available on the Investor Relations website. \u2047 And as always, our earnings materials are on our website. \u2047 In addition, the FCC Spectrum Auction 110 results have been announced, but we're still in the quiet period, so we're limited in what we can say. \u2047 I hope you're all doing well, and a belated happy new year to all of you. \u2047 1.5 years ago, we began simplifying our business strategy to reposition AT&T for growth. \u2047 As you can imagine, this was a significant undertaking requiring us to not only focus our operational efforts toward growing customers, but also doing so in a manner that set us up for an improved profit trajectory in the coming years. \u2047 Simultaneously, we took on the task of structuring our communications, video, and media businesses in a manner that ensures their future success with the right capital structures, access to capital, and most importantly, the ability to drive better returns in a manner consistent with their respective market opportunities. \u2047 I'm pleased with the results our teams delivered last quarter, last year, and for the last six quarters while this repositioning was underway. \u2047 We finished last year with strong momentum in growing customer relationships, achieving outstanding yearly subscriber growth across Mobility, fiber, and HBO Max. \u2047 In Mobility, strong network performance and a consistent go-to-market strategy helped us lead the industry with about 3.2 million postpaid phone net adds. \u2047 That's more customers than we added in the prior 10 years combined. \u2047 We achieved this growth the right way with full year Mobility EBITDA up about $1 billion. \u2047 In fiber, we ended the year with a great build velocity, passing more than 2.6 million additional customer locations. \u2047 We added more than one million fiber subscribers for the fourth consecutive year, and full year broadband revenues were up 6.5% as we returned our Consumer Wireline business to revenue growth. \u2047 We also surpassed our high-end guidance for global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, adding 13.1 million subscribers in 2021, more than any year in HBO's history. \u2047 HBO Max and HBO now reaches a base of 73.8 million subscribers globally. \u2047 WarnerMedia is well positioned as a dynamic global business. \u2047 In addition to growing customer relationships, we also continue to make great progress in repositioning our operations to be more effective and efficient. \u2047 We achieved more than half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target, which we've reinvested into operations supporting our growth. \u2047 This includes simplifying and enhancing our customer experience, which has resulted in higher customer self-service, lower customer churn and greatly improved mobility NPS and industry-leading fiber NPS. \u2047 We also continue to rationalize our low-margin Business Wireline services as we reinvest savings into segments that support improving returns. \u2047 video assets in Vrio to our pending WarnerMedia transaction. \u2047 Together, these and other asset monetizations will generate more than $50 billion, and AT&T shareholders will own 71% of one of the world's foremost media companies in the new Warner Bros. \u2047 We also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow, nearly $27 billion in 2021, a number we feel good about when looking at our business after the WarnerMedia transaction. \u2047 So to summarize, we did what we said we were going to do last year. \u2047 I'm really proud of what our team has accomplished, and we're very pleased with the momentum we have. \u2047 Turning the page to this year, we'll be consistent in focusing on these same three operational and business priorities. \u2047 Now that our asset disposition initiatives are largely complete, I expect we'll take our execution to the next level. \u2047 To that end, we're encouraged with how the process for the WarnerMedia deal is progressing and now expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. \u2047 Going forward, we aim to be America's best broadband provider powered by 5G and fiber, and defined by greater ubiquity, reliability, capacity, and speed. \u2047 We're confident we can achieve that because in wireless, our focus will be continuing our subscriber momentum while increasing the pace of our 5G deployment. \u2047 We're confident in our ability to compete with 5G and our disciplined approach to selectively targeting and taking share in underpenetrated segments of the consumer and business marketplace. \u2047 While we're still in the quiet period, I can share that we're very pleased with the results of Spectrum Auction 110. \u2047 We received 40 megahertz of quality mid-band spectrum that we can begin to put into service this year, and we plan to efficiently deploy it with our C-band spectrum using just one tower climb. \u2047 We're on track to cover 200 million POPs using mid-band spectrum by the end of 2023. \u2047 And our network is only going to get better as we effectively deploy our new spectrum holdings. \u2047 In wired broadband, we have the fastest-growing fiber network and expect to capitalize on the expansion of our fiber footprint and accelerate subscriber growth. \u2047 The best-in-class experience we provide is getting even better with our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest Internet to AT&T fiber customers with symmetrical 2-gig and five-gig speed tiers. \u2047 This will truly differentiate how our customers experience the Internet. \u2047 Coming off an outstanding year with HBO Max, we plan to hand off the business with a strong exit velocity, and we look to further our international momentum and deliver more world-class content for viewers. \u2047 When the deal closes, the investments made in both content and HBO Max growth, coupled with strong execution by the team, will ensure Warner Bros. \u2047 Discovery is positioned as a leading global media company with the depth of content and the capabilities required to lead in the next era of media. \u2047 As we expand our customer base, we'll continue to responsibly remove costs from the business. \u2047 We have a clear line of sight to achieving more than two-thirds of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target by the end of this year. \u2047 And importantly, we expect the CD savings start to fall to our bottom line beginning in the back half of the year. \u2047 Our increased ability to reinvest in our business will fuel growth and allow us to deliver an even better customer experience as we further improve NPS and sustain low churn levels. \u2047 As we expand our fiber reach, we'll be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity and stabilize our Business Wireline unit by growing connectivity with small to midsized businesses. \u2047 We also plan to use our strong fiber and wireless asset base, broad distribution and converged product offers to strengthen our overall market position. \u2047 We're now at the dawn of a new age of connectivity where customers want more consolidated and integrated offers, and we're well positioned to meet that demand. \u2047 Our 5G network is already the best and most reliable. \u2047 And it will be enhanced by our accelerated fiber expansion in 5G spectrum deployment, a great reputation for advanced and reliable networking and our expertise to bring it all together for the customer. \u2047 We remain laser-focused on reducing debt, and we'll strengthen our balance sheet by using proceeds from the WarnerMedia transaction to achieve a 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2023. \u2047 We also expect to remain a top dividend-paying company after deal close, with a dividend payout in the $8 billion to $9 billion range where anywhere in that range should rank us among the best dividend yields in corporate America. \u2047 We're now in the middle innings of our transformation, and the momentum we have is real and sustainable. \u2047 We're well positioned post deal close to have a capital structure and balance sheet that puts us in an attractive position relative to our peers. \u2047 In addition, we believe it provides us with the financial flexibility to invest significantly in our business and the flexibility to pursue additional shareholder value creation initiatives over time. \u2047 We look forward to giving you more detail at our virtual analyst event, which we expect to host in March. \u2047 Slide 6 should look familiar. \u2047 As our pre-release earlier this month already indicated, we continue to deliver growth in postpaid phones, fiber, and HBO Max. \u2047 John just highlighted our full year results. \u2047 We're really pleased with them and expect the momentum we've built in 2021 to carry over to 2022. \u2047 Let's now take a look at our financial summary on Slide 7, starting with revenues. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was down 8% for the quarter on a comparable basis. \u2047 Growth in mobility was more than offset by a decline at WarnerMedia from the increased HBO Max investment, the new DIRECTV advertising channel arrangements, and lower contribution from basic networks. \u2047 Our consolidated operating income results continue to be impacted by certain retained costs from DIRECTV that are in the process of being rationalized. \u2047 Apart from WarnerMedia's contributions, our Communications segment EBITDA was up approximately 2% for the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.78. \u2047 In addition to merger amortization, adjustments for the quarter were made to exclude our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization and a gain in our benefit plan. \u2047 For the year, earnings per share was up nearly 7% with strong organic growth in mobility, lower interest, lower benefit costs, and higher investment gains. \u2047 We exceeded our free cash flow guidance for the year. \u2047 For the quarter, cash from operations was $11.3 billion, spending increase year over year with capex of $3.8 billion and gross capital investments totaling $4.9 billion. \u2047 Free cash flow for the quarter was $8.7 billion even with a year-over-year increase of $1.4 billion in capex. \u2047 For the full year, free cash flow was $26.8 billion despite an increase in capex of about $900 million and more than $4 billion in higher cash content costs. \u2047 Our total dividend payout ratio was about 56%. \u2047 This included cash distributions from DIRECTV of $1.9 billion. \u2047 Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communication business on Slide 8. \u2047 For the second consecutive quarter, our Communications segment grew both revenues and EBITDA. \u2047 A big part of that growth was driven by our increasing strength in mobility, which turned in another solid quarter. \u2047 Service revenues were up 4.6% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year driven by postpaid and prepaid subscriber gains. \u2047 Postpaid phone churn continues to run at low levels and in fact, hit a record low for the full year. \u2047 Our strong subscriber momentum continues with industry-leading postpaid phone growth. \u2047 Prepaid also continues to deliver impressive results with phone churn less than 3% and revenues up mid-single digits. \u2047 Cricket momentum continues with strong ad and phone churn substantially lower than 3%. \u2047 Mobility EBITDA was up more than $300 million, driven by growth in service revenues and transformation savings. \u2047 This growth comes without a material return to international roaming and with 3G shutdown costs of about $130 million during the quarter. \u2047 We remain on track to successfully shut down our 3G network next month and expect 3G shutdown impacts to peak in the first quarter of 2022 at about $250 million. \u2047 In addition, we expect another $100 million of expense in the first quarter associated with investment in our FirstNet operations and the completion of support funding for the CAF II program. \u2047 Business Wireline EBITDA margins continue to be stable as we rationalize our portfolio of low-margin products. \u2047 This rationalization process will continue in 2022. \u2047 And as we lap the beginning of this process, we should see improving revenue trends in Business Wireline in the latter part of 2022. \u2047 We believe we're really well positioned in the enterprise space. \u2047 And there is an interesting dynamic as public and private networking stock. \u2047 We have the account management infrastructure, the consulting expertise and the capabilities to support those businesses through that evolution as converged wireline and wireless solutions become the norm. \u2047 At the same time, we're energized by the opportunities that our fiber expansion creates in the small to midsized business segment, and we plan to be more active there going forward. \u2047 Turning to Consumer Wireline. \u2047 Our fiber customer growth and fiber network expansion continues. \u2047 And we continue to win share wherever we have fiber. \u2047 We added 271,000 fiber customers even in a traditionally slow fourth quarter. \u2047 And our fiber network continues to get even better with our new multi-gig speeds for AT&T fiber. \u2047 Driven by our strength in fiber, total Consumer Wireline revenues were up for the third consecutive quarter. \u2047 We had sequential EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Segment EBITDA did decline year over year due to a onetime pandemic-related benefit in last year's fourth quarter and higher network costs, including storms in the quarter. \u2047 Let's move to WarnerMedia's results, which are on Slide 9. \u2047 WarnerMedia revenues were up 15.4%, led by strong content licensing and D2C growth. \u2047 D2C subscription revenues grew 11%, reflecting continued success of HBO Max, partially offset by lower wholesale revenues related to the termination of our arrangement with Amazon at the end of the third quarter. \u2047 Content and other revenues were up 45%, reflecting higher TV licensing and theatrical releases. \u2047 Advertising revenues were down about 13% primarily due to lower audiences with tough comparison to the political environment in last year's fourth quarter. \u2047 Costs were up year over year due to a significant increase in programming and marketing, including the international launch costs for HBO Max. \u2047 Incremental HBO Max investments for the quarter was approximately $500 million. \u2047 The fourth quarter also included the impact of about $380 million in DIRECTV advertising revenue sharing cost. \u2047 We also launched some incredible content in the fourth quarter, including the premiere of the hit series And Just Like That and the third season of Succession. \u2047 With the production team operating close to full throttle, we expect peak content investment in 2022 with an even stronger release schedule, including Batman, Winning Time: The Rise of Lakers Dynasty and the highly anticipated Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon. \u2047 Now let's look at our 2022 guidance on Slide 11. \u2047 What we're showing you today is a full year view of our consolidated revenue outlook excluding DIRECTV and Vrio from both periods. \u2047 Our outlook does include a full year of expected results for WarnerMedia and Xandr. \u2047 We"], "gold_summary": ["at&t - qtrly
