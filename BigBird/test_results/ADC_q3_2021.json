{"article": ["This conference is being recorded. \u2047 I'll now introduce Webster's President and CEO, John Ciulla. \u2047 CFO, Glenn MacInnes and I will review business and financial performance for the quarter. \u2047 I will also provide some additional information on the line of business performance and COVID-19 related activities across the bank. \u2047 I hope that all of you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. \u2047 And I want to let those whose health has been impacted by the crisis know that the Webster Bank family has you in our thoughts. \u2047 The way our bankers have taken care of each other, our customers and communities over the last two months is truly amazing. \u2047 I'm so proud of the entire Webster team. \u2047 Webster Bank and the entire banking industry has rallied to be part of the solution to this health crisis and the resulting economic fallout. \u2047 Consistent with the way our values based organization has operated since our founding during the Great Depression in 1935. \u2047 We immediately took action at the outset of the pandemic to support our employees, customers and the communities we serve. \u2047 The safety of our employees was and is our number one priority. \u2047 We swiftly moved 80% of our workforce to remote or at-home work thereby creating a safer socially distance work setup in our buildings for those who need to be on-site to execute the central operations. \u2047 We modified branch activities and hours to ensure the safety of our employees and customers, while being available to meet our customers' needs. \u2047 This included moving to drive through an ATM service with bank lobbies open by appointment only. \u2047 We established a no-interest loan program for our employees whose families had been financially impacted by the pandemic. \u2047 We've paid all of our employees at 100% of pay, including those who are home because of illness, quarantine, higher health risk or to take care of loved ones or kids home because of school closures. \u2047 We've increased the daily pay of those bankers on the front line and have added PTO time to those workers as a future benefit. \u2047 We have not reduced our workforce by a single FTE during the crisis. \u2047 And we've augmented and expanded our employee assistance programs to support our employees during the pandemic. \u2047 For our customers, just as we led the banking industry with our foreclosure avoidance program during the Great Recession, we immediately placed a moratorium on residential mortgage foreclosures relating to Webster-owned mortgages. \u2047 We waived fees on early CD withdrawals. \u2047 We increased availability and amount of funds for withdrawal by our customers, and we've worked with our customers adversely impacted by COVID-19 through the modification of loans, the deferral of loan payments and through participation in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program and the Fed's Main Street Lending Program. \u2047 Here are some data points related to activities we've undertaken both as principal and what we've done through government programs. \u2047 As of April 16, we have modified over 2,000 units, representing $476 million of residential mortgages and home equities, that's approximately 6.5% of total home equity and mortgage balances, roughly 750 borrowers or $300 million of small business loans, representing approximately 17% of our small business portfolio outstandings, and over 300 borrowers and close to $1.6 billion of commercial loans or roughly 13% of the funded commercial loan portfolio. \u2047 With respect to the Paycheck Protection Program, we started accepting applications on day one, and despite technology and process challenges experienced by all banks, we were able to help many business clients in need. \u2047 When the SBA stopped accepting applications last Thursday, we had more than 2,000 SBA approved loans, representing approximately $650 million, most of which should be funded over the next week. \u2047 We've continued to process applications internally and will begin submitting those applications for approval when the SBA has additional funding and opens up the process, which it looks now like it will be later this week. \u2047 With respect to the Fed's Main Street Lending Program, we've worked with our industry organizations and directly with the Fed to be prepared to utilize these loan programs to help our larger commercial customers through the crisis. \u2047 And for our communities, we've increased the amount of our 2020 philanthropy budget and repositioned dollars to support those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We've made more than $375,000 in donations thus far to Feeding America, the American Red Cross and United Way's across our footprint to provide urgent basic needs. \u2047 I'll now turn to our financial highlights on Slide 3. \u2047 Webster's first quarter results continue to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to strong execution on strategic priorities through any and all operating environments. \u2047 Pre-provision net revenue of $125 million was up modestly from Q4, driven by a slight increase in total revenue and a slight decline in expenses. \u2047 Earnings per share were $0.39 in the quarter compared to $0.96 in Q4 of 2019 and $1.06 in the prior year's first quarter. \u2047 The declines resulted primarily from an increased provision resulting from the adoption of CECL, a weakening forward economic outlook and the impact of a significantly lower interest rate environment. \u2047 Glenn and I will walk you through the assumptions underlying our CECL process and ultimate provision number. \u2047 Our CECL process is strong, consistent with the requirements and controls of the accounting process. \u2047 In this quarter, that process included the appropriate amount of conservatism and thoughtful judgment to reflect the uncertainty of the environment and the behaviors in our portfolio with respect to onset of the pandemic. \u2047 Tangible book value per common share increased 8% from prior year. \u2047 Our first quarter return on common equity was 4.75%, and return on tangible common equity was 5.95%, with each reflecting the $68 million reserve build in the quarter. \u2047 The combination of a slight increase in total revenue and a slight decrease in expenses led to improvement in the efficiency ratio, which was 58% in Q1. \u2047 March 31st reported credit metrics remained strong, while our forward forecast of economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 Slide 4 presents loan and deposit trends. \u2047 Loan growth was strong as total loans grew 11%, and commercial loans grew almost 16% from a year ago or by more than $1.8 billion. \u2047 Strong organic growth in CRE was augmented by approximately $450 million in revolver drawdowns in the commercial portfolio in March and we saw a reduction in prepayment activity. \u2047 Deposits grew 7.7% year-over-year, driven by the inflow of HSA deposits and public funds, and transactional and HSA deposits now represent 60% of total deposits, up from 57% a year ago. \u2047 Also of note, footings at HSA Bank increased 9% from a year ago for growth of $679 million during the year. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5, I will spend a few minutes speaking to each of our three lines of business. \u2047 In Commercial Banking, loans were up nearly 7% linked quarter and 15.5% from a year ago, which includes the aforementioned $450 million in net revolver draws. \u2047 CRE drove the year-over-year growth, while Sponsor & Specialty loan balances, which saw the lion's share of the revolver draws drove the linked quarter increase. \u2047 Prepayments were lower in the quarter, partially attributable to lower economic and transaction activity in the second half of the quarter due to the emergence of the pandemic. \u2047 Deposits were up smartly some 15% linked quarter and 20% from a year ago, largely driven by the depositing of revolver draws into DDA. \u2047 Normalizing for revolver usage, deposits were up approximately 5% in Commercial Banking in the quarter. \u2047 Loan and deposit volumes in the quarter drove a 3% year-over-year increase in net interest income and Commercial Banking despite rate pressure. \u2047 Expenses were up 4.3% year-over-year, driven by investment in people and technology. \u2047 Commercial Banking PPNR was relatively flat year-over-year. \u2047 While we are appropriately cautious with new underwriting activities, I can tell you that we closed meaningful high-quality new business in the quarter in segments that are not experience -- experiencing a material adverse impact from the pandemic, segments such as software and technology infrastructure. \u2047 In fact, in early April, we closed our largest agency deal on a best efforts basis, a $350 million technology infrastructure deal where we held just over 10% of the risk after close. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6. \u2047 In HSA Bank, we are continuing to make great progress. \u2047 We concluded another successful first quarter as we opened 338,000 new accounts for a total of 734,000 new accounts opened over the last 12 months. \u2047 In addition, we added over 1,000 new employers in the quarter. \u2047 There was no material impact in the quarter related to the previously reported movement of accounts tied to the decision by two wholesale partners, custodial partners to in-source account administration. \u2047 Ending accounts were up 6.4% to $3.1 million, while deposits increased 8.5% to $6.7 billion. \u2047 The 2019 year-end Devenir report indicated an overall HSA market that slowed marginally as the market growth rate of accounts was flat and the deposit growth rate declined by three percentage points during the year. \u2047 One important point to note is that HSA Bank's funded account growth rate was 9.2% in 2019 compared to the industry rate of 5.6%. \u2047 In the first quarter, our funded account growth rate was 6.8% year-over-year, both reflective of our consistently low percentage of unfunded accounts when compared to industry data. \u2047 We had a good start to the year from a sales perspective as we signed several large employers in the quarter. \u2047 We also announced a major partnership with Jellyvision that will further enable our customers to make informed and smart healthcare choices. \u2047 We also launched partnerships with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Principal Financial Group. \u2047 These partnerships are all uniquely capable of delivering strong growth especially within the jumbo employer market. \u2047 In addition, as you may have seen, yesterday, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire State Farm Bank's portfolio of seasoned HSA accounts, representing approximately $140 million in deposits. \u2047 We expect to close that transaction in the second or third quarter. \u2047 In response to the pandemic and consistent with all of Webster, we were able to quickly transition 96% of our HSA staff to work from home in less than three weeks, maintaining 24/7 customer support and continuing to meet service and quality metrics. \u2047 In addition, we are working closely to support our customers through the pandemic at a time when our services may be particularly critical, including capabilities we have deployed directly or via partnerships, such as eHealth, HSA FSA Store, GoodRx, Blink Health, Medical Cost Advocate and Healthcare Bluebook. \u2047 We feel that the current legislative and political landscape remains favorable for the HSA industry and the chances of a near-term Medicare for all national healthcare solution are even more remote than they were a year ago. \u2047 Our relationship with WEX, our technology partner and Cigna, our largest HSA partner have never been stronger. \u2047 I'm on Page 7. \u2047 In Community Banking, we've done a tremendous job keeping our employees and customers safe, while continuing to provide the standard of customer service our clients expect. \u2047 Total community bank loans grew by 5% year-over-year with business banking loans leading the way at 9%. \u2047 Deposits grew by 3%, again led by business banking. \u2047 Non-interest income was up 9% as a result of higher mortgage and investment services revenue. \u2047 Many more customers have transitioned to self-service channels as digitally active households crossed 50% in the quarter for the first time and we see that trend continuing given the pandemic. \u2047 As you can imagine, our Community Banking team along with the resources from across the bank are working digitally -- diligently in executing on the PPP loan program, which will help so many of our customers. \u2047 We've been focusing on customer outreach and support. \u2047 And I can't say enough about the way our community bankers, including all of those in our banking centers have delivered for our customers and communities during the first quarter and over the last several weeks. \u2047 First, we are completely focused on internal execution, and other than opportunistic HSA transactions, bank M&A remains a low priority. \u2047 We have a strong capital position enabling us to support our customers and assist in the financial recovery in the country. \u2047 Also after a modest repurchase of approximately 2 million shares in early Q1 before the onset of the pandemic, we do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares until this pandemic is behind us. \u2047 I'll begin with our average balance sheet on Slide 8. \u2047 Average loans grew $516 million or 2.6% linked quarter. \u2047 Growth was led primarily by the commercial business. \u2047 A linked quarter increase of $329 million in commercial real estate was the result of strong originations and a reduction in pay-offs. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, our commercial real estate loans grew more than $1 billion. \u2047 Commercial loans now represent 66% of total loans compared to 63% in prior year. \u2047 Consumer loan performance was driven by a $96 million increase in residential mortgages with some offset in home equity. \u2047 On the deposit side, our low-cost transactional and HSA deposits have increased more than $1.2 billion from last year and now represent 60% of total deposits with a combined cost of 13 basis points. \u2047 The Q1 seasonal inflow of HSA and government deposits funded loan growth, as well as a $200 million reduction in short-term borrowings. \u2047 With regard to capital, the modest average linked quarter reduction in common equity is reflective of a day one CECL adjustment of $58 million and approximately $77 million as a result of share repurchases in the quarter. \u2047 Likewise, modest reductions in the common equity Tier 1 and tangible common equity ratios are also reflective of CECL, share repurchases and asset growth. \u2047 We have elected to phase in the CECL impact on regulatory capital, which favorably impacts our ratios by 20 basis points to 25 basis points. \u2047 Even excluding the phase-in in capital treatment, our capital ratios would remain very strong and well in excess of regulatory well-capitalized levels. \u2047 Slide 9 summarizes our Q1 income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings. \u2047 Net interest income was flat to prior quarter as the $6 million benefit from loan growth was offset by the effect of a lower rate environment. \u2047 This is reflective in our net interest margin, which was lower by four basis points versus Q4, 16 basis points due to lower loan yield, which was partially offset by nine basis points from lower deposit costs and three basis points from lower borrowing costs. \u2047 Versus prior"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $0.39.  \u2047  compname reports
