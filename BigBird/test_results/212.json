{"article": ["Hosting the call, today are Doron Blachar, our Chief Executive Officer; Assi Ginzburg, Chief Financial Officer; Smadar Lavi, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. \u2047 Actual future results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. \u2047 For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see Risk Factors section as described in Ormat Technologies annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that are filed with the SEC. \u2047 In addition, during the call, the company will present non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. \u2047 Doron, the call is yours. \u2047 This was a productive quarter for Ormat. \u2047 As we are progressing with our plans to grow our Electricity and Energy Storage segment, the quarter was highlighted by execution of our organic and M&A growth strategies. \u2047 We completed the expansion of the McGinness Complex in Nevada with higher generating capacity than originally planned, and made significant progress ramping up generation of the Puna plant in Hawaii. \u2047 Simultaneously, we closed a significant acquisition of two operating power plants and two other assets, which should contribute to our future growth. \u2047 In the Energy Storage segment, we continue with our BD efforts to secure new interconnection in land position to support our pipeline and we recently released two storage asset for construction. \u2047 The progress in our growth reinforces our belief that we can achieve our stated goals of increasing Ormat's combined geothermal energy storage and solar generating portfolio to more than 1.5-gigawatt by 2023. \u2047 While we continue to view 2021 is a buildup year in which we lay additional groundwork to accelerate our growth. \u2047 The increased backlog and sales pipeline, along with the -- I guess the only tailwinds and significant portfolio growth coming from our Electricity and Energy Storage segment support our target of an annual run rate of more than $500 million in adjusted EBITDA toward the end of 2022. \u2047 Let me start my review of the financial results on Slide 5. \u2047 Total revenue for the second quarter were $146.4 million, down 16% from the prior year. \u2047 The driver for the decrease were the product segment, which was impacted by low product backlog. \u2047 Second quarter 2021 consolidated gross profit was $52 million, resulting in a gross margin of 35.4%, 200 basis point lower than in the second quarter of 2020, mainly driven by the reduction in the Electricity segment. \u2047 This quarter, we experienced mostly temporary issues related to the Olkaria, Steamboat and Brawley complexes. \u2047 These issues reduced our Electricity gross profit by approximately $8 million. \u2047 For the six months, gross margin was 40.1%, similar to the same period last year. \u2047 We delivered net income attributed to the company stockholders of $13 million or $0.23 in the quarter compared to $23 million or $0.45 per share for the same quarter last year. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 22.6%, which is lower than the 33% effective tax rate from the second quarter of 2020, mainly due to the movement in the valuation allowances for each quarter. \u2047 We now expect the annual effective tax rate to stand by approximately 33% for the full-year 2021, assuming no material one-time impacts. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 13.6% to $84.5 million in the second quarter, impacted mainly by gross profit reduction and higher G&A expenses, driven by increased legal costs. \u2047 Moving to Slide 6; breaking the revenue down, Electricity segment revenues increased 4% to $134 million, supported by contribution from new added capacity at our Steamboat and McGinness Hill complexes, as well as Puna resumed operation. \u2047 In addition, our Steamboat Complex had a mechanical issue, it was resolved few days later. \u2047 And in Brawley, we experienced a surface leak in one of the injection wells, which reduced generation. \u2047 In the Product segment, revenue declined 83% to $7.4 million, representing 5% of total revenue in the second quarter. \u2047 The decline year-over-year is expected to continue throughout '21, due to the lower backlog and the beginning -- from the beginning of the year. \u2047 Energy storage segment revenues increased nearly 124% year-over-year to $5.6 million in the second quarter, representing 4% of our total revenue for the quarter. \u2047 The growth was mainly driven by revenues from the acquired Pomona energy storage asset and the contribution of our Vallecito facility in California, which started commercial operation in April of 2021. \u2047 Let's move to Slide 7. \u2047 Gross margin for the Electricity segment for the quarter decreased year-over-year to 37.4%. \u2047 This was the result of a higher cost related to the repair of the recovery of the Olkaria, Steamboat, and Brawley complexes. \u2047 In addition, in the second quarter last year, we did record a business interruption insurance recovery of $2.7 million related to Puna complex compared to zero this year. \u2047 In the Product segment, gross margin was 20.1% in the second quarter compared to 20.6% in the same time last year. \u2047 The Energy Storage segment reported again a positive gross margin compared to a negative gross margin in the second quarter last year. \u2047 The improvement was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Pomona Energy Storage assets. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA decreased 40% to $84.5 million in the second quarter, impacted mainly by gross profit reduction and higher G&A expenses, driven by increased legal costs. \u2047 The Electricity segment generated 94% of the total Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter and the Product segment generated 4%. \u2047 The Storage segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $2 million, which represent 2% of the total adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 Reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are provided in the appendix slide. \u2047 On Slide 9; our net debt as of June 30, 2021, was $1.40 billion. \u2047 Cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash and cash equivalent as of June 30 was approximately $330 million compared to $537 million as of year-end. \u2047 In addition, we had $46 million of marketable securities. \u2047 Slide 9 breaks down the use of case for the six months and illustrates our ability to reinvest in the business, service debt, and return capital to our shareholders in form of cash dividends. \u2047 All from cash generated by operation and our strong liquidity position. \u2047 Our long-term debt as of June 30, 2021, was $1.4 billion, net of deferred financing costs and its payment schedule is presented on Slide 30, in the appendix. \u2047 The average cost of debt was 4.9%. \u2047 During July, we closed two new corporate loan raising approximately $175 million out of which $50 million are green bonds provided HSBC bank. \u2047 Funds were used to finance the Terra-Gen acquisition. \u2047 On August 4, 2021, the company Board of Directors declared approved and authorized payment of quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share pursuant to the company's dividend policy. \u2047 The dividend will be paid on September 1, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business day on August 18, 2021. \u2047 In addition, we expect to pay dividend of $0.12 per share in the next quarter. \u2047 That concludes my financial overview. \u2047 Turning to Slide 12, for a look at our operating portfolio. \u2047 Power generation in our power plants increased by approximately 2.4% compared to last year. \u2047 In the second quarter, we see the continued contribution of Steamboat related started operation in mid-2020. \u2047 The incremental contribution of McGinness Hill for approximately one month and the generation from Puna that is operating still in passive capacity. \u2047 These were partially offset by continued curtailment in low performance of the field in Olkaria power plant and other operational issues in the US that I will elaborate shortly. \u2047 We recently completed the expansion of our McGinness Hill facility and are now providing electricity for approximately 6,000 homes, while offsetting approximately 63,000 tons of CO2 emissions, delivering the highest level of efficiency and safety in the geothermal industry. \u2047 With the addition of the acquired operating assets, we are running one-gigawatt electricity portfolio, an increase of 83-megawatt in the second quarter. \u2047 As noted on Slide 13, Puna resumed operation in November 2020. \u2047 We have ramped Puna generation to approximately 28-megawatts, following the repair of a turbine, up from 20-megawatts in our last quarterly report. \u2047 We expect to reach 30-megawatts by year-end. \u2047 We have continued discussions with HELCO and the PUC about our new PPA and continue selling electricity under our existing PPA, which is in effect until the end of 2027. \u2047 Turning to Slide 14. \u2047 Let me discuss some of the challenges we experienced this quarter in a few of our operating assets. \u2047 And I would start with the known one in Kenya. \u2047 Our revenue in Olkaria complex was down year-over-year, as a result of continued curtailment and a reduction in the performance of the resource. \u2047 The combination of which has resulted in approximately a reduction of generating capacity of 25-megawatts. \u2047 This reduction in capacity reduced our quarterly gross margin by approximately $2.7 million. \u2047 We are operating to restore the complex generating capacity through our continuous drilling campaign in Kenya, and are optimistic we will see an increase in production through and by the end of the year. \u2047 We expect a similar quarter reduction in revenue until capacity is fully restored. \u2047 We also experienced a mechanical failure at our Steamboat Complex, resulting in revenue loss and interest expenses that reduced gross margin by approximately $2 million. \u2047 The Steamboat complex is now back to full operation. \u2047 In the Brawley Complex, we had a leak in one of the injections well and a pump failure in one of the production well which caused the reduction of the generating capacity to three-megawatt. \u2047 We are working to restore full production in Brawley. \u2047 The second half of 2021 will be impacted by the low performance of the Olkaria and Brawley power plant. \u2047 And we have updated our annual guidance accordingly. \u2047 Turning to Slide 15. \u2047 In July, we closed the acquisition Terra-Gen asset. \u2047 This acquisition added a total net generating capacity of approximately 67.5-megawatts to our portfolio. \u2047 In addition, we bought the greenfield development asset adjacent to Dixie Valley with high resource potential. \u2047 And an underutilized transmission line capable of handling between 300-megawatts to 400-megawatts on 230-kilowatt electricity, connecting Dixie Valley to California. \u2047 With this acquisition, we now own 10 operating plants in Nevada, generating a total of 443-megawatt. \u2047 The proximity of this plant to population centers in both Nevada and California is important. \u2047 California remains at the forefront of driving the adoption of renewable energy with supportive mandates and requirements already in place and more being considered. \u2047 Utility companies in California are increasingly looking for affordable and reliable renewable energy. \u2047 This dynamic made the acquired transmission lines increasingly important. \u2047 Turning to Slide 16 for an update on our backlog. \u2047 While the results of our product segment continue to be impacted by the lower backlog at the beginning of the year, we are starting to see encouraging signs of recovery. \u2047 We have seen clear signs of improvement in this business, including an expansion of our backlog, reinforcing our confidence that this is a short-term phenomenon. \u2047 As of August 4, 2021, our product segment backlog increased 59% by $22 million to reach $59 million compared to $37 million in early May this year. \u2047 We signed a few contracts during the quarter, including a new contract with Star Energy Geothermal to supply products to a new 14- megawatt Salak geothermal power plant in Indonesia and then other contract to supply equipment to the project in Japan. \u2047 Despite the recent improvements in this segment, we anticipate continued weakness in our product revenue during 2021 and have adjusted our annual guidance accordingly. \u2047 Partially offsetting the weakness of the product segment, there has been a consistent improvement in our Energy Storage segment. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier and as discussed in Slide 17, this business continues to become a more important part of our consolidated results. \u2047 This quarter our projects in both the East Coast and Texas enjoyed higher revenues due to higher market prices. \u2047 The Storage Segment again generated positive EBITDA and we released two new project for construction in Ohio and California. \u2047 Moving to Slide 18. \u2047 As previously mentioned, the supported mandates being implemented in California and the increasing demand for affordable and reliable renewable energy in this state. \u2047 One example is the recent ruling by CTC[Phonetic] require electrical load service entities LLCs to procure 11.5-gigawatt of new clean electricity by 2026. \u2047 One gigawatt of this procurement must deliver thermal power with an 80% capacity factor produce zero onsite emission and be weather- independent. \u2047 No form of renewable energy generation is more poised to fill this slate than geothermal, with a 95% capacity factor and thermal flexible generation. \u2047 Geothermal energy is not only an excellent complement to intermittent resources, but the natural replacement for baseload fossil fuels and nuclear generation. \u2047 California efforts to achieve its goal of 100% carbon free electricity by 2045, through massive deployment of renewable energy and energy storage resources enable us to sign new contracts for geothermal and we did this quarter with CPA for 14-megawatt Heber South geothermal power plant in the Imperial Valley, California. \u2047 We also issued our first ever request for the -- for the 26-megawatt Heber 2 and actively look for opportunities for our storage platform. \u2047 Moving to Slide 20 and 21. \u2047 As we have communicated, 2021 will be a significant buildup year, comprised mainly of geothermal project. \u2047 This build up support of robust growth plans, which is expected to increase our total portfolio by almost 50% by the end of 2023. \u2047 Our medium-term goal in the electricity segment is to add an additional 240-megawatts to 250-megawatts by year-end 2023, above the 80-megawatts added since the beginning of 2021. \u2047 And in our rapidly growing energy storage portfolio, we plan to enhance our growth and to increase our portfolio by 200-megawatts to 300-megawatts by year-end 2022. \u2047 Achieving this growth target is expected to help us reach an annual run rate of more than $500 million in adjusted EBITDA toward the end of 2022 that we expect to continue"], "gold_summary": ["q2 earnings per share $0.23.  \u2047  increases 2021 revenue annual guidance.  \u2047  sees 2021 total revenues of between $650 million
