{"article": ["These are important to review and contemplate as everyone on the call today is well aware, business environment uncertainty remains tightened due to COVID-19. \u2047 These items include shutdown impacts from many areas of the economy, ongoing changes to consumer purchasing habits, the potential for disruptive supply chain, heightened unemployment and many other economic factors. \u2047 This means that results could change at any time and the forecasted impact of risk considerations is the best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. \u2047 Additional information concerning risk factors and cautionary statements are available in our most recent SEC filings and most recent company 10-K. \u2047 I'll now hand it over to our CEO, Ron Lombardi. \u2047 Let's start on slide five. \u2047 I'm pleased to report our long-term strategy and business positioning continued to deliver solid results as seen in Q2, where we experienced strong earnings growth and a stable revenue performance. \u2047 We continue to focus on the critical near-term factors that I've previously discussed in order to successfully navigate the pandemic environment. \u2047 For starters, our long-term strategy of providing consumers with a wide range of brands they know and trust continues to work. \u2047 In this unique time, we continue to see consumers turn to our leading brands to meet their healthcare needs. \u2047 Meanwhile, our business continuity efforts have been paying off. \u2047 We continue to work closely with our manufacturing partners to ensure consistent service levels in this tight supply environment. \u2047 In Q2, we continue to find effective ways to optimize our brands during the pandemic as consumer habits have begun to stabilize. \u2047 We are benefiting from these agile investments in channels such as e-commerce, and our portfolio remains well positioned for the long time. \u2047 Finally, our strong operating model and disciplined capital strategy continue to reward stakeholders. \u2047 We continue to use our industry-leading financial profile to further reduce debt in the quarter. \u2047 We have reduced leverage levels to the lowest point since 2014, which continues to increase our capital allocation optionality. \u2047 So to recap, we continue to feel good about our positioning and the agile adjustments made during COVID-19. \u2047 Q2 performance reinforces the strength of our business, and we look forward to further benefits. \u2047 I'll now hand it over to Chris to review Q2 financial results. \u2047 Q2 revenue of $237.4 million declined 50 basis points on an organic basis versus the prior year, which excludes the effects of foreign currency. \u2047 By segment, North America revenues were up 1.3%, positively impacted by the women's health analgesics, Oral Care and ear and eye care categories, partially offset by lower cough and cold and GI shipments at certain categories we participate in face declines in incidence levels and usage rates related to COVID-19. \u2047 Our international business declined approximately 16% after excluding foreign currency. \u2047 This decline was primarily attributable to significantly lower sales of Hydralyte in Australia as a result of COVID-19's impact to lowering both general consumer illness and activities such as athletic. \u2047 We anticipate headwinds for the brand and the region to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share for the second quarter grew approximately 5% and 15%, respectively, versus the prior year. \u2047 Solid earnings per share growth was attributable to lower G&A costs and lower interest expense from debt paydown. \u2047 Let's turn slide eight for more detail around consolidated results and first half performance. \u2047 For the first half, our revenues were down 60 basis points, excluding foreign currency. \u2047 Revenue growth continued to benefit from strong consumption trends in the e-commerce channel as consumers continue to shift to online purchasing. \u2047 We broadly benefited from strength in many brands in our portfolio, but did experience consumption declines in certain categories as a result of COVID-19, most notably the cough, cold and motion sickness categories. \u2047 Total company gross margin of 58% was flat to last year's adjusted gross margin and stable to recent quarters. \u2047 This was in line with our expectations for Q2 and also what we anticipate for the remainder of fiscal '21. \u2047 Advertising and marketing came in at 16.1% of revenue in Q2 and 14.2% for the first six months. \u2047 As anticipated, A&M returned to normalized levels in the second quarter. \u2047 We expect A&M for the full year to be just under 15% as a percent of sales as we continue at a normalized rate of spend in the second half. \u2047 G&A expenses declined both for Q2 and the first six months of fiscal '21 versus the prior year, owed largely to disciplined cost management. \u2047 For the full year, we anticipate G&A expenses to approximate 9% and remain below prior year in absolute dollars. \u2047 EPS for the first six months of fiscal '21 grew approximately 23% versus the prior year. \u2047 Lower operating costs, lower interest expense and lower share count were all contributors to the strong growth. \u2047 Finally, I'd like to provide a few additional comments on below the line items for your modeling purposes. \u2047 Moving forward, we anticipate our ongoing tax rate to approximate 24%, reflecting the recent finalization of tax code changes. \u2047 For the full year fiscal '21, we expect interest expense to approximate $83 million. \u2047 In the second quarter, we generated $43.1 million in free cash flow, which was lower than last year due to planned capex investments. \u2047 First half fiscal '21 total free cash flow of $115.7 million grew 18% versus the prior year. \u2047 In the second quarter, we continued to focus on debt reduction and paid down $74 million in debt. \u2047 At September quarter end, we had approximately $1.5 billion in net debt, which equated to a leverage ratio of 4.3 times. \u2047 We expect to continue to prioritize debt pay down as our primary use of free cash flow, followed by other opportunistic capital allocation decisions. \u2047 Despite the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, a few key factors underpin our strong financial results in the first half and have us well positioned for the balance of the year. \u2047 We continue to remain focused on safety and business continuity. \u2047 Our team members have adapted impressively to this vulnerable environment faced today. \u2047 This extends to our third-party suppliers who we continue to work closely with in a dynamic supply chain environment. \u2047 Ultimately, the objective of these efforts is to maintain a laser focus on service levels to our retail partners. \u2047 Although a continuing effort, I'm pleased to report that we've maintained a strong supply chain that's enabled to remain well stopped at retail. \u2047 Our broad and diverse portfolio is an invaluable core strength of our business. \u2047 Not only are we diversified, as shown on the left side of the page, but the vast majority of our key brands have a deep heritage in connection with consumers. \u2047 The majority of our key brands are number one in their category, which allows us to focus on meeting evolving consumer needs. \u2047 These factors provide us a great starting advantage as we navigate the impact of COVID-19. \u2047 We are leveraging these attributes and investing in our key brands for long-term success. \u2047 The strategy is working and is evident in our stable results for the first six months, where these factors helped to offset declines in certain categories like travel, sports activities and cost. \u2047 This diversification and leading positions have also found great tailwinds from various consumer trends during COVID-19. \u2047 For example, consumers have increased the use of health and hygiene-related products, while at the same time, being more cautious around time spent in public. \u2047 The result of this is an accelerated shift to e-commerce shopping, along with consumers increasing purchases of self care products. \u2047 Even further, consumers are seeking brands they know and trust during this recession. \u2047 We are well positioned to from these shifts. \u2047 First, we have the benefit of having many leading brands that help consumers treat health incidences at home. \u2047 We've reallocated marketing dollars to opportunities to help with self-care, like Monistat, Compound W and DenTek. \u2047 Our toolkit is wide ranging. \u2047 In this example, the end goal is to remind consumers how our leading brands help them avoid a doctor's visit. \u2047 Second, we benefited in a big way from consumers shifting additional purchases into e-commerce. \u2047 Our early investments in this channel over the last several years continues to pay off. \u2047 Finally, with 10 of our top dozen brands holding number one market shares, we have the fortunate position of being the trusted go-to brand for consumers in many categories. \u2047 We continue to benefit from these strengths, resulting in a stable business performance during the pandemic thus far. \u2047 Our multiyear investments around e-commerce are delivering impressive results. \u2047 These investments have led us to achieve market shares above our brick-and-mortar share in many categories. \u2047 In the second quarter and first six months, we were able to successfully engage with consumers as their spending patterns continue to shift online. \u2047 We experienced solid results that are direct results of our efforts and positioning with Q2 consumption e-commerce growing triple digits once again. \u2047 We've also experienced success in omnichannel consumer shopping. \u2047 As a leader in consumer healthcare e-commerce, we are pleased to continue to benefit from the growing interest in this channel by consumers. \u2047 We are continuing to make investments behind online content broadly with the goal of expanding our share of consumers. \u2047 The examples on the right side of the page are useful reminders that our investments are wide ranging. \u2047 Our Monistat.com web page was recently refreshed. \u2047 And since the refresh, the Monistat site has seen, on average, 300,000 visitors a month, including helping about 90,000 women a month self-diagnose infection with the brand's symptom checker. \u2047 This online tool is one of many examples where we go beyond supplying a product being a consumer's trusted connection as they research their healthcare needs. \u2047 We have also enhanced the marketing and communications around our brands that consumers are using at home. \u2047 Compound W is one example of this. \u2047 We are focused on expanding our leading position by using simple to understand marketing that reminds consumers of the ability to treat works effectively at home. \u2047 These strategies have resonated with consumers, enabling and expanding our strong number one market share position. \u2047 To recap, by remaining active and investing around e-commerce, our brands are set up for success. \u2047 As the pandemic continues to shift consumer preferences, this provides a great positioning for our brands to benefit. \u2047 We have achieved portfolio stability by rapidly transitioning our marketing efforts to adapt to the current environment. \u2047 We continue to adjust our brand-building strategy in real-time, focusing investments around current brand opportunities. \u2047 Our largest brand, Summer's Eve, is engaged in a multi-pronged marketing effort designed to grow household penetration with women over time. \u2047 With consumers staying at home, we refocused marketing efforts around home workouts for the recently launched Summer's Eve active product. \u2047 Omnichannel efforts have driven consumer awareness and positive feedback and Summer's Eve active is often listed as a best choice by Amazon when consumers research feminine wash. \u2047 This is just one of many efforts that is driving Summers Eve solid sales growth year-to-date. \u2047 On the right of the page, is Clear Eyes. \u2047 Brand messaging has evolved during the pandemic to emphasize the brand promise of having brighter, lighter and more comfortable eyes. \u2047 We focused on the concept of at home usage and are using time-tested brand building tactics. \u2047 Most recently, we have a new spokesperson, Supermodel Hilary Rhoda. \u2047 As a Clear Eyes user, she demonstrates the ability Clear Eyes has of giving a consumer great redness relief at a great price. \u2047 More than halfway through the year, our business positioning and execution of the strategy behind it have resulted in a stable top line performance that is driving meaningful cash flow and earnings growth. \u2047 The portfolio diversity and our business strategy highlighted today, position us to continue to maintain and grow market share across our key brands in coming quarters. \u2047 Given our recent stability, we are offering full year guidance based on the trends we are seeing today. \u2047 For the full fiscal year '21, we anticipate revenue of approximately $925 million. \u2047 This outlook reflects our assumption that the business trends and stability experienced in Q2 continues into the second half, along with a headwind in the second half during the peak season for cough and cold products. \u2047 Most importantly, we remain committed to our long-term brand building and investment strategy to position our portfolio for long-term sales growth. \u2047 We also anticipate adjusted earnings per share of approximately $3.18 in fiscal '21. \u2047 Our cost management efforts, along with the benefit of our capital allocation strategy and debt reduction, enabling full year earnings growth of high single digits. \u2047 Last, our strong and stable free cash flow remains a company's strength. \u2047 Free cash flow is expected to be at or above last year's level of $207 million. \u2047 As always, we intend to execute a disciplined capital allocation strategy with a near-term focus on debt reduction to drive shareholder value. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q2
