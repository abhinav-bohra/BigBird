{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Kent Masters, our chief executive officer; and Scott Tozier, our chief financial officer; Raphael Crawford, president of Catalyst; Netha Johnson, president of Bromine Specialties; and Eric Norris, president of Lithium, are also available for Q&A. \u2047 Please also note that some of our comments today refer to non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Scott will provide more detail on our results, outlook, and guidance. \u2047 We reported another solid quarter with net sales of $831 million and adjusted EBITDA of $218 million. \u2047 Sales improved by 11% on a year-over-year basis, while adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat compared to the third quarter last year. \u2047 Excluding FCS from our third quarter 2020 results, our net sales were 19% higher and EBITDA was up 14%. \u2047 Scott will get into more detail on our financials in a few minutes including favorable revisions to our guidance. \u2047 During our recent Investor Day, we did a deep dive into our accelerated growth strategy and provided color on how we think about the near-term expansion of our Lithium business as well as our disciplined investment approach. \u2047 Since that event in early September, we are pleased to have announced several updates on those efforts. \u2047 This includes signing an agreement to acquire Guangxi Tianyuan New Energy Materials, or Tianyuan, which owns a recently built conversion plant near Qinzhou. \u2047 We are totaling to ensure the plant operates as advertised and expect to close this transaction in the first quarter of next year. \u2047 This puts us on track for first sales from this plant in the first half of next year. \u2047 In addition to this plant, we have signed two recent agreements for investments in China to support two greenfield projects, each initially targeting 50,000 metric tons per year. \u2047 These projects position us for initial added conversion capacity of up to 150,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide on an annual basis to meet our customers' growing demands. \u2047 In addition, our MARBL joint venture announced the restart of the Wodgina Lithium Mine in Western Australia. \u2047 On Slide 5, you will see the objectives we set for 2021. \u2047 When we set these goals, we did so with the intent of challenging ourselves with plans that were aggressive, but achievable. \u2047 As we approach the end of the year, I'm excited by the significant progress and proud of the effort our team has put into achieving these goals. \u2047 As you see on this slide, we have accomplished the vast majority of what we set out to do. \u2047 For example, we are successfully progressing high-return, fast payback Bromine projects at both Magnolia and JBC. \u2047 These projects will increase our capacity and improve the efficiencies of our operations. \u2047 We've also made significant progress on our lithium growth projects. \u2047 First, at La Negra III and IV, our team continues to execute to plan. \u2047 I'm excited to announce that we recently completed a major milestone by achieving first lithium carbonate production in late October. \u2047 Initial production volumes will be used to qualify the plant and the material with our customers to ensure we are meeting their requirements. \u2047 This qualification process is proceeding on track with first sales expected in the first half of next year. \u2047 In Western Australia, the ongoing labor shortages and pandemic-related travel restrictions have continued to significantly impact virtually all companies in that region and show no signs of easing in the near term. \u2047 Despite these efforts and with Herculean efforts, our team has managed to hold Kemerton I construction completion to year-end 2021. \u2047 We now expect Kemerton II construction completion in the second half of 2022. \u2047 While we are facing challenges at these projects, our strategy to consolidate resources and prioritize the first train continues to mitigate additional risks. \u2047 On Slide 7, I'll highlight the progress we've made on our Wave III program since we last spoke to you at our Investor Day. \u2047 At the end of September, we announced an agreement to acquire Tianyuan for $200 million, including a recently built conversion plant near the port of Qinzhou designed to produce up to 25,000 metric tons of lithium per year with the potential to expand to 50,000 metric tons per year. \u2047 We expect this acquisition to follow a similar path as our acquisitions of Xinyu and Chengdu facilities back in 2016. \u2047 Following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the first quarter of next year, we plan to make additional investments to bring Qinzhou plant to Albemarle standards and ramp to initial production of 25,000 metric tons. \u2047 This acquisition enables us to accelerate conversion capacity growth and leverage our world-class resource base. \u2047 Together with our partner, we agreed to restart operations at the Wodgina Lithium Mine in Western Australia. \u2047 Initially, Wodgina will begin one of three processing lines, each of which can produce up to 250,000 metric tons of lithium spodumene concentrate. \u2047 This resource will be critical as we ramp our conversion capacity in Western Australia with our Kemerton sites. \u2047 We also signed agreements to invest in two greenfield conversion sites in China at Zhangjiagang and Meishan. \u2047 We plan to build identical conversion plants with initial target production of 50,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium hydroxide at each site. \u2047 These investments offer additional optionality for future growth and have expansion potential. \u2047 Investing in China offers capital-efficient, high-return growth with proximity to our low-cost Australian spodumene resources and many of our major cathode and battery customers. \u2047 We continue to explore global expansion of our conversion capacity as the battery supply chain shifts west. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8 for a review of our global project pipeline. \u2047 As you can see, Albemarle is executing a robust pipeline of projects all around the world. \u2047 For example, our bromine business is pursuing incremental expansions in Jordan and the United States. \u2047 These high-return projects leverage our low-cost resources and technical know-how to support customers in growing and diverse markets, like electronics, telecom and automotive. \u2047 In Chile, the Salar Yield Improvement Project allows us to increase lithium production without increasing our brine pumping rates utilizing a proprietary technology to improve efficiency and sustainability. \u2047 In Australia, we continue to progress study work on additional Kemerton expansions to leverage greater scale and efficiency with repeatable designs. \u2047 Finally, in the United States, we are expanding our Silver Peak facility in Nevada to double lithium carbonate production. \u2047 This is the first of several options to expand local U.S. production. \u2047 In Kings Mountain, North Carolina, we continue to evaluate restarting our mine. \u2047 And at our bromine facility in Magnolia, Arkansas, we're evaluating the process technologies to leverage our brines to extract lithium. \u2047 We'll continue to update you periodically on our pipeline. \u2047 I hope this gives you a sense of the diversity and optionality Albemarle has as a global lithium producer. \u2047 Let's begin on Slide 9. \u2047 During the third quarter, we generated net sales of $831 million, an 11% increase from the same period last year. \u2047 This improvement was driven by strong sales for our lithium and bromine segments. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, resulting from the sale of FCS and increased freight and raw material costs. \u2047 The GAAP net loss of $393 million includes a $505 million after-tax charge related to the recently announced Huntsman arbitration decision. \u2047 While we continue to assess our legal options, we have also initiated discussions with Huntsman regarding a potential resolution. \u2047 Excluding this charge, adjusted earnings per share was $1.05 for the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $218 million increased by 14% or $27 million compared to the prior year, excluding the sale of FCS. \u2047 Higher adjusted EBITDA for lithium and bromine was partially offset by a $13.5 million out-of-period adjustment regarding inventory valuation in our international locations, impacting all three GBUs. \u2047 Lithium's adjusted EBITDA increased by $25 million year over year, excluding foreign exchange. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for bromine increased by $5 million compared to the prior year due to higher pricing partially offset by increased freight and raw material costs. \u2047 Volumes were flat given the chlorine constraints in the quarter. \u2047 And Catalyst adjusted EBITDA declined $4 million from the previous year. \u2047 This was due to lower sales and cost pressures, partially offset by higher-than-expected joint venture income, which included a favorable tax settlement in Brazil. \u2047 Slide 11 highlights the company's financial strength that is key to our ability to execute our growth plans over the coming years. \u2047 Our net debt to EBITDA at the end of the quarter was 1.7 times and is below our targeted long-term range of two to 2.5 times. \u2047 This provides us with capacity to fund growth while supporting modest dividend increases. \u2047 We don't expect the recent arbitration decision to impact our current growth plans, but it could temporarily reduce our flexibility to take advantage of upside growth opportunities. \u2047 Turning to Slide 12, I'll walk you through the updates to our guidance that Kent mentioned earlier. \u2047 Higher full year 2021 net sales and adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects our strong third quarter performance. \u2047 Net cash from operations guidance is unchanged due to the timing of shipments to customers and increased raw materials and inventory costs. \u2047 Capital expenditures were revised higher related to the continuing tight labor markets and COVID-related travel restrictions in Western Australia, as well as accelerated investments in growth. \u2047 Turning to Slide 13 for a more detailed outlook on each of our GBUs. \u2047 Lithium's full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA is now expected to grow in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. \u2047 That's up from our previous guidance due to higher volumes and pricing. \u2047 The volume growth is driven primarily by tolling. \u2047 And our full year average realized pricing is now expected to be flat to slightly higher compared to 2020. \u2047 As a reminder, most of our battery-grade lithium sales are on long-term contracts with structured pricing mechanisms that are partially exposed to the market. \u2047 We also benefit from stronger market pricing on shorter-term technical grade sales and on spot and tolling sales of battery-grade lithium. \u2047 Full year 2021 average margins are expected to remain below 35% due to higher costs related to the project start-ups and tolling partially offset by productivity improvements. \u2047 Bromine's full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA growth is now expected to be in the low double digits. \u2047 That's also up from previous guidance due to the continued strength in demand and pricing for flame retardants. \u2047 Our bromine volumes remain constrained due to sold-out conditions and a lack of inventory. \u2047 The outlook for chlorine availability has improved since last quarter, but the market remains tight and the impact of higher chlorine pricing is expected to be felt more in 2022 than in 2021 due to the timing of inventory changes and shipments. \u2047 Year-to-date, higher bromine pricing has mostly offset higher raw material and freight costs. \u2047 Catalyst full year 2021 EBITDA is now expected to decline between 20% and 25%. \u2047 That's also an improvement from our previous guidance, owing to the higher-than-expected joint venture income. \u2047 The year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA is primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm earlier in the year, product mix and the previously disclosed change in our customers' order patterns. \u2047 Catalyst fourth quarter margins will also be impacted by product mix, including a greater proportion of lower-margin FCC and CFT resid orders. \u2047 FCC demand continues to improve with increasing global fuel demand, while HPC orders continue to be delayed. \u2047 Overall, market conditions are improving but volumes and Catalysts are not expected to return to prepandemic levels until late 2022 or 2023. \u2047 In total, we expect EBITDA margins to be lower in the fourth quarter due to higher raw materials, energy and freight costs across all 3 of our businesses. \u2047 We are closely watching several key risk factors, including global supply chain disruptions, global impacts of the energy rationing in China and chip shortages. \u2047 Supply chain and logistics challenges are the most immediate. \u2047 Our teams are working day and night to navigate these port issues, the lack of drivers and upstream supply disruptions to ensure our customers get their orders on time. \u2047 We also continue to monitor the global situation with regard to chip shortages. \u2047 We recognize that the auto industry has been struggling with those shortages. \u2047 But to date, we have not seen a direct impact on either our lithium or bromine orders. \u2047 And with that, I'll hand it back to Kent. \u2047 As Scott mentioned, we are disappointed by the outcome of the Huntsman arbitration decision. \u2047 But regardless of the ultimate outcome of that dispute, Albemarle will continue to focus on the execution of our growth strategy. \u2047 As we highlighted during our Investor Day in September, we have a well-thought out and focused operating model that we are implementing across our businesses. \u2047 This model, the Albemarle Way of Excellence, provides us with a framework to execute our objectives effectively and efficiently and will help us to remain on target as we pursue significant growth opportunities ahead. \u2047 And as we pursue these opportunities, we will be disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. \u2047 Our primary capital priority is accelerating high-return growth. \u2047 This means that we will invest not just to get bigger but to create tangible shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. \u2047 Utilizing this approach with our low-cost resources, we believe our annual adjusted EBITDA will triple by 2026. \u2047 Finally, at the core of all of this is sustainability. \u2047 As one of the world's largest lithium producers and innovators, we were able to work closely with our customers to create value and drive better sustainability outcomes for all stakeholders. \u2047 I'll hand over to the operator.
