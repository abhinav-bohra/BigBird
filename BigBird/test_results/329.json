{"article": ["Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated will begin with an overview of our operations in Japan and the US. \u2047 Fred Crawford, President and CEO of Aflac Incorporated will then touch briefly on conditions in the fourth quarter and discuss key initiatives including how we are navigating the pandemic. \u2047 Members of our US executive management team joining us for the Q&A segment of the call are Teresa White, President of Aflac US; Virgil Miller, President of Individual Benefits; Rich Williams, President of Group Benefits; Eric Kirsch, Global Chief Investment Officer and President of Aflac global investments; Al Riggieri, Global Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary; June Howard, Chief Accounting Officer; and Steve Beaver, CFO of Aflac US. \u2047 We are also joined by members of our executive management team in Tokyo at Aflac Life Insurance Japan. \u2047 Charles Lake, Chairman and Representative Director, President of Aflac International; Masatoshi Koide, President and Representative Director; Todd Daniels, Director and CFO; and Koji Ariyoshi, Director and Head of Sales and Marketing. \u2047 Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. \u2047 Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. \u2047 We encourage you to look at our annual report on Form 10-K for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. \u2047 aflac.com and includes reconciliations of certain non-US GAAP measures. \u2047 I'll now hand the call over to Dan. \u2047 At this time last year, it would have been very difficult to foresee the gravity of what was soon to unfold for society and for the company do to COVID-19. \u2047 I'm proud of our employees, our sales distribution and Board of Directors for their decisive people-first initiatives we spearheaded early on in both the United States and Japan to protect our workforce and to be here for our policyholders throughout this trying time. \u2047 We were able to reinforce our financial strength and operations, as well as our distribution franchise with digital and virtual investments to the position of our company for the future growth. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding the impact of foreign exchange increased 10.8% in 2020. \u2047 While benefiting from a lower effective tax rate, we were pleased with the results when you consider the pandemic pressure on revenues, accelerated investment in our core technological platforms and the initiatives to drive future earned premium growth and efficiency. \u2047 Investing in growth and innovation will continue to be critical strategic focus this year. \u2047 There is one central message it had been emphasizing with our management team. \u2047 It is imperative that we control the factors we have the ability to control and what we don't have control over, we must monitor continually to be ready to adapt. \u2047 Despite the fact that sales in both US and Japan had been suppressed considerably due the constraints of face-to-face opportunities, we did not sit still. \u2047 We maintained forward motion as we absorbed accelerated investment in our platform while continuing strong earning performance. \u2047 In 2020, Aflac Japan generated solid overall financial results with a stable profit margin of 21.2%, an extremely strong premium persistency of 95.1%. \u2047 The relaunch of our new cancer rider drove a sequential improvement in both cancer insurance and total sales in the fourth quarter. \u2047 As a result, total sales were down 22.2% for the quarter and 36.2% for the year. \u2047 In Japan, we introduced our new medical product in January and even up against difficult comparisons of last January that were pre-COVID sales, it is a positive launch exceeding our expectations. \u2047 We are encouraged by the reception of both the consumers and our sales force. \u2047 While these sales results represent sequential improvements relative to last quarter, the effective reduced face-to-face activity are evident and we continue to promote virtual sales. \u2047 Our goal in Japan is to be the leading company for living in your own way. \u2047 This is a declaration of how we tailor our products to fit the needs of customers during the different stages of their lives and reach them where are they want to buy through agencies, strategic alliance and banks. \u2047 Now turning to Aflac US, we saw a stable profit margin of 19.3% amid a year of intense investments in the future of our business and the global pandemic conditions. \u2047 However, this backdrop continues to notably impact our sales results in this segment as well, largely due to reduced face-to-face activity. \u2047 As expected, we saw modest sequential sales improvement in the quarter with a decrease of 27.2% for the quarter and 30.3 for the year. \u2047 In the US, we continue to feel the impact of limited access at the work site especially among our career agents who have historically relied upon face-to-face meetings to engage small business owners and their employees. \u2047 However, we remain cautiously optimistic for continued modest sequential sales improvement contingent upon the pace of the economic recovery and as a results, expect to see a wider second half of 2021. \u2047 Fred is responsible for acquisitions and he will cover that shortly. \u2047 But while these acquisitions may not have an immediate effect on the top line, they better position Aflac for future long-term sales in the United States. \u2047 As part of the Vision 2025 in the US, we seek to further develop a world where people are better prepared for unexpected health expenses, the need for the products we offer is a strong or stronger than ever has been and at the same time we know consumer habits and buying preferences have been evolving and we are looking to reach them in ways other than the traditional media and outside the work site. \u2047 This is part of the strategy to increase access, penetration and retention. \u2047 Even while working remotely for the greater part of the year, we remain true to our culture and identity as a socially responsible company. \u2047 We stepped up our engagement with our employees through virtual town meetings and weekly touch base letters. \u2047 Additionally, diversity continues to play an important role at Aflac as it has for decades. \u2047 I have always believed that in order to accomplish our goals and serve the community where we have a presence, we must surround our sales with a group of people who bring different perspectives to the table. \u2047 We have done that for years, at the end of 2020, nearly 50% of Aflac's US employees were minorities, 66% were women, 23% of our US senior officers were minorities and 30% were women. \u2047 And then when you think of Aflac's Board of Directors, 36% were minorities and 36% were women. \u2047 Diversity has always played an important role within ESG and[Indecipherable] with executive oversight of our ESG efforts. \u2047 He will provide greater detail on our 2021 key objectives. \u2047 I've always said that the true test of strength is how one handles adversity. \u2047 While pandemic conditions are ongoing, I'm pleased that 2020 confirmed what we knew all along and that is that Aflac is strong, adaptable and resilient. \u2047 We strive to be where people want to purchase insurance that applies to both Japan and the United States. \u2047 In the past, this is met meeting face to face with individuals to understand their situation propose a solution and close the sale. \u2047 However, the pandemic clearly demonstrates the need for virtual means. \u2047 In other words, non-face-to-face sales to reach potential customers and provide them with the prediction that they need. \u2047 Therefore we have accelerated investments to enhance the tools available for our distribution in both countries. \u2047 Related to capital deployment, we placed significant importance on continuing to achieve strong capital ratios in the United States in Japan on behalf of our policyholders and shareholders. \u2047 When it comes to capital deployment, we pursue value creation through a balance of actions including growth investments, stable dividend growth and disciplined tactical stock repurchase. \u2047 It goes without saying that we treasure our record of dividend growth. \u2047 The fourth quarter's declaration mark the 38th consecutive year of dividend increases. \u2047 Additionally, the Board approved a first quarter dividend increase of 17.9%. \u2047 Our dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. \u2047 At the same time, we remain tactical in our approach to share repurchase, buying back $1.5 billion of our shares in 2020. \u2047 We have also focused on integrating the growth investments we have made in our platform. \u2047 As always, we are working to achieve our earnings per share objectives while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. \u2047 By doing so, we look to emerge from this period in a continued position of strength and leadership. \u2047 I don't think it's coincidental that we've achieved our success while focusing on doing the right things, pull our policyholders, shareholders, employees, distribution channel, business partners and communities. \u2047 In fact, I believe that go hand in hand. \u2047 I'm proud of what we have accomplished in terms of both our social purpose and financial results, which have ultimately translated into strong long-term shareholder return. \u2047 Now let me turn the program over to Fred. \u2047 I'm going to touch briefly on conditions in the fourth quarter with respect to the pandemic. \u2047 I'll then provide an update on key initiatives in Japan and the US, Japan has experienced approximately 400,000 COVID-19 cases and 6,000 confirmed since inception of the virus. \u2047 While quite low as compared to other developed countries and the US, these statistics have more than doubled since the end of the third quarter. \u2047 Earlier this week, the government of Japan extended their state of emergency for Tokyo and 9 other prefectures through March 7. \u2047 This action includes the suspension of domestic tourism campaign and entry of foreigners into Japan. \u2047 We have responded with again moving more of our workforce to working from home, unlike the state of emergency declared last year in the initial stages of the virus. \u2047 Government restrictions are more balanced with economic recovery considerations and we have not prohibited face-to-face consultations and/or closed our sales shops. \u2047 Meanwhile, Prime Minister, Suga has announced a goal of beginning vaccinations mid-February. \u2047 Through the fourth quarter, Aflac Japan's COVID-19 impact totaled approximately 3400 unique claimants with incurred claims totaling JPY1 billion. \u2047 We continue to experience a significant reduction in paid claims for medical conditions other than COVID-19 as Japan manages hospital capacity and discourages more routine visits. \u2047 Despite the recent rise in infection rates in Japan, we continued to track well below our stress assumptions. \u2047 As Dan outlined, sales have clearly been impacted, but when looking at policies in force, the impact of reduced sales on earned premium has largely been offset by improved persistency with the reduction in reported revenue driven primarily by paid up policies. \u2047 Finally, pandemic related expenses in the quarter totaled JPY1.8 billion which includes the rollout of virtual distribution tools, employee teller working equipment and distribution support. \u2047 Turning to the US, there are nearly 27 million COVID-19 cases and 450,000 deaths as reported by the CDC. \u2047 For Aflac US in 2020, COVID-19 claimants totaled 23,000 with incurred claims of approximately 71 million in the quarter and $128 million for all of 2020. \u2047 We are now in a better position to back test the correlation of US rates of infection to paid claims in order to build an estimate for incurred claim reserves. \u2047 It's fair to say this is still very difficult to estimate as IBNR often works from years of reliable data to establish trends. \u2047 While our reserves assume elevated claims, we continue to see the length of stay in hospital and transition to ICU traveling below our expectations. \u2047 We have seen limited impact to our reported persistency numbers, however, we believe this is in part attributed to the combination of reduced sales where lapse rates tend to be much higher in the first year, and the state executive orders requiring premium grace periods. \u2047 Executive orders are still in place in 11 states as of the end of the quarter with 5 states having open-ended expiration dates. \u2047 We have reduced pressure on lapse rates through proactive work with our policyholders including converting from payroll deduction to direct bill and encouraging a review of wellness benefits. \u2047 Turning to key operating initiatives, 2020 was an important year in setting the stage for growth once we move clear of pandemic conditions. \u2047 Beginning with Japan after launching and promoting a simplified cancer rider in the 4th quarter, we successfully launched our refreshed medical product called EVER Prime in January. \u2047 As Dan noted in his comments, it's early and our associates channel is having to navigate pandemic conditions, but January medical sales are promising. \u2047 Introduced in October of 2020, we have technology in place to allow agents to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales and an entirely digital customer experience. \u2047 True virtual sales in Japan is relatively limited. \u2047 In addition, the majority of applications are still filed in paper form, although digital applications have been adopted in face-to-face consultations. \u2047 Excluding traditional non-face-to-face means of distributing products like worksite, direct mail and call center sales, we estimate only 2% to 3% of our sales are currently digital end-to-end. \u2047 However, we understand some of our agencies have significantly adopted virtual tools to supplement face-to-face consultations. \u2047 We have discussed our paperless initiative across all operations in Japan. \u2047 This is a JPY10 billion investment with approximately JPY2.8 billion spent in the fourth quarter and JPY4.8 billion spent in 2020. \u2047 We are projecting another JPY4.3 billion spend planned for 2021. \u2047 This investment has a 3-year payback and will reduce the production and circulation of over 80 million pieces of paper per year. \u2047 In summary, we expect the combination of product development, improved pandemic conditions and the return of Japan posed to distributing Aflac cancer insurance will drive growth as we look toward the second half of 2021. \u2047 Turning to the US, we focused our efforts in 2020 on setting the table for 2021, including a national launch of network, dental and vision completing our group benefit acquisition and standing up our new direct to consumer digital platform. \u2047 On the operation side, we rolled out a new and upgraded enrollment platform called Everwell 2.0 in September, which requires time for full adoption and stabilizing the platform. \u2047 2020 was an important year to introduce digital tools, increase adoption rates and take on any corrective action before 2021. \u2047 In addition, under Teresa White's leadership, we have reorganized the US forming a group benefits in individual division. \u2047 Rich Williams, will now lead our group benefits division, which includes Aflac voluntary group, Aflac network, dental, vision, Argus, our dental TPA and our new Aflac premier life, absence management and disability business. \u2047 Virgil Miller will lead our individual benefits division, which includes Aflac"],
