protect yourself and your family is to be vaccinated. \u2047 Although, demand for cleaning, disinfection and personal wash products has slowed from the pandemic peak, we had Stepan remain committed to doing our part by supporting customers that supply these essential products to the market. \u2047 The company had a good first half and delivered record results. \u2047 Adjusted net income was $84.6 million or $3.62 per diluted share. \u2047 Both adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were up 35% versus the first half of 2020, which was negatively impacted by the Millsdale plant outage. \u2047 We delivered our best second quarter and had $42.2 million adjusted net income. \u2047 Surfactant operating income was down 5%, largely due to higher North American supply chain cost, driven by inflationary pressures and planned higher maintenance cost. \u2047 Our Polymer operating income was up 48% on 44% sales volume growth. \u2047 The polymer growth was driven by both the INVISTA polyester polyol acquisition and organic market growth. \u2047 Overall, the integration of INVISTA's business into our company has gone well and is on track with our business plans. \u2047 Our Specialty Product business results were up due to order timing and improved margins within our MCT product line. \u2047 Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Stepan's common stock of $0.305 per share payable on September 15, 2021. \u2047 Stepan has increased its dividend for 53 consecutive years. \u2047 Luis will walk you through a few more details about our second quarter results. \u2047 Let's just start with the Slide four to recap the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $42.2 million or $1.81 per diluted share, a 10% increase versus $38.3 million or $1.65 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Specifically, adjustment to reported net income this quarter consists of adjustment for deferred compensation and minor restructuring expenses. \u2047 Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes deferred compensation income of $1.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to deferred compensation expense of $1.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the same period last year. \u2047 The deferred compensation numbers represent the net expense related to the company's deferred compensation plan as well as cash-settled stock appreciation rights for our employees. \u2047 These liabilities change with the movement in the stock price, we exclude this item from our operational discussion. \u2047 Slide five shows the total company earnings fees for the second quarter, compared to last year's second quarter and breaks down the increase in adjusted net income. \u2047 Because this is net income, the figure is noted here are on an after-tax basis. \u2047 We will cover each segment in more detail, but to summarize, Polymers and Specialty Products were up where Surfactant was down versus the prior year. \u2047 Corporate expenses and all others were higher during the quarter due to higher acquisition-related expenses and overall inflation. \u2047 The company's effective tax rate was 24.4% in the first half of 2021 compared to 23.9% in the prior year period. \u2047 This year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to a less favorable geographical mix of income. \u2047 We expect the full year 2021 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 26%. \u2047 The Slide six focuses on Surfactant segment results for the quarter. \u2047 Surfactant net sales were $384 million, a 16% increase versus the prior year. \u2047 Selling prices were up 17%, primarily due to improved product and customer mix as well as the pass-through of higher raw material costs. \u2047 Effect of foreign currency translation positively impacted net sales by 5%. \u2047 Volume decreased 6% year-over-year. \u2047 Most of this decrease reflects lower volume into the North America consumer product end market. \u2047 This reduction was driven by lower demand for consumer cleaning, disinfection and personal wash products versus the pandemic peak in 2020. \u2047 Additionally, we continue to experience feedstock supply issues and customer inventory rebalancing efforts. \u2047 This was partially offset by higher demand for products sold into our institutional cleaning and functional product end markets. \u2047 Surfactant operating income for the quarter decreased $2.6 million or 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher North America supply chain cost as a result of inflationary pressures and planned higher maintenance costs. \u2047 Latin America operating results benefit from a $2.1 million VAT tax recovery project in the current year quarter. \u2047 Europe results decreased slightly due to lower demand in consumer products, partially offset by increased demand in functional products. \u2047 Now turning to Polymers on Slide 7. \u2047 Net sales were $191 million in the quarter, up 70% from prior year. \u2047 Sales volume increased 44%, primarily due to 41% growth in Rigid Polyol volumes. \u2047 Global rigid polyol volumes, excluding the INVISTA acquisition, was up 7% versus the prior year. \u2047 Higher demand within the PA and Specialty Polyol businesses also contributed to the volume growth. \u2047 Selling prices increased 21% and the translation impact of a weaker U.S. dollar positively increased net sales by 5%. \u2047 Polymer operating income increased $7.5 million or 48%, primarily due to double-digit volume growth in the legacy polymers business plus INVISTA acquisition. \u2047 North America polyol results decreased due to rising raw materials and manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher volumes. \u2047 Europe results increased due to double-digit volume growth on the base business plus INVISTA acquisition. \u2047 China results decreased due to the nonrecurrence of a onetime benefit in the base period in 2020 and lower volumes. \u2047 China volumes in the first half of 2021 grew 5%. \u2047 Specialty Products net sales were $21 million for the quarter, up 33% from the prior year quarter. \u2047 Volume was up 17% between quarters, and operating income increased $3.8 million or 116%. \u2047 The operating income increase was primarily attributable to order timing differences within our food and flavor business and improved margins within our MCT product line. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 8. \u2047 Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity to invest in the business. \u2047 Our leverage and interest coverage ratios continues at very healthy levels. \u2047 We had a strong cash from operations in the first half of 2021, which was used for capex investments, dividends, share buybacks and investments in working capital, given the strong sales growth and raw material inflation. \u2047 We executed agreements for $100 million of new private placement debt at a very attractive and fixed interest rates of around 2%. \u2047 We will use a new cash to fund our organic and inorganic growth opportunities and for other general corporate purposes. \u2047 For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $150 million to $170 million. \u2047 Beginning on Slide 10, Scott will now update you on our 2021 strategic priorities. \u2047 We are pleased to have delivered record first half earnings to our shareholders and look forward to carrying that momentum into the second half of the year. \u2047 We continue to prioritize the safety and health of our employees as we deliver products that contribute to the fight against COVID-19. \u2047 Our EPA-approved biocide formulations kill a specific novel virus that causes COVID-19 and allow our customers to provide the public with additional tools to protect their families and to fight the pandemic. \u2047 Based on customer feedback, consumer habits have changed, and these new behaviors require higher use of disinfection, cleaning and personal wash products. \u2047 Therefore, we believe our surfactant volumes in the consumer product end market will remain higher versus pre-pandemic levels, however, lower than peak pandemic demand in Q2 of 2020. \u2047 We believe institutional cleaning volume will continue to grow as economies around the world reopen and people demand higher standards for cleaning and disinfection in public settings. \u2047 We also anticipate that demand for surfactants within the agricultural and oilfield markets will continue to benefit from higher agricultural and commodity prices and improve versus 2020. \u2047 We will continue working on improving productivity as well as product and customer mix to improve Surfactant operating income. \u2047 Globally, we are increasing capacity in certain product lines, including biocides and amphoteric to ensure we can meet higher requirements from our customers. \u2047 As discussed previously, we are increasing North American capability and capacity to produce low 1,4-dioxane sulfates, a minor byproduct generated in the manufacture of ether sulfate surfactants, which are key cleaning and foaming ingredients used in consumer product formulations. \u2047 Through a combination of process optimization and additional manufacturing equipment, Stepan will be prepared to supply customers ether sulfates that meet the new regulatory requirements. \u2047 This project is the primary driver of our 2021 capital expenditure forecast of $150 million to $170 million and will carry over to 2022 as well. \u2047 We are working with our customers to ensure these projects deliver our financial return targets. \u2047 Tier two and Tier three customers continue to be a focus of our strategy. \u2047 Tier two and Tier three volume grew in the second quarter, driven by increased customer penetration. \u2047 We added 150 new customers during the quarter and more than 500 customers in the first half of this year. \u2047 Our diversification strategy into functional markets continues to be a key priority for Stepan. \u2047 During the first half, global agricultural volume increased high single digits with strong growth obtained in the post-patent pesticide segment and new products launched throughout the world. \u2047 Oilfield volume was up mid-single digits due to higher oil prices. \u2047 We remain optimistic about future opportunities in this business as oil prices have recovered to the $70 per barrel level. \u2047 We continued our consulting work in our Millsdale plant and accelerated interventions and investments in both expense and capex to increase capacity and improved productivity. \u2047 We expect to continue this project and investment level throughout the rest of this year. \u2047 We are projecting a strong return on investment in this project through a combination of productivity improvements, more capacity in several high-margin product lines through debottlenecking key processes and improved service to our customers. \u2047 We anticipate starting to see the benefits of this project in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Polymers had a good quarter and first half of the year as the business is coming back from a challenging year due to COVID restrictions. \u2047 The long-term prospects for our polyol business remain attractive, as energy conservation efforts and more stringent building codes should increase demand. \u2047 As Quinn stated, the integration of this business acquired from INVISTA is going well, and we expect to deliver $16 million to $18 million of EBITDA in 2021. \u2047 Given the strength of our balance sheet, we also plan to continue to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities to fill gaps in our portfolio and to add new platform chemistries. \u2047 The company delivered record first half earnings in 2021. \u2047 Looking forward, we believe Surfactant volumes in North America consumer product end market will be challenged versus peak pandemic levels in 2020. \u2047 While we believe institutional cleaning volume will continue to grow versus prior year, we do not believe it will compensate for lower consumer consumption of cleaning, disinfection and personal wash products. \u2047 We anticipate that demand for Surfactants when the agricultural and oilfield markets will improve versus 2020. \u2047 Global demand for Rigid Polyols continues to recover from pandemic-related delays and cancellations of reroofing and new construction projects. \u2047 This recovery, combined with our first quarter 2021 acquisition, should position our polymer business to deliver growth versus prior year. \u2047 We believe that long-term prospects for Rigid Polyols remains attractive as energy conservation efforts and more stringent building codes are expected to continue. \u2047 We anticipate our Specialty Product business results will improve slightly year-over-year. \u2047 Despite continued raw material price increases and planned higher maintenance costs, we remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year. \u2047 Daisy, please review the instructions for the question portion of today's call.
