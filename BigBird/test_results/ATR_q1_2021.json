{"article": ["As always, we will also post a replay of this conference call on the website. \u2047 I would now like to turn the conference call over to Stephan. \u2047 I hope that you are doing well. \u2047 Starting on slide three, you will find a few highlights from the quarter. \u2047 We serve patients and consumers across a variety of end market. \u2047 And this makes after a resilient business through economic cycles. \u2047 In the most recent period is no exception. \u2047 We have the industry's widest range of dispensing systems, active material science solutions and drug delivery technologies and services that we leverage across our reporting segments. \u2047 Our customers benefit from our commitment to research and development, and the new innovations that allow us to help them grow their own businesses. \u2047 It has also maintained our strong focus on sustainability, and Aptar was recently named among the Top 10 companies for reducing environmental impact by JUST capital, alongside Dell, IBM, Microsoft, MasterCard, and several other large companies. \u2047 This is of course, compared to the first quarter of 2020 and COVID-19 was not yet the major factor in our quarterly results. \u2047 We also achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin comparable to the prior year, while absorbing the mix shift within our pharma segment and the relative mix across our three segments. \u2047 Our food and beverage segment deliver a stellar performance this quarter as consumers continue to cook at home during the pandemic, driving strong demand for our innovative food dispensing closures. \u2047 Price increases also contributed to our top line growth that we are passing on increased resin costs to our customers. \u2047 Demand from the beverage market was below the prior year. \u2047 Though sales grew modestly on the resin price adjustments. \u2047 In pharma the increased demand for our injectable components including supplying some of the COVID-19 vaccine distributions, and increased demand for our active material science solution, including those for COVID-19 test kits, offset declines in the prescription drug and consumer healthcare markets. \u2047 As we had mentioned when giving guidance for the quarter, fewer non-critical doctor visits and the lower incidence of cold and flu illnesses have resulted in certain pharma customers drawing down inventory levels of allergy and other respiratory treatment delivery devices. \u2047 We continue to be well positioned to niche healthcare sectors and receive these pandemic related supply chain adjustments as transitory. \u2047 In beauty and home, sales to the personal care and home care markets increase, while sales to the beauty market declined due to the continued low level of retail beauty activity related to the ongoing pandemic related lockdowns. \u2047 We are cautiously optimistic that the second half of the year will show a recovery in the beauty market. \u2047 We are also maintaining initiatives to contain costs and manage inflation that includes raising prices to offset increases in raw material and other costs, while investing in key growth areas including adding capacity to supply the beauty market in China. \u2047 Many of our customers remain optimistic that consumers are harboring pent-up demand for the beauty products that will help bring a feeling of normalcy to the lives post pandemic. \u2047 Turning to slide four, and new product launches, I would like to briefly comment on several product introductions that will highlight the breadth of our offerings. \u2047 In pharma, our active material science technology was selected to protect two new at-home COVID-19 tests that recently received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. \u2047 These tests provide convenient access to testing without the need to visit the doctor's office. \u2047 Our technology is integrated into these diagnostic kits to protect against moisture and other environmental conditions that would otherwise impact test accuracy. \u2047 In the prescription drug market, our unidose powder device is being used in a pivotal trial of intranasal powder-based Naloxone by Nasus Pharma. \u2047 Also landmark's new nasal spray treatment which combines an antihistamine with steroids to treat allergic rhinitis was recently approved in Europe with our nasal spray device. \u2047 This confirms that the ongoing conversion to nasal delivery continuous in this important area. \u2047 In the injectables market, we continue to support various COVID-19 vaccine distributions in all regions, with the most recent projects being added in India and Latin America. \u2047 In beauty and home, our E-commerce capable high-flow pump was chosen by P&G for their new indie brand shampoo called Native. \u2047 And our post-consumer recycled resin closure was selected by P&G for their planet KIND refreshing face wash. \u2047 We also supplying a PCR solution to Unilever for the Dove brand purifying charcoal and clove hydrating body wash. \u2047 In Europe we are providing the pump for in-store refillable personal care products in aluminum bottles for The Body Shop and our fragrance pump is featured on the Flora and Guilty Gucci perfumes by Coty. \u2047 Finally, L'Oreal is using our airless jar for its Revitalift facial skincare product in China. \u2047 In food and beverage after infant nutrition closure was selected for the Creme de la Creme, instant and rich milk powder for Europe and for HiPP combiotic in China. \u2047 Our closures with valves for inverted condiments are the dispensing solution for several barbeque, mayonnaise ketchup and jelly products in Brazil. \u2047 Also in the condiment aisle our dispensing food closures are featured on Mike's Hot Honey Original Sauce and Berman's Hot Sauce Original here in the U.S. Finally in the beverage market our sports closure is featured on two new flavors of a well-known functional drink beverage in China. \u2047 I will walk through some of the details around the first quarter performance, starting with slide five. \u2047 As Stephan stated, for the first quarter, we reported sales growth of 8%. \u2047 with core sales up 1%. \u2047 I will go into our growth by market shortly, but want to comment on our earnings first. \u2047 We reported earnings per share of $1.24, which is an increase of 48% over the prior year. \u2047 Current period reported earnings included a non-cash pre tax gain of $17 million or $0.19 per share related to an increase in the fair value of an equity investment. \u2047 This investment happens to be our investment in PureCycle Technologies, our strategic partner pursuing Ultra-Pure post-consumer resin that will one day be part of our circular economy. \u2047 Turning to slide six. \u2047 First quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding restructuring expenses, and the gain on the equity investment increased 10% to $1.09 per share on a comparable basis with the prior year, including adjusting for currency effects. \u2047 Our earnings also reflect certain tax benefits, including the tax deduction that we receive from stock-based compensation that as you know, can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. \u2047 Aptar's adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $152 million compared to the prior year. \u2047 And this included the positive effects of currency translation rates, as well as the impact of the shift in business across our markets and resin cost increases. \u2047 Briefly summarizing our segment results, our pharma business performance was mixed across the different divisions with total segment core sales even with the prior year, and then adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35%. \u2047 Looking at sales growth by market compared to the prior year, core sales to the prescription market decreased 8%. \u2047 And core sales to the consumer healthcare market decreased 1% for the reasons that Stephan mentioned earlier. \u2047 Core sales to the injectables market increased 14% with higher demand for our vaccine components. \u2047 Price accounted for approximately 2% of the total growth and about one-third of the remaining growth is from COVID related sales, mostly to supply vaccine distributions. \u2047 Core sales of our active material science solutions increased 5% primarily due to increase sales of our active containers used for probiotics. \u2047 Turning to our beauty and home segment, core sales decreased 3% and the segment's adjusted EBITDA margin was 10% in the quarter and was negatively impacted by increased resin and other raw material costs, which are passed through where possible, albeit through a process that has typically been on a 60 to 90-day lag. \u2047 With unit sales growth by market on a core basis, core sales to the beauty market decrease 10% due to continued localized lockdowns, especially in Europe, and global travel restrictions, which have caused a significant reduction in traditional retail, the duty free sales. \u2047 Core sales to the personal care market increased 2% due to continued strong demand for our hand sanitizer and liquid soap dispensers. \u2047 Wholesale to the homecare market increased 13% and strong demand for our cleaners and disinfectants, and some automotive products. \u2047 Turning to our food and beverage segment, which had a solid performance, core sales increased 14% in the segment achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 17% primarily due to the ongoing strength in the food market. \u2047 Looking at each market, core sales to the food market increased 19% as consumers continue to dine at home trend because of the pandemic. \u2047 Core sale for the beverage market increased 2%, primarily due to the pass-through of higher resin prices. \u2047 Moving to slide seven, which summarizes our outlook for the second quarter. \u2047 Current underlying demand conditions in most of our markets are not expected to change dramatically from what we experienced in the first quarter. \u2047 The anticipated demand for our prescription drug and consumer healthcare devices will remain under pressure compared to the prior year as customers continue to work off existing inventories. \u2047 However, in some of our other markets, including beauty, we will have easier comparisons to the prior year second quarter, which was the most difficult period when you consider the impact of pandemic lockdowns. \u2047 We expect a second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding restructuring and any change in the fair value of equity investments to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.99 per share. \u2047 The estimated tax rate range for the second quarter is 26% to 28%. \u2047 In closing, we continued to have a strong balance sheet with a leverage ratio of 1.4. \u2047 On a gross basis that the capital was approximately 37%. \u2047 On the net basis, it was approximately 31%. \u2047 In addition, we continue to invest in innovative growth projects, and we are confirming our forecasted range of capital expenditures for the year at a range of $300 million to $330 million. \u2047 At this time, Stephan will provide a few closing comments before we move to Q&A. \u2047 In closing, on slide eight, I'd like to mention that the broad range of end markets that we serve makes Aptar a very resilient company through economic cycles, and the most recent period was no exception. \u2047 The wide variety of technologies and solutions that we provide, combined with our commitment to R&D, and new innovative solutions will further build upon our solid customer pipeline. \u2047 We have a profound respect for the environment that drives lower energy consumption, landfill free facilities, and sustainable product designs, we will continue to advocate for a circular economy in which packaging is reused and recycled. \u2047 Therefore, our positive mid and long term view is unchanged. \u2047 And when we look past this global pandemic induced crisis, the future is quite promising. \u2047 We look forward to going after for the long term benefit of all stakeholders. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q1
