{"article": ["Today, we will discuss the financial performance of KAR Global for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. \u2047 After concluding our commentary, we will take questions from participants. \u2047 Let me also mention that throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Today on the call, we have Jim Hallett, Executive Chairman; Peter Kelly, CEO; and Eric Loughmiller, CFO. \u2047 Consistent with our announcement earlier this year, Peter Kelly has transitioned into the role of CEO of KAR Global beginning April 1. \u2047 It has been my pleasure getting to know so many of you and sharing KAR's story with you. \u2047 I also want to congratulate Peter Kelly and all of KAR on what I would call a seamless leadership transition. \u2047 Peter has been an inspirational leader in our company for over a decade and is a true industry pioneer. \u2047 He has been the architect of our digital transformation and has a clear bold vision for KAR's future, which I know he will begin sharing with you today. \u2047 This is the right time for this transition, and Peter is the right leader for our customers, for our investors and for our employees. \u2047 I appreciate that, Jim. \u2047 I will then provide some insights on the dynamics in our industry and what I believe we can expect to see over the rest of this year. \u2047 But I plan to spend most of my time focused on my vision for the future of KAR Global. \u2047 I'm going to start with the first quarter. \u2047 I was pleased with our first quarter performance. \u2047 Despite operating in an environment of constrained supply across our industry, we achieved the following results. \u2047 We facilitated the sale of 753,000 vehicles, representing gross auction proceeds of $11.4 billion. \u2047 We generated $582 million in total revenue and $489 million in net revenue. \u2047 We generated a total gross profit of $251 million, representing 51% of net revenue. \u2047 And we generated adjusted EBITDA of $123 million, an increase of 39% versus Q1 of last year. \u2047 Perhaps even more importantly, we saw our strongest performance to date by far in our digital dealer-to-dealer marketplaces, BacklotCars and TradeRev. \u2047 We completed the migration from TradeRev to BacklotCars in the U.S. in the first quarter ahead of our schedule. \u2047 On a combined basis, we facilitated the sale of over 100,000 vehicles on these marketplaces within Q1, representing growth of 81% compared to Q1 of 2020. \u2047 This is very encouraging. \u2047 Eric will provide more detail around these and other financial and operating results later in the call. \u2047 I would now like to speak to what we can expect over the rest of this year. \u2047 I mentioned that in Q1, we were operating in an environment of constrained vehicle supply across the wholesale used vehicle market. \u2047 This is particularly the case when it comes to the commercial vehicle category, affecting repossessed vehicles, off-lease vehicles and rental vehicles. \u2047 The root causes vary, but they all originate in the COVID pandemic. \u2047 These supply side dynamics for commercial vehicles are industrywide and they're not in our control. \u2047 However, there is a silver lining. \u2047 First, I believe that these dynamics are temporary and volumes will return to normal over time. \u2047 When that happens, I believe KAR will be a strong beneficiary given our market position, our technology platforms and our strong relationships with commercial consignors. \u2047 Until that happens, we will continue to run the business prudently recognizing and adjusting to the volumes that are available to us. \u2047 The dealer consignment category has been less impacted by these dynamics, although many dealers are more likely to keep their trade-in vehicles given the current high demand and prices on used vehicles. \u2047 So given that fact, I am even more encouraged by our strong performance in dealer consignment in the first quarter. \u2047 The second piece of good news is that even with these shortfalls in supply, our business continues to perform well. \u2047 We have meaningfully and permanently adjusted our cost structure and streamlined our operations in every corner of our organization. \u2047 This has enabled us to react to downward changes in the market, while remaining well prepared for when supply increases again. \u2047 A focus on cost management is part of our corporate culture, and it is important for us to continue to demonstrate strong unit economics during this period of supply constraint. \u2047 So with that, I'd like to spend the balance of my time sharing some perspectives on the business and what I believe is the significant opportunity that exists for KAR as we look to the future. \u2047 KAR operates leading used car digital marketplaces, serving business-to-business customers in North America and Europe. \u2047 We do this through an off-premise model, which means cars are launched for sale that are not physically at our sites, as well as through an on-premise model, which means cars are physically on our sites, to efficiently enable our business-to-business customers to sell, buy, service, transport and finance used vehicles. \u2047 We provide these services using our digital platforms, our proprietary data developed from tens of millions of transactions, our unique inspection tools and capabilities, our transport and logistics expertise, our ability to value and finance vehicles and our ability to store and service cars from a North American footprint of over 70 locations. \u2047 Core of this business are a long-standing relationships with dealers, motor manufacturers, finance companies, fleet operators and rental car companies. \u2047 And as you know, we report our business in two segments: ADESA and AFC. \u2047 As I see at the ADESA segment has two components. \u2047 The first component is our North American used vehicle marketplaces. \u2047 There were close to 20 million wholesale used vehicle transactions in the U.S. and Canada in 2020. \u2047 In our marketplaces, OPENLANE, BacklotCars, ADESA.com and TradeRev facilitated approximately three million of those. \u2047 The marketplace gross auction proceeds of those transactions was approximately $44 billion. \u2047 And we served over 30,000 unique sellers and over 60,000 unique buyers in 2020. \u2047 While we are number two in terms of our overall market share, we are number one in a number of important categories, such as our open lane powered private label marketplaces that support over 80% of North America's off-lease inventory. \u2047 The second component within ADESA is our international used vehicle marketplace. \u2047 We entered the European market some years ago through CarsOnTheWeb and via ADESA in the U.K. \u2047 We continue to pursue opportunities to serve our global customers and to grow our international presence and market share. \u2047 And within our AFC business segment, we are the number two by volume of loan transactions with total outstandings of $1.9 billion. \u2047 We provided 1.5 million loans to over 14,000 dealer customers in 2020. \u2047 With that as a backdrop, I'd like to comment on our strategy. \u2047 And I'm going to focus the remainder of my remarks today on the North American marketplaces, and I will cover AFC and International in future calls. \u2047 So the market for buying and selling used vehicles is undergoing significant change. \u2047 Our customers are evolving. \u2047 Some are eager to embrace the power of digital technology and the shift to digital marketplaces that COVID has accelerated. \u2047 Other customers are adapting to transition to off-premise sales more slowly. \u2047 Our goal is to provide all customers, buyers and sellers with a full range of capabilities to meet their needs and to help them to be more successful. \u2047 Today, we are no longer running vehicles in lane, and we have no plans to do so. \u2047 However, we have the ability to inspect and launch for sale vehicles from any location or alternative to bring them to any of our 70-plus sites to store, inspect and if need be, service them before selling them. \u2047 As a result of this, 100% of the cars we sold in Q1 were sold digitally, and 54% of them were sold off-premise compared to 46% sold off-premise a year ago. \u2047 I know that some investors are concerned that this shift to digital could erode our profit margins. \u2047 I would point out that we were able to increase our gross profit per vehicle sold in the ADESA segment to $264 in Q1 of this year versus $228 in Q1 of last year and $242 in Q1 of 2019. \u2047 I believe digital marketplaces are the future of the business-to-business vehicle marketing industry and that they offer superior outcomes for customers. \u2047 Some competing auctions are running cars in lane, appealing to what was familiar to buyers and sellers pre-pandemic. \u2047 However, this gives us an opportunity to run real-life experiments to demonstrate to buyers and sellers that our digital marketplaces offer superior outcomes for both sides. \u2047 Benefits of our digital marketplace model include: for buyers, greater convenience, greater choice and selection and lower costs; for sellers, increased buyer participation with more buyers viewing and bidding on your vehicles, greater geographical reach, reduced days to sale, reduce time to cash and improve proceeds. \u2047 While off-premise sales are likely to continue to increase, and we are well positioned for this, there is still a role for bringing vehicles on-premise to our facilities and for providing related services. \u2047 This is particularly true for commercial sellers, who have the greater need for these services and who have typically been the principal customers for these services in the past. \u2047 So this leads me to our overall competitive position and our points of differentiation. \u2047 Wholesale automotive industry remains a network effect business, where like any other marketplace business, scale and breadth of capabilities to get success. \u2047 In this context, my belief is KAR is better positioned than anybody else. \u2047 We offer buyers and sellers a broader set of marketplace offerings tailored to their specific needs. \u2047 For example, The OPENLANE platform provides our OEM and captive finance customers with a highly customizable platform for their marketing of their off-lease vehicles. \u2047 Our BacklotCars and TradeRev marketplaces are also strongly differentiated platforms for the off-premise dealer segment in their respective geographies. \u2047 We believe that our physical infrastructure is a strong differentiator and will remain one even in the more digital world of the future. \u2047 We offer the ability to sell cars either on-premise or off-premise. \u2047 And we have the capability to deliver value-enhancing services, such as detailing, reconditioning and vehicle repair for those vehicles at our facilities. \u2047 We also offer our customers a larger base of market participants and counterparties, meaning more buyers and more sellers, and a broader suite of ancillary services, such as transportation, financing, buy back guarantee products, etc. \u2047 Finally, the data from our entire digital marketplace with over three million vehicle sales transactions annually, creates unique opportunities for our business. \u2047 So when I think about our competitive position, I think we have a strong positive differentiation in the eyes of our customers. \u2047 Versus our physical auction competitors, KAR offers superior digital capabilities, with best-in-class offerings, such as BacklotCars, TradeRev, OPENLANE, Simulcast Plus. \u2047 We strengthened these digital capabilities further this week with the acquisition of Auction Frontier. \u2047 Finally, we also have considerably broader reach than any stand-alone independent auction versus newer vendors who offer point solutions for the digital off-premise dealer segment. \u2047 Just looking at that off-premise dealer segment by itself, we have a similar scale to our leading competitor. \u2047 But taking the market as a whole, we have considerably more scale. \u2047 We also offer our buyers and sellers a broader set of marketplace offerings, a choice of on-premise or off-premise, a larger base of counterparties, a broader suite of ancillary services, such as reconditioning, transportation, land, data, financing, etc. \u2047 So I'd like to speak to where we're going to as a company and to our key initiatives. \u2047 In the simplest form, we intend to grow our volumes and grow our share. \u2047 The automotive marketplace is large and relatively stable. \u2047 Total new and used vehicle retail transactions in the United States alone amount to 50 million to 60 million vehicle transactions in most years. \u2047 We estimate well over 20 million retail -- used vehicle trade-in transactions per year as well. \u2047 And also another 20 million wholesale used vehicle transactions. \u2047 We believe that a more digital model significantly expands our addressable market to include all of the approximately 20 million wholesale used vehicle transactions currently taking place each year and potentially vehicles in some of the other marketplace categories. \u2047 So we will be focused on growing our volumes and increasing our share in this larger addressable market that now exists for our services. \u2047 We also aim to achieve a tighter integration of services across our marketplace platforms. \u2047 We'll create a one-of-a-kind value proposition for buyers and sellers. \u2047 Today, we have a number of best-in-class technology and data capabilities and other service offerings that may be only available on select platforms that we offer. \u2047 We are working to integrate those across all of our platforms so that all of our customers can benefit from them. \u2047 Digital will also allow for a more streamlined cost structure for our operations. \u2047 We will preserve the digital sales model that we have transitioned to during COVID, and I believe this will allow us to sustain the cost reductions that we have already achieved. \u2047 However, we will also continue to adjust our fixed cost structure to reflect the fact that as we grow our business, an increasing percentage of our sales will likely be off-premise. \u2047 We will constantly evaluate where we have had the opportunity to become more efficient and where we need to invest to accelerate our growth. \u2047 Our physical auctions of the past will evolve into our vehicle logistics centers of the future. \u2047 We also intend to grow our ancillary services businesses, including AFC, by increasing the cross-selling and increasing the attach rate for these services on the vehicles sold within our marketplaces. \u2047 Greater use of our services by existing customers provide a meaningful opportunity for financial growth, and I believe that digital will help raise awareness, interest, engagement and the attach rate of these offerings by our customers. \u2047 We intend to measure and report on our progress using our fresh set of key metrics that reflect our transition to a digital marketplace company. \u2047 There are five key metrics that we will use for the ADESA segment. \u2047 The first metric is total vehicles sold and total gross auction proceeds. \u2047 In Q1, we sold 753,000 vehicles, representing $11.4 billion in proceeds. \u2047 Notwithstanding the near-term supply constraints that I discussed earlier, our intention is to grow our volume of vehicles transacted over time. \u2047 We will measure our performance based on growing the volume of cars sold in the aggregate across all of our"], "gold_summary": ["q1 revenue fell 10 percent to $581.6 million.  \u2047  previously stated 2021 guidance remains unchanged."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share of $11.4.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $11.4.  \u2047  q1 revenue $11.4 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $11.4 billion."]}
