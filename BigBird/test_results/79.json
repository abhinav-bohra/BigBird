{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. \u2047 We plan to release fiscal 2021 first quarter earnings on September 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. \u2047 It has been 14 weeks since our last earnings call. \u2047 I don't know about all of you, but it's felt more like 14 months. \u2047 So much has happened. \u2047 Over the past three months, our businesses -- our business changed in ways we never imagined. \u2047 Then Rick will share some of our fourth quarter and year-end results and provide our outlook for the first quarter. \u2047 When I look back on all that has transpired, one thing that stands out is the resiliency of the full-service dining industry. \u2047 Prior to the pandemic, total annual sales for the casual dining industry was approximately $108 billion. \u2047 And while I do not know how long it will take the industry to recover from the significant impact it experienced, I am confident that this category will get back to the size it once was. \u2047 Our industry plays a vital role in our communities, and that was evident in how the consumer relied on restaurants over the last several months, even in a To Go only environment. \u2047 And while on-premise will continue to play an important role as we recover, we know that the consumer still wants to enjoy and in-restaurant experience. \u2047 In fact, going out to a restaurant with friends and family is the number one activity consumers say they look forward to doing as the economy opens back up. \u2047 And we've seen that as our dining rooms reopen across the country. \u2047 As this vital industry continues to rebuild, there's tremendous opportunity to increase market share through increased on-premise demand and incremental off-premise sales. \u2047 Those executing at the highest level are going to continue to win, and Darden is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. \u2047 When we last spoke in March, we knew the pandemic was going to have a significant impact on our business. \u2047 Our ability to manage through this crisis has been driven by our commitment to prioritize guest and team member safety, invest in our team members, provide frequent and transparent communication, leverage our digital platform, and be brilliant with the basics. \u2047 The health and safety of our guest and team members has always been our top priority, and we have taken a number of steps to create a safe environment in our restaurants. \u2047 From sourcing mask and other personal protective equipment for our team members, to developing a contactless curbside pickup process, our brands -- at our brands while dining rooms were closed. \u2047 We are mindful of the trust our guest and team members place in us. \u2047 Today, our health and safety commitments are focused on team member health checks, personal protective equipment, enhanced sanitation processes, social distancing and frequent hand-washing. \u2047 We also provide paid sick leave for all our team members so they can stay at home if they are real[Phonetic]. \u2047 But we can't do it alone, and that's why we encourage our guests to join the online wait list or make reservations, not enter our restaurants if they are symptomatic, wear a mask and utilize contactless or mobile payment options where available. \u2047 We continued to invest in our team members as our dining rooms closed. \u2047 In addition to rolling out permanent paid sick leave, we introduced a three-week emergency pay program that provided nearly $75 million of pay during the fourth quarter for our hourly team members who could not work. \u2047 When emergency pay ended, we covered insurance payments and benefit deductions for hourly team members who were furloughed. \u2047 As we brought hourly team members back to work to support increased To Go volume, we introduced an additional payment to help cover unexpected costs such as transportation and child care incurred as a result of the pandemic. \u2047 And to recognize the unbelievable work our managers did during the quarter, we paid their target bonus for the fourth quarter. \u2047 We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage. \u2047 Not only were these investments the right thing to do to take care of our team members, they've also created a deeper loyalty and strengthened engagement, while we've seen this pay off as we bring our people back to work. \u2047 Communication is the most important aspect of leadership during a crisis. \u2047 We knew frequent and transparent communication with our team members and investors was important. \u2047 Beyond daily meetings with all of our brand Presidents, who in turn met with their operational leaders on a daily basis, we have maintained a consistent communication cadence with our team members. \u2047 Since this crisis began, I've provided regular business updates to our people and had been open and honest about the impacts to our business and consequently the impacts to them. \u2047 We took the same approach with our shareholders and the analysts by providing four business updates during the quarter. \u2047 The pandemic accelerate the consumers' desire for convenience, and we saw a significant increase in digital engagement. \u2047 The work we have done over the past few years, investing in our digital platform to reduce friction, prepared us to quickly adapt to consumer behavior and deliver on their expectations of convenience in a To Go only environment. \u2047 During this time, we have strengthened our digital platform and made meaningful progress against our digital strategy. \u2047 In addition to improving the guest experience across our digital channels, our strategy is focused on using technology to help our guest easily order outside and inside the restaurant, improve the wait to be seated, streamline the order pick-up process and speed up how they pay. \u2047 We've been building on our digital platform to support increased demand, and we certainly tested like never before. \u2047 During the quarter, online ordering at Olive Garden grew by more than 300% over prior year and accounted for 58% of To Go sales. \u2047 At LongHorn, online ordering grew by 400% and accounted for 49% of the gross sales. \u2047 Additionally, we accelerated our timeline and rolled out online ordering at our brands that had not yet deployed it. \u2047 We also added the ability to order alcohol online for all of our brands and markets where that was allowed. \u2047 Our commitment to being brilliant with the basics allowed us to remain focused on operational execution, even as the environment forced us to radically change how we serve our guest. \u2047 Each one of our brands did a phenomenal job delivering a new guest experience by collaborating and sharing best practices. \u2047 This involved creating contactless curbside pickup that included designing what was essentially a drive-through in our parking lots. \u2047 Flawless[Phonetic] execution in this environment meant enabling our guests to order and pay online and have our team members seamlessly place their sealed orders in their vehicles. \u2047 Our operators displayed tremendous innovation, flexibility and passion as they continued to serve our guests. \u2047 And to ensure we consistently executed at the highest level, we took the opportunity to streamline our menus and improve our processes and procedures. \u2047 With these changes, we are seeing improvements in execution and direct labor productivity. \u2047 So, what have we learned from all this? \u2047 We've learned a lot, but most importantly, this situation has reinforced that our strategy that we developed five years ago, grounded in our back to basics operating philosophy, leveraging our four competitive advantages and cultivating a portfolio of iconic brands, is still the right one today. \u2047 Strong brands with loyal guests have fared better, and the trust we have earned from our guest is critical. \u2047 Being brilliant with the basics by consistently delivering exceptional food, service and atmosphere is imperative. \u2047 However, we know how important safety and cleanliness are to our guests right now, and we must continue to earn their trust every day. \u2047 And throughout this unprecedented time, we have benefited greatly from our four competitive advantages: our significant scale, our extensive data and insights, our regular strategic planning, and our culture. \u2047 Whether sourcing PPE for our team members, ensuring we're not impacted by supply chain issues or sharing best practices across eight brands, the ability to leverage our scale has allowed us to quickly react to constant change. \u2047 Finally, as I said earlier, we know our people are our greatest competitive advantage, and I'm impressed by how our team members responded and continue to respond to take care of our guests and each other. \u2047 Having a strong culture has been part of our DNA since we were founded. \u2047 We were able to keep the majority of our managers employed, and we stay connected with our furloughed hourly team members. \u2047 This allowed us to bring our people back quickly and get our dining rooms open safely without any delays. \u2047 We have also brought 60,000 furloughed restaurant team members back to work, and we expect to bring at least another 40,000 back as business continues to improve. \u2047 I'm incredibly proud that our culture has actually strengthened during this most difficult period in our company's history. \u2047 This, above all else, is what gives me confidence in Darden's future. \u2047 Fiscal 2020 was on track for a solid year of performance, and the beginning of Q4 was no different. \u2047 The first few weeks of sales were strong. \u2047 And then, nearly overnight, the impact of COVID-19 required us to pivot toward a To Go only format. \u2047 This posed unprecedented challenges for our restaurant and support center teams, and I am proud of how everyone moved quickly to increase To Go sales, reduce costs, manage working capital and improve efficiency. \u2047 The simplifications Gene referenced helped reduce key variable expenses in our restaurants, especially direct labor. \u2047 The teams also worked to reduce or eliminate other fixed costs in our restaurants and restaurant support center, as well as eliminate non-essential capital spending. \u2047 Given the significant reduction in cash flow, we also had to work quickly to ensure we had enough cash for whatever might occur. \u2047 During the quarter, we suspended the dividend and share repurchases, fully drew down our $750 million credit facility, took out a $270 million term loan and raised over $500 million in a follow-on equity offering. \u2047 All these efforts and the strong loyalty of our guests resulted in us tripling our prior To Go sales run rate averages and materially reducing our cash burn as we disclosed to you through our periodic business updates. \u2047 Given the confidence in our cash flow trends and the ability to access it in the future, we fully repaid our credit facility in early May. \u2047 Now turning to the results, the total sales were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 43%. \u2047 Same restaurant sales decreased 47.7%, and adjusted diluted net loss per share was $1.24. \u2047 Because of the significant reduction in total sales compared to last year, all of the expense lines experienced sales deleverage. \u2047 So, I'll just touch on a few highlights. \u2047 First, food and beverage costs were higher as a percent of sales, given menu mix related to both To Go mix and simplified menus, as well as increased packaging expense and elevated beef costs. \u2047 As we look at the labor line, there was significant deleverage in management labor, including approximately $25 million in manager bonuses. \u2047 However, we saw an improvement in hourly labor as a percent of sales of over 150 basis points, even with a substantial reduction in sales. \u2047 Restaurant expenses per operating week decreased over 20%, given our focus on cost management, even as we incurred over $5 million in incremental cleaning supplies and PPE related to COVID-19. \u2047 For marketing and G&A expense, we were able to reduce the absolute spend by $37 million and $17 million respectively versus last year. \u2047 Included in our restaurant labor and to a small extent G&A is approximately $50 million of investments net of retention credits. \u2047 This was related to emergency and furlough pay for our team members while they were not working. \u2047 This negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.30, which was not adjusted out of reported earnings. \u2047 During the quarter, we impaired $390 million of assets as a result of lower sales, reduced profitability and lower market capitalization. \u2047 The impairments related to $314 million of Cheddar's goodwill and trademark assets, $47 million of restaurant level assets and $29 million of other assets. \u2047 We permanently closed 11 restaurants in the quarter, six of which were already impaired. \u2047 The entire $300 million -- $390 million of impairment charges were adjusted out of our reported earnings. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $763 million in cash and another $750 million available in our credit facility. \u2047 This gives us over $1.5 billion of liquidity available to weather the crisis and make appropriate investments to grow profitably. \u2047 Our adjusted debt to adjusted capital at the end of the quarter was 61%, well within our debt covenant of 75%. \u2047 As we shifted to an off-premise only model, we took a disciplined approach to pursue sales opportunities with an eye toward incremental profitability and cash flow, by focusing on cost management and the guest experience, while ensuring our team members were taken care of. \u2047 This approach resulted in a better finish to Q4 than anticipated and is the underpinning for the strength of our business model that is reflected in our first quarter financial outlook. \u2047 Now, turning to fiscal 2021 performance, in today's release, we provided quarter-to-date same restaurant sales and the performance of our restaurants with dining rooms at least partially open. \u2047 These results are encouraging. \u2047 With last week's blended same restaurant sales down 30%, we are operating cash flow positive at these levels. \u2047 Our To Go sales remain elevated in restaurants with dining rooms at least partially reopened. \u2047 Olive Garden To Go sales are approximately double their pre-COVID averages and LongHorn has more than tripled their pre-COVID averages in these restaurants. \u2047 While it is our normal practice to provide an annual financial outlook, due to the uncertainty in business performance moving forward, we are only providing an outlook for the first quarter. \u2047 We expect to achieve approximately 70% of prior year sales levels, total EBITDA of at least $75 million and diluted net earnings per share of greater than or equal to zero on a diluted share base of 131 million shares. \u2047 At this point, we don't intend to further share intra-quarter business updates since we have provided our first quarter outlook. \u2047 For the full year, we intend to open between 35 and 40 net new restaurants. \u2047 Our first opening of the year is expected to be in early July with a few others likely to be opened by the end of the first quarter. \u2047 In total, we expect between $250 million and $350 million of capital spending for fiscal '21. \u2047 Turning to other aspects of capital allocation, as you recall, we suspended our dividend last quarter due to the level of cash flow uncertainty and the need to preserve as much cash as possible. \u2047 We have been consistent in our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, and our dividend is a big part of that. \u2047 As soon as we see the business begin to generate the sustainable cash flows to support a dividend and repay our term loan, we will have discussions with our Board on"], "gold_summary": ["q4 sales $1.27 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $1.24 billion.  \u2047  q4 adjusted non-gaap loss per share $1.24
