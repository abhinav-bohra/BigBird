{"article": ["Chief Investment Officer Greg Wright, Chief Technology Officer Chris Sharp, and Chief Revenue Officer Corey Dyer are also on the call and will be available for Q&A. \u2047 For further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. \u2047 Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. \u2047 We further strengthened connections with customers, landing record new logos and delivering our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 million of bookings. \u2047 We also continued to deliver for our customers around the world despite volatility in the global supply chain, leveraging our scale, diversification, and strategic procurement processes to continue to deliver on time and on budget for our customers. \u2047 We continued to enhance our global platform by expanding into new markets with tremendous growth potential while continuing to expand capacity in existing markets around the world. \u2047 We delivered solid financial results, with double-digit revenue growth, leading to a beat in the current quarter and a race to the outlook for the balance of the year. \u2047 Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by raising approximately $600 million of low coupon Swiss green bonds and over $1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth. \u2047 Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework, and we made further progress on each front during the third quarter. \u2047 We continued to globalize our business, with significant bookings and solid performance across regions. \u2047 Our bookings were diversified by both region and product type, reflecting our unique, full-spectrum global product offering. \u2047 We also announced our entry into two high potential emerging markets, India and Nigeria, during the third quarter while expanding our connectivity capabilities by working with Zayo to develop the largest open fabric-of-fabrics that will interconnect key centers of data exchange. \u2047 We are also extending our capabilities for customers to the edge with the announcement of what will be one of a few strategic partnerships in this arena. \u2047 Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. \u2047 During the third quarter, Digital Realty was honored to be recognized by GRESB as an overall global sector leader in the technology and science category for exemplary ESG performance, receiving a coveted five-star rating from this leading global ESG benchmarking organization and reflecting Digital Realty's commitment to being a global leader in ESG. \u2047 We also became a U.N. Global Compact signatory in September, aligning our ESG goals and commitment to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals with a global initiative. \u2047 We also advanced our sustainable financing strategy, raising our first-ever Swiss green bonds and publishing the allocation of $440 million of proceeds from our September 2020 Euro green bond, which funded sustainable data center development projects in four countries across three continents, certified in accordance with leading sustainable rating standards. \u2047 We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors, our employees, and broader society while advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all of these stakeholders. \u2047 While on the topic of energy, I'm pleased to report that Digital Realty experienced only a small negative impact from the substantial rise in energy costs during the third quarter. \u2047 In Europe, where concerns of an energy crisis were most acute, we typically contract for energy supplies a year or more in advance, providing price visibility and certainty for our customers. \u2047 Elsewhere around the world, energy costs are typically passed through to customers, minimizing our direct exposure. \u2047 We continue to keep a close eye on energy prices. \u2047 But given the resiliency of our business model, we do not expect rising energy costs to impact our reported results by more than a few pennies. \u2047 Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. \u2047 We continue to invest in our global platform. \u2047 As previously announced, we entered into a joint venture with Brookfield to expand PlatformDIGITAL into India, a giant underserved market, with the fifth largest GDP in the world. \u2047 Like many emerging markets, India presents some unique challenges, underscoring the need for local knowledge and experience. \u2047 To that end, we were pleased to announce the hiring of Seema Ambastha as CEO for the India joint venture. \u2047 Seema has years of experience in the Indian IT sector broadly and in the data center industry specifically where she most recently served as a senior executive leader with the NTT Netmagic data center business across India. \u2047 We believe the India data center market has the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade, and we're thrilled to have such a strong partner and strong leader in this exciting new venture. \u2047 During the third quarter, we continued to expand iColo, our Kenyan data center operator, acquiring a land parcel in Mozambique to build a facility position to land subsea cables and other connectivity-focused customers. \u2047 We also acquired a controlling interest in Medallion Communications, the leading colocation and interconnection provider in Nigeria, in partnership with our existing African partner, Pembani Remgro. \u2047 As the African internet economy matures, we expect Nigeria will represent a significant growth opportunity given its large and relatively young population, a growing and diversifying economy, as well as a maturing regulatory environment. \u2047 Given the connectivity Africa from our existing hub in Marseille, our platform will now offer the market-leading destinations, connecting Africa to Europe and beyond. \u2047 We're also investing to organically expand our capacity. \u2047 As of September 30, we had 44 projects underway around the world, totaling almost 270 megawatts of incremental capacity, with over 250 megawatts scheduled for delivery before the end of 2022. \u2047 We continue to invest most heavily in EMEA, where we now have 27 projects underway in 15 different markets, totaling 150 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is highly connected, including significant expansions in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris, and Zurich. \u2047 Our investment in organic development is a reflection of the strength of demand across EMEA. \u2047 We're being a bit more selective in North America. \u2047 We're seeing strong demand in Portland, where we have a 30-megawatt facility under construction that is 100% preleased and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year, while we also have significant projects underway in Northern Virginia, New York, and Toronto. \u2047 Finally, in Asia-Pacific, we continue to pursue strong, organic development, both on our own and with our joint venture partners. \u2047 We are adding capacity in Hong Kong that will open this quarter and expect to open Korea's first carrier-neutral facility in Seoul in early 2022. \u2047 We are building a connected campus in Seoul to provide the full spectrum of solutions for our customers. \u2047 The larger second facility will accommodate up to 64 megawatts of capacity and will be located within 25 kilometers of our first facility. \u2047 Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. \u2047 We are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, and our leadership position provides us with unique vantage point to detect developing trends as they emerge globally on PlatformDIGITAL. \u2047 Just over a year ago, we introduced the Data Gravity Index, our market intelligence tool that forecasts the growing intensity of the enterprise data creation lifecycle and its gravitational impact on global IT infrastructure. \u2047 Earlier this year, we published an industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities to guide cross-industry collaboration, tackle data gravity head-on, and unlock a new era of growth opportunity. \u2047 Recent third-party research continues to support the growing relevance of data gravity. \u2047 According to ITC, the amount of digital data created over the next five years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage. \u2047 This digital data creation is expected to drive exponential growth in enterprise user data aggregation, storage, and exchange, providing a powerful tailwind for data center demand. \u2047 We continue to see enterprise and service provider customers deploying their own data hubs and using interconnection to securely exchange data in multiple metros on PlatformDIGITAL to accommodate their own data creation growth. \u2047 Recently, for the second consecutive year, Digital Realty was ranked as the only outperformer and global leader by GigaOm for edge colocation. \u2047 This ranking reflects our continued innovation and the execution of our PlatformDIGITAL roadmap for delivering global differentiated capabilities and value for our customers and partners. \u2047 We are honored by the strong validation of our platform and our market-leading innovation to capture the growing global demand opportunity from data-driven businesses. \u2047 Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. \u2047 For the second straight quarter, we signed total bookings of 113 million. \u2047 This time, with a 12 million contribution from interconnection. \u2047 Deal mix was consistent with the prior four-quarter average, sub-1 megawatt deals plus interconnection represented about 40% of the total, while larger deals represented around 60%. \u2047 Space and power bookings were also well diversified by region, with EMEA and APAC contributing 45% of our total, about the same as the Americas, with interconnection accounting for the remaining 10%. \u2047 The weighted average lease term was a little over five and a half years, and we landed a record 140 new logos during the third quarter, with strong showings across all regions, demonstrating the power of our global platform. \u2047 In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, a leading cloud-native cybersecurity platform is expanding its high-performance computing capabilities by leveraging PlatformDIGITAL in four markets across North America and Europe, connecting with cloud providers, improving performance, and driving down cost. \u2047 A market-leading autonomous driving technology developer partnering with Digital Realty to tailor an innovative and unique infrastructure solution for simulation workloads. \u2047 Two major North American energy firms chose Digital Realty to leverage our geographic reach and rearchitect their network to interconnect with cloud providers and implement security controls as part of their hybrid IT strategy. \u2047 A public university in the Eastern U.S. is launching a Global Research Initiative with other universities in EMEA and deploying PlatformDIGITAL network hubs across two continents in three cities to help enable this project. \u2047 A maker of high-performance computing systems is expanding their footprint by deploying on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions to guarantee GDPR compliance while enhancing their security, performance, and sustainability. \u2047 And finally, a Global 500 fintech provider is expanding their own hybrid IT availability zones into multiple new metros, using PlatformDIGITAL to support their data-intensive and high-performance computing requirements. \u2047 Turning to our backlog on Page 9. \u2047 The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from 303 million to 330 million, and our third-quarter signings more than offset commencements. \u2047 The lag between signings and commencements was down slightly from last quarter at just over seven months. \u2047 Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. \u2047 We signed 223 million of renewal leases during the third quarter, our largest ever renewal quarter, in addition to new leases signed. \u2047 The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the quarter was a little over three and a half years. \u2047 Renewal rates for sub-1 megawatt deals remain consistently positive, greater than the megawatt renewals were skewed by our largest deal of the core that combined a sizable 30-megawatt renewal with our largest new deal for the quarter, which will land entirely in existing currently vacant or soon to be vacant capacity across Chicago and Ashburn. \u2047 Excluding this one transaction, our cash mark-to-market would have been a positive 1%. \u2047 This multifaceted transaction was a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management. \u2047 We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer that we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. \u2047 And whenever we can, we try to ride a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business, as well as renewals. \u2047 In terms of first-quarter operating performance, reported portfolio occupancy ticked down by 50 basis points, largely driven by the sale of fully leased assets during the quarter. \u2047 Upon commencement of the large combination renewal expansion list I mentioned a moment ago, portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 70 basis points. \u2047 Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 5.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a spike in property taxes in Chicago, where local assessors have adopted a very aggressive posture, along with the impact of the Ashburn churn event in January. \u2047 Of the 70 megawatts we got back on January 1st, approximately 80% has since been released to multiple large and growing customers. \u2047 As a reminder, the Westin Building in Seattle, the Interxion platform in EMEA, Lamda Hellix in Greece, and Altus IT in Croatia are not yet included in the same-store pool. \u2047 So, these same capital comparisons are less representative of our underlying business today than usual. \u2047 And while we're still in the early stages of our budgeting process, we are optimistic in terms of where our same-store and allied growth goals for 2022. \u2047 Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11. \u2047 The U.S. dollar strengthened during the third quarter, providing a small FX headwind in the third quarter. \u2047 As a reminder, we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. \u2047 Our Swiss green bond offering during the quarter is a good example of this. \u2047 In addition to managing credit risk and foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed-rate financing. \u2047 Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100-basis-point move in[Inaudible] would have approximately a 50-basis-point impact on full-year FFO per share. \u2047 Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded. \u2047 In terms of earnings growth, third-quarter core FFO per share was up 7% on both a year over year and sequential basis, driven by strong operational execution, cost controls, and a reduction in financing costs from the debt refinancings and redemptions of preferred stock over the past year. \u2047 To avoid any confusion, our core FFO outperformance excludes the benefit of a nearly $20 million promote fee received in connection with the monetization of our joint venture with Prudential. \u2047 Heading into the final quarter of the year, we have solid momentum, so we are raising our full-year outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and core FFO per share to reflect this underlying momentum in our business. \u2047 Last but certainly not"], "gold_summary": ["q3 revenue rose 11 percent to $1.1 billion."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share of $0.45.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $0.45.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $0.45."]}
