{"article": ["I am joined by Tom Greco, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Shepherd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 I hope you and your families are healthy and safe amid all that we've endured over the past 12 months. \u2047 Here at Advance, we are incredibly grateful for the way our entire team persevere. \u2047 When the reality of COVID-19 defended on our communities in March of 2020, we found ways across AAP to meet new unfamiliar challenges with innovation and agility. \u2047 As an essential business, their efforts have been critical to keep America moving during a time of great needs. \u2047 As you've heard from us throughout this pandemic, we remain focused on three overarching priorities. \u2047 First, protect the health, safety and well being of our team members and customers. \u2047 Second, preserve cash and protect the P&L during the crisis. \u2047 And third, prepare to be even stronger following the crisis. \u2047 Our results in Q4 and for the full year demonstrate that our unwavering focus on these priorities has enabled meaningful progress toward our long-term goals. \u2047 From the beginning, we've invested in compensation for our frontline and distribution center team members, enhanced benefits, cleaning, personal protective equipment and innovative ways to serve our customers. \u2047 This helped ensure that our team members and customers feel safe coming into work and to shop. \u2047 Our store and distribution center team members continuously stepped up throughout the year, and they are the true heroes for us. \u2047 In spite of many obstacles for our team, we saw significant improvements in organizational health and increased engagement scores throughout the year. \u2047 Fundamentally, we are building trust in the Advance brand at an enduring time for the world and one that our team members and customers will always remember. \u2047 We're confident our COVID-19-related investments, which we believe will subside over time, are strengthening our employment brand, our customer brand and our corporate reputation for the long-term. \u2047 In Q4, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 4.7% and margin expansion of 17 basis points. \u2047 This includes an 82 basis point headwind related to COVID-19. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share improvement of 14% to $1.87, including a $0.22 headwind related to COVID-19. \u2047 For the full year, we delivered top-line growth resulting in record net sales of $10.1 billion. \u2047 Adjusted operating income improvement of 4.1% to $827.3 million, including a $60 million headwind related to COVID-19. \u2047 Record adjusted diluted earnings per share of $8.51, including a $0.66 headwind related to COVID-19. \u2047 And we also returned $515 million to shareholders through share repurchases and our continued quarterly cash dividend. \u2047 Jeff will cover more on the details of our financials shortly, but first, let's review our operational performance. \u2047 COVID-19-related factors continued to affect channel performance in Q4 across our industry. \u2047 DIY omnichannel led the way, as it has since Q2. \u2047 It's well documented that consumers are spending more of their time at home, likely contributing to the shift in discretionary spending from services to goods. \u2047 Given economic uncertainty and elevated unemployment, many consumers are choosing lower cost options for vehicle repairs and maintenance, benefiting our DIY omnichannel business. \u2047 Our professional business continued to recover with positive comp sales in both Q3 and Q4. \u2047 Miles driven remained below prior year, in particular, for higher income workers working remotely who generally take their cars to pro shops. \u2047 This has limited growth in certain professional sales channels and in key categories like brakes. \u2047 Geographically, all of our eight regions posted positive comps in the quarter, led by our southernmost regions, including both the Southeast and Southwest. \u2047 Meanwhile, our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions remained below our reported growth rate. \u2047 As previously discussed, large urban markets in these regions have been more impacted by COVID-19 with the most significant decline in miles driven. \u2047 The good news is that while there remains a gap between our highest and lowest performing regions that spread continues to narrow. \u2047 We're cautiously optimistic this will further narrow in Q1 based on improving trends and more favorable winter weather early in the year. \u2047 With respect to categories, DieHard is driving record battery sales and led our growth in Q4. \u2047 In addition, appearance chemicals remained strong, a trend that began with the stay at home orders last April. \u2047 Across our professional business, our team continues to leverage our industry-leading assortment of national brands, OE parts and own brands. \u2047 For pro customers, there is nothing more important than having the right part in the right place at the right time. \u2047 To enable this, we continued to strengthen our Dynamic Assortment tool, which is now live in all our corporate stores and more than 700 independent locations that have opted in. \u2047 This machine learning platform has enabled significant improvements in product availability, helping drive over 60 basis point improvement in Q4 close rates. \u2047 In addition, we continued to make enhancements to our online portal, MyAdvance. \u2047 The ease of access and wide array of resources available now includes features like virtual training, which has been essential during the pandemic. \u2047 The resources we provide through our Carquest and WorldPac technical institutes allow our pro customers, including all technicians within those shop to attend interactive virtual training. \u2047 Additionally, we continue to update our comprehensive catalog of technical service bulletins through our MotoLogic platform. \u2047 We believe pro customers are recognizing and appreciating our investments to improve parts quality, product availability, delivery speed and the digital experience, resulting in higher enterprise pro online sales and share of wallet. \u2047 These actions have also enabled growth of our Technet customer base with approximately 1,400 new Technets added in 2020. \u2047 Finally, we continued increasing our Carquest Independent locations in 2020, welcoming 50 new stores. \u2047 Our independents remain a valuable component of our overall strategy and our team remains focused on further expansion. \u2047 Moving on to DIY omnichannel, we gained share in every region and across most categories in both Q4 and for the full year based on the syndicated data available to us. \u2047 We believe our share gains are the result of our focus in four areas. \u2047 First, the launch of DieHard. \u2047 Second, building awareness in regard of Advance through differentiation. \u2047 Third, improving customer loyalty through Speed Perks. \u2047 And fourth, improving store execution. \u2047 Starting with DieHard, despite the challenges of the pandemic, our team successfully launched DieHard as planned and executed a marketing plan unlike anything we've ever done before at AAP. \u2047 Our DieHard is Back campaign, featuring Bruce Willis, let consumers know that the iconic DieHard brand was back and they can now buy DieHard at Advance and Carquest. \u2047 This campaign is already improving top of mind and unaided awareness for DieHard. \u2047 Our Speed Perks program is an important tool to drive customer loyalty. \u2047 Our team continues to invest in personalization for Speed Perks members, driving higher engagement, long-term loyalty and increased share of wallet. \u2047 In 2020, we grew our VIP members, those with an annual spend of $250 to $500 by nearly 15%. \u2047 And our Elite members, those with annual spend of more than $500 by more than 20%. \u2047 To wrap up the discussion on DIY omnichannel, we continue to see improvement from our initiatives, including our net promoter scores. \u2047 This gives us confidence that we're on the right track to sustained sales and share momentum in 2021. \u2047 Moving on to an update of our four pillars of margin expansion, I'll begin with sales and profit per store. \u2047 As a reminder, following three consecutive years of declining sales per store, we finished 2017 at approximately $1.5 million per store. \u2047 Over the last three years, we've been optimizing our footprint, including the closure of 273 underperforming stores. \u2047 Our sales per store have now grown for three consecutive years. \u2047 And we finished 2020 at nearly $1.7 million per store. \u2047 We're also executing a focused agenda to leverage payroll, while reducing shrink, returns and the factors to drive four wall profit per store improvement. \u2047 In addition, the ongoing focus on team members is enabling us to attract the very best parts people and to reduce turnover. \u2047 Our team members are a differentiator for Advance. \u2047 And four years ago, we made a commitment to dramatically improve retention. \u2047 Continued investment in our unique Fuel the Frontline program with more than 22,000 stock grants awarded since inception is creating an ownership culture. \u2047 In the current environment, with an increased competition for talent, we are reducing store turnover and enhancing our employment brand. \u2047 We now have three straight years of comp sales growth and the closure of underperforming stores behind us. \u2047 We're excited to announce that we plan to expand our store base and geographic footprint this year and expect to open 50 to 100 new stores. \u2047 Our second margin expansion pillar is supply chain. \u2047 While we paused our cross banner replenishment and warehouse management system initiatives early in 2020, our team found ways to innovate and make progress on these productivity opportunity later in the year. \u2047 The expansion of cross banner replenishment is on track with the timing we communicated in November. \u2047 As we finished the year with just over 40% of the originally planned stores completed, we are on track to complete the originally planned stores and DCs by the end of Q3 2021 and the full run rate savings will come beginning in Q4 2021. \u2047 In addition, the implementation of our new warehouse management system or WMS continued in Q4. \u2047 We converted our fourth DC by year end as planned and we're on track to complete our largest buildings this year. \u2047 We believe we can capture roughly 75% of the savings from this initiative in 2022. \u2047 Moving on to category management, the expansion of our own brand assortment is a key component. \u2047 This includes an increase of Carquest-branded assortment in engine management and undercar. \u2047 Carquest has an excellent reputation with installers and new products have been very well received by both pro customers and Carquest Independents. \u2047 In 2020, we also launched our strategic pricing initiative to enhance our capabilities, while incorporating customer decision journey insights into price and discount decision making. \u2047 Finally, our fourth pillar of margin expansion involves reducing and better leveraging SG&A. \u2047 The successful execution of our field restructure, back office consolidations and safety initiatives benefited SG&A in the quarter and will enable further improvement in margin expansion going forward. \u2047 As we called out in November, SG&A was elevated in Q4, primarily due to COVID-19-related expenses and other factors that Jeff will detail shortly. \u2047 To summarize, we're now in execution mode on our key growth and margin expansion initiatives. \u2047 Our mission is Passion for Customers Passion for Yes. \u2047 With the goal of serving them with care and speed, we've made many necessary changes at AAP in recent years. \u2047 But one thing that has not changed is the current technology, the passion and the commitment of our team members and independent partners. \u2047 Our actions have strengthened Advance, enabling us to compete more vigorously. \u2047 Finally, we're very excited to share our third sustainability and social responsibility report next month, and we'll be providing a strategic update of our long-term plans on April 20. \u2047 With that, I'll pass the call to Jeff to discuss our financial results in greater detail as well as our 2021 guidance. \u2047 I too would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to all our team members for the extraordinary focus and effort throughout 2020 despite the unprecedented times. \u2047 Our entire team adjusted, adapted and continued to execute our priorities. \u2047 In Q4, our net sales of $2.4 billion increased 12%. \u2047 Adjusted gross profit margin expanded 192 basis points to 45.9%. \u2047 driven primarily by inventory-related items, cost and price improvements as well as supply chain leverage. \u2047 As our primary focus throughout the year was on the health and safety of our team members and customers, we temporarily paused our physical inventory counts earlier this year. \u2047 When we resumed these in Q4, our actual shrink rates were far better than we had anticipated. \u2047 This resulted in a benefit in inventory-related costs due to a reduction in the reserve to reflect the positive result. \u2047 LIFO-related impacts were a tailwind this quarter versus prior year. \u2047 This will be the last quarter we included LIFO impacts in our adjusted financial results as we will begin reporting in Q1 2021 excluding any benefits or expenses from LIFO and our adjusted financial measures. \u2047 We believe this adjustment creates a more accurate picture of our operational results and is more in line with industry practices. \u2047 Our Q4 adjusted SG&A expense was $913.5 million. \u2047 On a rate basis, this represented 38.6% of net sales compared to 36.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 The single biggest driver of this increase was $19 million in COVID-related costs directly attributable to the unanticipated spike in case rates. \u2047 We also incurred higher Q4 medical claims as a result of lower claims during the prior quarters. \u2047 In addition, our short-term incentive compensation for both field and corporate team members was higher than prior year. \u2047 Separately, we invested behind the launch of The DieHard is Back campaign. \u2047 We also incurred lease termination costs related to the ongoing optimization of our real estate footprint. \u2047 We believe these expected investments in DieHard and lease optimization will result in top and bottom line improvements. \u2047 Despite higher SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income increased 14.6% in Q4 to $171.8 million. \u2047 On a rate basis, our adjusted OI margin expanded by 17 basis points. \u2047 Finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.87, up 14% from prior year despite a $0.22 impact in the quarter from COVID expenses. \u2047 For the full year, which includes an additional week versus 2019, we delivered record net sales of $10.1 billion, which increased 4.1%. \u2047 The 53rd, added approximately $158 million to sales. \u2047 Our adjusted gross profit increased 5% year-over-year and adjusted gross profit margin expanded 38 basis points. \u2047 Adjusted SG&A expense for full year 2020 increased 5.2% from 2019 results. \u2047 This was primarily the result of COVID-related expenses discussed earlier as well as the 53rd week. \u2047 We estimate the additional week resulted in a headwind of approximately 1.5% to our SG&A costs in the year. \u2047 Our adjusted operating income increased 4.1% to $827.3 million. \u2047 And our OI margins was 8.2%, flat compared to prior year. \u2047 Adjusting for the $60 million in COVID costs, our adjusted operating income margin expanded"], "gold_summary": ["compname says q4 same store sales rose 4.7%.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $1.87.  \u2047  q4 same
