{"article": ["We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Participants in today's call include our President and acting Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor; and our Executive Director and independent Board member, Chris Pappas. \u2047 We also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session. \u2047 Before I get into our results, I wanted to kick off the call with a few words on a critical area of focus for FirstEnergy. \u2047 Taking appropriate actions to address our recent challenges and fostering a strong culture of compliance, ethics and integrity, we are deeply committed to creating a culture in which compliance is endemic in second nature and where our leaders prioritize and encourage open and transparent communications with all of our stakeholders. \u2047 This focus is absolutely essential for our success as an organization. \u2047 Our commitment starts at the top and extends throughout the organization. \u2047 We are working to ensure that every leader is actively engaged in setting the proper tone and creating an environment where not only our words, but our actions align with our core values and behaviors. \u2047 We're building a world-class compliance function to underpin this effort, including bringing on Hyun Park as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer in January. \u2047 Hyun is the right person to step into this role at this time, and he will be instrumental in driving this cultural shift. \u2047 We will also be appointing a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who will manage a dedicated team of compliance professionals and enhance our efforts to improve our compliance function by shifting from a decentralized to a more centralized model. \u2047 In addition, we'll be designating compliance ambassadors throughout the company to act as boots on the ground, ensuring the entire organization understands the critical importance of compliance and what it means for each individual. \u2047 We are also making significant changes in our approach to political and legislative engagement and advocacy. \u2047 Our activity in this space will be much more limited than it has been in the past, with closer alignment to our strategic goals and with additional oversight and significantly more robust disclosure. \u2047 With this additional transparency, my goal is to make it crystal clear exactly what efforts we support. \u2047 These efforts, together with enhanced policies and procedures, will help to bring additional clarity around appropriate behaviors at FirstEnergy. \u2047 And through enhanced communications, training, and most importantly, our actions, we are dedicated to reemphasizing that every employee at every level has the responsibility to consistently act in accordance with our core values and behaviors and to speak up if they see inappropriate behavior anywhere in the organization. \u2047 At the same time, we're taking decisive actions to rebuild our reputation and brand and focus on the future. \u2047 This includes the decisions recently made with respect to Ohio that I'll talk about shortly. \u2047 And while we don't control the time line related to the DOJ and SEC, we will continue to cooperate fully with these government investigations and remain focused on the matters that we can control. \u2047 But be assured that both management and the Board will be relentless and take the steps needed to position our company for long-term success. \u2047 Now turning to earnings. \u2047 Today, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share. \u2047 On Tuesday, we announced several proactive steps we're taking to resolve a range of regulatory proceedings affecting our Ohio utilities. \u2047 These include our previously announced agreement with the Ohio Attorney General, along with the decision not to seek recovery of lost distribution revenues. \u2047 This resulted in a charge of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Absent this charge, our 2020 operating earnings would have been $2.54 per share. \u2047 Well above the midpoint of our most recent guidance range and reflective of our strong performance last year. \u2047 While this was a difficult decision, we are confident it was the right decision. \u2047 We believe resolving these matters in a comprehensive manner is a critical step to demonstrate our commitment to transparency and integrity in every aspect of our business, while taking steps toward removing uncertainty relating to our current Ohio regulatory matters. \u2047 And in the interest of providing additional transparency, today's investor materials will include more information about regulatory ROEs in each of the states we serve. \u2047 We remain excited about the significant investment opportunities that will continue to drive solid earnings and growth in the years ahead. \u2047 When we have further clarity in Ohio, and with the ongoing government investigations, we intend to resume providing a long-term growth rate that should be consistent with traditional utility growth rates and similar to what we have provided in the past. \u2047 For now, we are focusing on this year and we have introduced 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. \u2047 Because we have a lot of ground to cover today, including: our solid operational performance last year, even in the face of the pandemic; our strategy for 2021 and beyond, including our commitment to building shareholder value; and the work we're doing to position the company for the future. \u2047 Our fundamental performance continues to be excellent. \u2047 We continued making demonstrable progress on our strategic goals, and we had an exceptional year from a safety perspective. \u2047 Even with about half of our employees working from home and the others adopting new health and safety protocols, the FirstEnergy team has remained laser focused on providing safe and reliable service to our six million customers. \u2047 I am deeply proud of the team's resilience and commitment, especially in light of the turbulence that marked the year. \u2047 Our results in 2020 reflect our commitment to strong operations as well as the stability provided by our diverse footprint and our wires-focused platform. \u2047 Last year, we also successfully executed our plan to invest $3 billion in our distribution and transmission systems as we continued our reliability in grid mod program to benefit customers. \u2047 We believe our robust long-term organic growth opportunities are well aligned with the focus on electrification and the critical role the grid plays in supporting the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. \u2047 These opportunities and our goals that support them are included in our strategic plan, published last month and available on our website. \u2047 I hope you have taken some time to review it. \u2047 This updated plan addresses our unwavering commitment to transparency and accountability and identifies old goals for key areas of our business. \u2047 These goals are aligned with our core values and behaviors, our regulatory strategy and our commitments to our customers, communities and investors as well as environmental stewardship. \u2047 Among these objectives outlined in the plan is our pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. \u2047 This ambitious goal reflects our transformation to a regulated electric utility and our responsibility to help create a sustainable energy future. \u2047 The strategic plan also addresses our continued commitment to build a more diverse and inclusive workplace. \u2047 We've had a D&I-focused KPI for three years now and we are taking even more aggressive steps to make progress in this area. \u2047 We're excited to pursue a 30% increase in our number of racially and ethnically underrepresented employees by 2025, both overall and at the supervisor and above level. \u2047 We believe this will help accelerate our transformation into an innovative, diverse and sustainable company and drive an important shift in our corporate culture. \u2047 We recently completed our fourth companywide survey of all employees. \u2047 Overall, I'm proud to say we scored relatively well on many fronts, but we certainly have more work to do. \u2047 One area identified for improvement is listening and valuing the opinions of our employees. \u2047 We want employees to feel empowered to voice their opinion on important issues and my team, with guidance and support from the Board of Directors, is addressing this head-on. \u2047 We view this work as central to strengthening our compliance program and a culture of ethics, integrity and accountability. \u2047 I'd like to explain my approach to driving this change, and perhaps we could use the company's safety culture as an analogy. \u2047 Several years ago, we had concerns that our safety culture was trending in the wrong direction. \u2047 Management led a significant effort with our employees to put in place new programs and training. \u2047 And to consistently demonstrate that safety is and will always be an unwavering core value. \u2047 These efforts ultimately instituted a cultural shift in how we all understood the critical importance of safety. \u2047 We want that very same cultural shift to occur as it relates to compliance and ethics. \u2047 As we look ahead, I feel confident in our path forward. \u2047 We have a strong foundation. \u2047 Our fundamentals are solid, and our strategies are proven. \u2047 And we are building on that with a relentless focus on making FirstEnergy a better company as we work to rebuild trust, work to achieve financial results and deliver for our customers and investors. \u2047 We recognize that changes won't happen overnight. \u2047 They happen over time, just like the evolution in our safety culture I spoke about earlier. \u2047 I'm confident we will emerge a stronger, better FirstEnergy. \u2047 First, I'd like to reiterate the Board's strong support of Steve and recognize the hard work he and the rest of the team are doing. \u2047 We commend their willingness to learn from the past and their absolute commitment to take this company forward on a new path, all while executing the company's strategy and keeping operations and financial results on solid footing. \u2047 The Board and management team are focused on a critical objective: to move forward from the past actions of certain former executives; and to take the steps necessary to improve the tone at the top, culture of ethics and integrity and the way we do business. \u2047 Steve talked about a lot of the important work that is being driven by the new management team. \u2047 Likewise, the Board is committed to strengthening every part of FirstEnergy's culture and taking the necessary steps to reestablish credibility. \u2047 Together, we have made much progress on the issues that confronted the company several months ago. \u2047 And at the same time, we recognize there is more work to do. \u2047 I'd like to recap some of the steps that the Board has been actively engaged in to drive improvements in our culture of compliance. \u2047 First, the Board promptly put in place an independent committee with external counsel to oversee the internal investigation and to monitor the status of the various regulatory and legal matters facing the company. \u2047 The independent committee, which currently is made up of the entire board, meets frequently and regularly. \u2047 The Board acted as swiftly in the removal of five executives, named Steve Strah as acting CEO, established an Executive Director role and expanded the role of the Board's share, all to assist management and the Board with the dynamics we faced in the first months of the investigation. \u2047 The Board unequivocally endorsed the principle of full cooperation with both the DOJ and the SEC on the matters related to the investigation. \u2047 And through our own internal investigation, led by independent counsel, has supported intensive analysis. \u2047 The Board established a compliance oversight subcommittee of the Audit Committee with independent counsel and leading compliance advisors to analyze and improve the compliance policy and culture at FirstEnergy. \u2047 Steve mentioned some initial output from this work earlier. \u2047 In addition, the Board established a number of working groups to oversee and support various work streams, including communications, recruiting and financial flexibility. \u2047 And to that point, management has initiated a project called FirstEnergy Forward, a transformational effort to change the way the company does business. \u2047 The objective of this project is to transform the company for the future, but it will also provide near-term financial flexibility. \u2047 Jon will discuss this later on the call. \u2047 We know there is particular interest in the status of the internal investigation. \u2047 Hopefully, my earlier comments give you a sense of the intensity and the magnitude of the work that has occurred within the company and with the benefit of extensive external independent support. \u2047 Our internal investigation continues to be thorough and robust. \u2047 And includes assistance from external law firms who are supported by several other consultants. \u2047 The ongoing investigation has not resulted in any new material items not previously disclosed. \u2047 In the course of the internal investigation, we did identify certain transactions, which, in some instances, extended back 10 years or more, including vendor services that were either improperly classified, misallocated to certain of utility or transmission companies or lacked proper supporting documentation. \u2047 These transactions result in amounts collected from customers that were immaterial to FirstEnergy, and our utility and transmission companies will be working with the appropriate regulatory agencies to address these amounts. \u2047 Our internal investigation will also continue to address any due developments in connection with the ongoing DOJ and SEC investigations. \u2047 More importantly, we are increasing our focus on another critical aspect of our work, moving FirstEnergy forward. \u2047 The fresh perspective of Hyun Park and a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer will be invaluable to creating an environment where the entire team is committed to embracing the right behaviors and embedding a strong culture of compliance. \u2047 He will also join the executive team on a transitional basis as Executive Director and act in advisory capacity to support efforts to achieve the company's priorities: restore its reputation and strengthen its overall governance and compliance functions. \u2047 John is a 40-year industry executive with extensive energy experience in navigating complex challenges and driving strong corporate governance. \u2047 Bringing John into this full-time role means that I will step back from the Executive Director position I've held since October and return to my regular duties as an independent Board member by April 1. \u2047 And importantly, we will continue to fully support the management team as it transitions FirstEnergy to the future as a more resilient company. \u2047 Despite the challenges the company has faced, FirstEnergy's operating fundamentals are strong, and we have a great platform of assets. \u2047 Together, we have put in place a robust plan to move forward and to position FirstEnergy as an industry leader. \u2047 One, we know it can be and one that will deliver excellent value to its customers and shareholders. \u2047 We look forward to working together alongside with management in this effort. \u2047 Today, I will review our financial results and expectations and provide an update on several other financial matters. \u2047 Our operating results include the charge at our Ohio utilities that Steve mentioned earlier. \u2047 Absent this charge, our results reflect continued rate base growth related to our transmission and distribution investment programs, a favorable mix of customer usage reflecting the impact of our residential customers staying at home and higher expenses mostly associated with the pandemic. \u2047 Additional fourth quarter data is available in the supporting materials on our website. \u2047 As Steve mentioned, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share, which compared to 2019 GAAP results of $1.70 per share and operating earnings of $2.55 per share. \u2047 In our distribution business, in addition to the $0.15 charge at our Ohio utilities, results for 2020 as compared to 2019 reflect the absence of Rider DMR in Ohio, which was in place for the first half of 2019 and higher operating costs. \u2047 These were partially offset by higher revenues from increased residential usage as well as earnings from our distribution enhancement programs. \u2047 Although total weather-adjusted sales decreased 2% in 2020, normal usage from our residential customers increased 5% for the year, which from an"], "gold_summary": ["affirmed its plan to issue up to
