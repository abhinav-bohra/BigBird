{"article": ["Speaking on the call will be Ocwen's chief executive officer, Glen Messina; and chief financial officer, June Campbell. \u2047 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful supplement to analysis of our financial condition and an alternate way to view certain aspects of our business that is instructive. \u2047 Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for the company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. \u2047 These statements are based on currently available information and reflect our current estimates and assessments. \u2047 The company has not finished its fourth-quarter financial closing procedures. \u2047 There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our current estimates and assessments, including as a result of fourth-quarter financial closing procedures and any such differences could be material. \u2047 Let's get started today on Slide 3. \u2047 We're really energized by the great progress we've made across the company. \u2047 We've executed an incredible business transformation. \u2047 We're a better balanced and more diversified mortgage originator and servicer. \u2047 We're stronger, more efficient, and better aligned with future market opportunities. \u2047 We've concluded our strategic review and are excited to announce an expansion of our strategic alliance with Oaktree Capital with their investment in OFC Holdco notes. \u2047 We believe our alliance with Oaktree can enable a level of growth and earnings per share accretion, and potential value creation that we cannot achieve on a stand-alone basis, as well as, support the refinancing of our corporate debt. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we continued to improve profitability. \u2047 We delivered record growth in originations and we continued to reshape and diversify our servicing portfolio. \u2047 As we look ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on potential future growth opportunities in multiple market segments and we're focused on executing five straightforward operating objectives to drive improved value for shareholders. \u2047 Let's jump to Slide 6 to discuss the outcome of our strategic review process. \u2047 Our expanded strategic alliance with Oaktree marks the conclusion to our strategic review process that we announced in May 2020. \u2047 The objective of our strategic review was to maximize long-term value for Ocwen's shareholders. \u2047 Our review of alternatives which was overseen by our board and with the support of Barclays and Credit Suisse was fulsome and robust. \u2047 Our outreach was aided by our public announcement of the strategic review process which also resulted in inbound increase by parties not included in our initial outreach. \u2047 Now we had discussions with numerous parties and all options were considered. \u2047 And at the end of the day, there were really no actionable change of control or merger opportunities that emerged from these discussions. \u2047 In the absence of a change of control transaction, we believe we need to accelerate our originations and servicing growth, and address the upcoming corporate debt maturities to maximize our value as a stand-alone company. \u2047 We concluded through our strategic review that our ability to increase the leverage of the total company using the assets of the operating company was limited by a number of factors, including proposed regulatory requirements that may increase capital and liquidity requirements for nonbank mortgage companies. \u2047 So to address our growth and refinancing objectives with these constraints, we focused our structured financing solutions that would provide incremental capital to accelerate our growth and position the company to successfully refinance our upcoming corporate debt maturities without encumbering the assets necessarily of PHH, our operating company. \u2047 We're excited to announce that we've executed definitive agreements with Oaktree for $250 million in incremental capital through Holdco notes issued by Ocwen Financial Corporation. \u2047 This is our holding company and this incremental capital is in addition to our joint venture with Oaktree MAV. \u2047 When combined with MAV, we expect the over $460 million in capital provided by Oaktree can enable us to potentially increase our earnings per share by 65% or more once the proceeds are fully invested. \u2047 We believe the Holdco notes also support our corporate debt refinancing on more favorable terms while increasing capacity for secured financing and share repurchases. \u2047 Now for these reasons, the board found the Oaktree offer to be the most compelling opportunity to enable a level of growth, earnings per share accretion, and potential long-term value creation that we could not achieve on a stand-alone basis. \u2047 We believe the Oaktree investment enhances our ability to compete and prosper, as well as, demonstrates their confidence in and commitment to Ocwen's long-term success. \u2047 Yes, starting with the Holdco notes. \u2047 These are structured with the collateral package limited to a second lien on the assets of OFC, the holding company. \u2047 There is no lien on the PHH assets or guarantees from PHH. \u2047 This is a substantially reduced collateral coverage and more deeply subordinated position in our capital structure versus our existing high-yield notes. \u2047 The limited collateral package and deep subordination enables us to treat the proceeds from the Holdco notes that gets contributed to PHH, our operating company, as equity. \u2047 And we expect this will increase our ability to leverage the assets of PHH with first lien debt and secured financing. \u2047 You know this deeply subordinated position in our capital structure relating to the Holdco notes does translate into pricing that's close to equity. \u2047 The Oaktree notes have a face value of $285 million with a $35 million original issue discount for net proceeds of $250 million. \u2047 The coupon is 12%, plus about 2% for the effective annual cost of the OID. \u2047 In addition, Oaktree will receive warrants for 12% of the fully diluted shares of Ocwen. \u2047 In terms of use of proceeds, we intend to use $100 million of the proceeds to pay down and support the refinancing of our existing corporate debt in a concurrent refinancing transaction. \u2047 We expect less restrictive covenants, eliminating amortization, and relative to existing corporate debt, extending the maturity with an expected tenure of six years on the Holdco notes. \u2047 Concurrent with the refinancing, we'll pay off our existing corporate debt per their respective terms. \u2047 The remaining $150 million in proceeds from the Holdco notes will be used to support our on book growth objectives through MSR purchases and funding a portion of the MAV investment. \u2047 We do expect the incremental capital in the operating company will allow us to improve the terms of our existing MSR financing which can create up to about $75 million in additional capital from our existing MSRs. \u2047 The proceeds from Oaktree will come in two tranches. \u2047 The first tranche is $175 million and that will come in concurrently with the closing of the corporate debt refinancing. \u2047 The remaining $75 million will come in concurrent with the closing of MAV. \u2047 Moving on to MAV. \u2047 As we announced in December, we formed a partnership joint venture with Oaktree Capital to launch an MSR asset vehicle. \u2047 This vehicle will purchase MSRs. \u2047 Oaktree will own 85% and Ocwen will own 15%. \u2047 You know, MAV expects to leverage up to $250 million in capital that will be contributed by Oaktree and Ocwen, respectively, based on our relative shares to purchase MSRs and this will be leveraged up roughly one for one with secured MSR financing. \u2047 So that gives us the capacity for up to about $60 billion in MSR UPB. \u2047 Now PHH will be the sole provider of originations, subservicing, and recaptured administrative services to MAV. \u2047 And Ocwen will also earn MSR investment returns on its capital contribution and from profit sharing on returns in MAV above 12%. \u2047 Now MAV is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to GSE and regulatory approvals. \u2047 In terms of benefits, MAV supports our servicing and subservicing growth objectives on a capital-efficient basis and will help generate increased cost efficiency through increased origination and servicing scale. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 8. \u2047 In terms of the financial impact of the Oaktree investment in Ocwen, we estimate that a -- on a combined basis, the Holdco notes and MAV can contribute up to $78 million in annualized pre-tax income from full deployment of the capital provided by these two structures. \u2047 We estimate full deployment of the proceeds can generate roughly $5 per share in incremental earnings on a fully diluted basis. \u2047 This translates to over a 65% increase above our potential baseline earnings per share range which assumes an after-tax ROE range of roughly 10% to 15% on about $414 million of equity. \u2047 Using a PE multiple range of some of our peers of roughly 4 times to 6 times forward earnings, the potential incremental value creation is roughly $20 to $30 per share. \u2047 This is a 7 times to 10 times multiple of the potential book value per share dilution, assuming the warrants are fully issued and the corresponding increase to our equity from the proceeds related to issuing the warrants. \u2047 The incremental investment capital will allow us to further expand our originations activities and expand our participation in the bulk purchase market. \u2047 We expect to source roughly up to $200 billion in incremental total volume over the next couple of years. \u2047 And again, it's estimated to source up to $200 billion in incremental volume over the next two years. \u2047 The total growth in volume will allow us to grow our total subservicing portfolio to roughly $300 billion by the end of 2022, assuming the NRZ subservicing contract does not renew. \u2047 So again, strong growth in the servicing portfolio resulting from the originations. \u2047 We believe it's a great time to invest in MSRs. \u2047 Pretax cash IRRs in our MSRs generated in December were about 12% before MSR financing, that translates to roughly 18% after MSR secured financing. \u2047 Now in addition, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate M&A transactions to expand our originations and servicing capabilities which might provide enhanced returns versus MSR investments. \u2047 These estimates are based on the judgment of management and based on our current assumptions which may be subject to change based on market and industry conditions, among other things. \u2047 Look, the bottom line here is, we're really excited about our alliance with Oaktree and the opportunity it provides to enable a level of growth and earnings per share accretion and potential value creation that we could not achieve on a stand-alone basis. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 9, maybe a little bit about the fourth quarter. \u2047 So look, during 2020, we demonstrated exponential total volume growth, total cost improvement and built a scalable and efficient platform to support our future growth. \u2047 Adjusted pre-tax profitability was up roughly 15% in the fourth quarter over the third quarter despite declining origination margins. \u2047 Annualized adjusted pre-tax profitability has improved over $380 million over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined. \u2047 Our multichannel origination platform continued to deliver really strong results. \u2047 Flow origination volume in the fourth quarter was up 49% over the third quarter and up over 7 times as compared to 2019. \u2047 So again, just really great performance by the originations team. \u2047 And as we talked about earlier, we're focused on accelerating our growth trajectory in 2021. \u2047 Yeah, we are focused on driving efficiency in our operating expenses. \u2047 And as a result of that efficiency and our continuous cost improvement, operating expenses are down 44% over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined. \u2047 That's over a $400 million cost reduction. \u2047 So again, just great performance by the team in really rethinking and reimagining our business infrastructure. \u2047 You know, we're disappointed that settlement discussions with the CFPB did not resolve this matter and especially since we've resolved all state regulatory actions filed against Ocwen in 2017. \u2047 We engaged with the bureau in good faith throughout the course of mediation and numerous related discussions and took all actions in an attempt to reach a fair and reasonable resolution. \u2047 We increased our legal and regulatory accrual related to the CFPB matter by $13 million in the fourth quarter, resulting from our efforts to resolve the matter in mediation. \u2047 We remain steadfast in our belief that the CFPB's claims regarding Ocwen's past servicing practice are unsubstantiated and the bureau settlement demands do not reflect the merits of this case. \u2047 While we remain committed to attempting to resolve the matter prior to trial, our pending motion for summary judgment which was filed on June 5th, 2020, supports our position on this matter, and we expect to continually -- continue to vigorously defend ourselves going forward. \u2047 Look, it was a great quarter, the fourth quarter, a great year in 2020, and I could not be proud of the team of what they accomplished. \u2047 Yeah, moving to Slide 10. \u2047 Maybe a little bit about the originations platform. \u2047 We delivered a record total volume of $30 billion in the fourth quarter. \u2047 It translates to roughly an annualized run rate of about $60 billion from our flow channels and about $60 billion annualized from bulk. \u2047 Total volume for 2020 was $59 billion versus $26 billion last year, so we've doubled total volume. \u2047 Full-year flow and co-issue originations were up 8 times over last year. \u2047 Full-year bulk and subservicing adds were up over 48% as compared to last year. \u2047 Our correspondent and flow seller base increased about threefold since the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 You know, all of our channels delivered strong double-digit growth quarter over quarter. \u2047 As I mentioned before, cash yields and MSRs continued to be very strong, and our portfolio replenishment was exceptional. \u2047 In addition, in the fourth quarter, we were awarded multiple subservicing contracts with projected volume of $16 billion to $24 billion that we expect will board in the first and second quarter. \u2047 Now margins as well continued to contract in the fourth quarter. \u2047 We had expected that. \u2047 The average margins fell to about 56 basis points versus our expectation of 77 basis points for Q4. \u2047 This is really solely due to higher-than-expected third party volume. \u2047 Margin compression by each channel was actually slightly less than expected. \u2047 Again, here, great performance by our originations and capital markets teams and I believe we've got more room to grow. \u2047 We'll talk about that in a minute. \u2047 Turning to Slide 11. \u2047 Our servicing platform continued to deliver very strong performance in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our servicing leadership team is doing a great job of driving continued improvement in efficiency and effectiveness and helping customers navigate through the crisis. \u2047 Our call center continued to outperform the MBA reported industry averages. \u2047 Our key claims metrics also continued to perform with nearly 100% effectiveness. \u2047 We continued to invest in technology to lower unit costs, improve performance for investors and enhance the customer experience. \u2047 Despite almost all of our people working remotely, we've continued our unparalleled track record"], "gold_summary": ["ocwen financial - executed agreement with special purpose entities owned by funds and accounts
