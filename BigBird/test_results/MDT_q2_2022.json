{"article": ["Today's discussion is being broadcast on our website. \u2047 Participating in today's call are Bob Wetherbee, Board Chair President and CEO; and Don Newman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Bob and Don will focus on our third quarter highlights and key messages, but may refer to certain slides within their remarks. \u2047 These slides are available on our website. \u2047 They provide additional color and details on our results and outlook. \u2047 It feels great to report that we returned to profitability in the third quarter, three months ahead of our expectations. \u2047 This was no small achievement, as we overcame pandemic-induced disruptions, a three-plus month labor strike and the challenges inherent in significant business transformation. \u2047 Our success is due in equal parts to accelerated rates of recovery in our diverse end markets, our significant business restructuring and transformation efforts and the perseverance of the ATI team. \u2047 Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.05. \u2047 EPS improve to $0.35 per share when you factor in the net positive impacts from settling our recent labor strike, including the benefits from our new collective bargaining agreement, and the lingering strike-related costs as well as the gain from the Flowform Products divestiture. \u2047 I'm proud of what our team has accomplished, overcoming the challenges of the past two years. \u2047 We're winning on the top line through new business and by capturing share gains. \u2047 We're winning on the bottom line by tightly managing costs and solidifying our financial foundation. \u2047 We've begun to pivot to growth. \u2047 We're excited about what we can achieve as the commercial aerospace recovery accelerates and our business operates at high utilization levels. \u2047 Before I dig into our performance and outlook by end market, I'll provide a progress update on a few of our strategic initiatives. \u2047 First, we took another step in our ongoing business transformation. \u2047 We sold our Flowform business for $55 million, resulting in a gain on sale of nearly $14 million. \u2047 While this business primarily serves the defense market, it had little connection to the broader ATI. \u2047 There were a few material synergies, and its long-term success was linked to specific program volumes rather than our material science. \u2047 The new owner will be better placed to invest for its future. \u2047 Second, we've built upon our firm financial foundation by taking steps to reduce earnings volatility and cash flow variability and increase financial flexibility. \u2047 I don't want to steal a lot of Don's highlights here, so I'll limit my comments. \u2047 We successfully tapped the favorable debt markets to our advantage. \u2047 We significantly extended our debt maturities by redeeming notes due in 2023. \u2047 At the same time, we added new notes due in 2029 and 2031. \u2047 A portion of these proceeds were used to support a voluntary pension contribution. \u2047 As a result of these third quarter actions, annual interest expense will decrease by about $6 million and pension funding levels improve. \u2047 Third, as a visible next step in our continuing journey to become one ATI, we promoted Kim Fields to serve as Chief Operating Officer effective January 2022. \u2047 This officially recognizes the role she's been serving in since December 2020, leading both business segments. \u2047 Kim's doing a great job aligning the businesses, accelerating execution and streamlining material flows. \u2047 As markets recover and asset utilization increases, we're better positioned to expand margins and improve cash generation under her leadership. \u2047 Lastly, we continue to make progress on strategically transforming our Specialty Rolled Products business, taking deliberate actions to create a competitive cost structure. \u2047 This began last December when we announced our plans to exit low-margin standard stainless sheet products. \u2047 It includes closing five facilities and concurrently streamlining and upgrading our high-value material flow paths. \u2047 Those efforts are largely on track. \u2047 I'll have more on that in a moment. \u2047 In July, we reached agreement with Specialty Rolled Products union representative employees, ending their 3.5-month strike. \u2047 Together, we signed a contract that rewards our employees for their important contributions to ATI's overall success. \u2047 The SRP business is now positioned to be successful in the long term. \u2047 I'm pleased to say that by the end of September, we've ramped SRP's production rates back to pre-strike levels, with one exception that we're working hard to address. \u2047 The SRP team did an outstanding job safely getting back on track, accelerating production to meet strong customer demand. \u2047 You might wonder where we stand on our decision to exit standard stainless sheet products given the current strong market demand. \u2047 History reminds us, this is a temporary upswing in a highly cyclical business with chronically low margins and high fixed costs. \u2047 Our commitment to exit hasn't wavered, but our time line has extended by three to five months due to the strike-related impacts. \u2047 First, the strike caused us to slow aerospace qualification activities across SRP operations. \u2047 It also created significant product backlog destined for strategic customers. \u2047 As a result, at facilities slated for closure, we'll extend a few select operations into the second quarter of 2022. \u2047 I would have preferred to stay on our original time line. \u2047 We're committed to better position our customers for the accelerating economic recovery and take near-term advantage where current market conditions offer a valuable upside. \u2047 The savings capture will be slowed by a quarter or two. \u2047 So let me be clear, the overall favorable economics attached to our transformation over the long run remain in place. \u2047 Turning to our third quarter performance and outlook by market. \u2047 We're seeing clear evidence of recovery. \u2047 Momentum is building as volumes return to pre-pandemic demand levels. \u2047 Let's start with our largest end market, commercial aerospace. \u2047 Expansion continues unevenly across our product portfolio. \u2047 In the jet engine market, forgings demand grew for the fourth quarter in a row. \u2047 This expansion was driven by demand for narrowbody engines, coupled with our 2021 market share gains. \u2047 Our Q3 results included initial LEAP-1B volume increases to support the expected 737 MAX production ramp. \u2047 In contrast to forgings, our sequential jet engine Specialty Materials sales declined somewhat. \u2047 While it appears that our customers' jet engine material inventories are nearing a low point, it's clear that pockets of inventory exist. \u2047 We also believe there's widespread customer desire to tightly manage year-end inventory levels. \u2047 We predict these inventory stockpiles will be fully depleted soon, as OEM production rate increases materialize. \u2047 We expect customer hesitancy to wane over the next few quarters and order patterns to reflect underlying demand once again. \u2047 Lastly, on Commercial Aerospace. \u2047 Our airframe business expanded sequentially for two reasons: first, post-strike recovery efforts in our SRP business; and second, the increasing orders associated with our new European OEM long-term agreement. \u2047 Year-over-year airframe sales declined. \u2047 We expect this market to continue at low levels in Q4 and into 2022 as international travel rates recover more slowly and 787 deliveries remain on hold. \u2047 Despite the mixed third quarter aerospace performance, there's good news on the horizon. \u2047 As the COVID Delta variant impact slows and international travel restrictions ease, customers are once again returning to the skies. \u2047 This market is already displaying strong recovery trends in the form of increased domestic passenger travel, higher global cargo volumes and accelerated fleet retirements. \u2047 Moving to the defense market. \u2047 Revenue declined sequentially, largely due to customer shipment timing and the sale of our Flowform business. \u2047 Year-over-year growth was strong. \u2047 What's driving growth in the near term? \u2047 Titanium armor for land-based vehicle programs in the U.S. and the U.K., military jet engine sales and the expansion of new helicopter programs. \u2047 Longer term, we remain highly confident in ATI defense growth. \u2047 Our confidence stems from a wide range of new programs and opportunities that can benefit from our advanced materials development and production capabilities. \u2047 Turning to the energy markets. \u2047 We saw significant growth sequentially and year-over-year in both business segments. \u2047 This occurred in oil and gas as well as specialty energy. \u2047 In our Advanced Alloys & Solutions segment, we produced and shipped most of a large nickel alloy project destined for offshore waters in South America. \u2047 In our High Performance Materials & Components segment, strong demand continued for our nickel products used in land-based gas turbine production in Asia. \u2047 The near-term outlook for our energy markets is solid. \u2047 Global GDP growth and higher travel rates will increase energy demand clearly. \u2047 Sustainability trends will drive exploration and production of more environmentally friendly energy generation and transmission technologies. \u2047 All of these are best served with our unique high-performance materials. \u2047 Let's wrap up our market discussion with our critical applications used in medical and electronics. \u2047 In medical, sales grew sequentially and year-over-year. \u2047 Increased demand for biomedical implant materials was driven by low post-pandemic customer inventory levels and increased elective surgery volumes. \u2047 In Q4, we expect these trends to continue and likely expand to include MRI-related materials. \u2047 Electronic sales were lower compared to the record-setting levels of the previous quarter and last year, but still very strong. \u2047 The strong demand for other key end markets required production allocations within our China Precision Rolled Strip facility, constraining, within the quarter, available capacity for electronics products. \u2047 We also had a planned Q3 maintenance outage at our Oregon facility. \u2047 Underlying customer demand for electronics remains strong and should continue. \u2047 I'll wrap up my opening comments by saying I'm confidently bullish on ATI's future. \u2047 Our end markets are recovering. \u2047 We're growing our market share. \u2047 We've aggressively locked in cost-structure improvements. \u2047 We have significant growth opportunities on the horizon. \u2047 We've put ourselves in a position to accelerate growth and expand margins. \u2047 We're executing to win. \u2047 It's an exciting time for ATI. \u2047 I'm proud to lead this team as we achieve our goal of becoming a premier supplier of aerospace and defense materials. \u2047 Bob already gave you my opening line. \u2047 ATI returned to profitability in the third quarter, three months ahead of our expectations. \u2047 A lot of hard work went into rightsizing the business and putting us on this path for growth. \u2047 We'll celebrate for a moment, but in reality, we've already shifted our focus to capitalizing on this momentum, further expanding our business and generating shareholder value. \u2047 Now for the details. \u2047 Overall, Q3 revenue increased to $726 million, up 18% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. \u2047 Q3-adjusted EBITDA grew to $80 million, up 49% sequentially and up 381% year-over-year. \u2047 Q3 performance suggests a revenue run rate approaching $3 billion and an adjusted EBITDA run rate of $320 million. \u2047 On a reported basis, ATI earned $0.35 per share in the third quarter. \u2047 We earned $0.05 per share in the quarter after adjusting for a net $43 million of special items. \u2047 These included gains for post-retirement medical benefits, resulting from the new SRP collective bargaining agreement and from Flowform products divestiture. \u2047 Strike-related costs were also excluded. \u2047 To better understand our results, I'll provide some color around each segment's performance. \u2047 Starting with AA&S, sales grew by 35% sequentially and EBITDA by nearly 60% versus the prior quarter. \u2047 Within the segment, the SRP team did an outstanding job accelerating post-strike production levels. \u2047 This was against a backdrop of strong customer demand and elevated pricing opportunities. \u2047 Their efforts produced tangible results, bringing us back to first quarter 2021 production rates by the end of September, as we had predicted. \u2047 Our Precision Rolled Strip business in China once again had record sales and earnings due to continued strong demand across a variety of end markets. \u2047 AA&S segment Q3 performance also compared favorably to Q3 2020. \u2047 Revenue increased $49 million, and EBITDA increased $46 million. \u2047 This impressive earnings growth was powered by increased market demand, higher HRPF toll conversion volumes, streamlined cost structures and metal price tailwinds. \u2047 HPMC Q3 sales and earnings were in line with the second quarter and much improved from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Sequential forgings growth from commercial and military jet engine sales was offset by a quarter-over-quarter decline in Specialty Materials jet engine revenues and the impact of selling our Flowform business in Q3. \u2047 Earnings and margins were consistent sequentially. \u2047 We offset a weaker product mix, driven by increased energy market sales with operational cost improvements. \u2047 HPMC sales were higher year-over-year in every major market, led by commercial aerospace. \u2047 Earnings and margins expanded significantly in Q3 versus the same quarter in 2020. \u2047 This is a result of our decisive 2020 cost-cutting actions, jet engine share gains and contractual margin improvements. \u2047 Let's move to the balance sheet. \u2047 Late in the third quarter, we issued two debt tranches totaling $675 million. \u2047 $325 million of the notes are due in 2029 and bear interest at 4.875%. \u2047 $350 million of the notes are due in 2031 and bear interest at 5.125%. \u2047 Proceeds from these notes were largely used to redeem $500 million of notes due in 2023, bearing a 7.875% interest rate. \u2047 The financing brings several benefits, including $6 million in annual cash interest savings, significantly lower interest rates and a much improved debt maturity schedule. \u2047 Excess proceeds from the financing were largely used to support a $50 million voluntary pension contribution in the quarter. \u2047 I will come back to our pension glide path in a moment. \u2047 After redeeming the 2023 notes in mid-October, we had more than $800 million of liquidity, including approximately $440 million of cash on hand. \u2047 Third quarter managed working capital levels improved sequentially, but remained above our target. \u2047 This was largely due to SRP strike recovery efforts. \u2047 Q3 SRP sales were back-end loaded, increasing quarter-end accounts receivable. \u2047 We also ramped production in the quarter, but we're unable to fully eliminate inventory backlogs before quarter end. \u2047 We expect significant reductions in managed working capital levels, well below 40% of revenue across the company in Q4. \u2047 Our $50 million voluntary contribution is the latest action in our plan to improve pension funding levels and reduce related expenses and contributions over time. \u2047 In the third quarter, we completed our fifth pension annuitization effort. \u2047 This lowers overall participation by nearly 1,000 people and shifts approximately $70 million of assets and liabilities to a third party. \u2047 We have seen favorable asset returns and planned discount rate movements so far in 2021. \u2047 "],
