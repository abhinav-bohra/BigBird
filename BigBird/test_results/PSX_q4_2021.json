{"article": ["We do want to send out our very best wishes that you and your families are well. \u2047 We provide guidance for both adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization or OIBDA and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA to highlight the contributions of UScellular's wireless partnerships. \u2047 In terms of our upcoming IR schedule, Slide 3, we will be virtually attending the Raymond James SMID Cap Company Showcase virtually on November 12th and 13th, and we are attending the UBS Global TMT Conference virtually on December 8th and our open-door policy is now more of an open phone or open video policy, so please reach out to us if we can arrange something. \u2047 Before turning the call over, I do want to remind everyone that due to the FCC's Anti-Collusion Rules related to the RDOF Auction and Auction 107, we will not be responding to any questions related to FCC Auctions. \u2047 I'm going to make some brief comments about the balance sheet and our liquidity position. \u2047 But before doing so, I'd like to recognize the impressive operational and financial results of both businesses during the quarter. \u2047 As we've discussed on past calls, maintaining financial flexibility is one of the pillars of our corporate strategy. \u2047 Over the years, we have worked to retain relatively low leverage levels, long-dated debt maturities, sufficient undrawn revolving credit facilities and significant cash balances, while at the same time making sure that we have the financial resources we need to fund our businesses. \u2047 As you can see on Slide 4, on September 30 TDS continued to have a strong financial position including $2.2 billion in immediately available funding sources consisting of cash and cash equivalents, available credit facilities, undrawn term loans and undrawn portions of our EIP securitization facility. \u2047 In the quarter, UScellular took advantage of favorable market conditions and issued $500 million of 6.25% retail senior notes due in 2069. \u2047 It is very typical for us to opportunistically tap the market for funding when conditions are favorable, as they certainly were in August. \u2047 As highlighted on the slide we have a number of potential funding sources. \u2047 In this instance, given market conditions, we judge that the retail debt market was relatively favorable taking into account all factors including term, call ability, ease of execution, lack of impact on the business operations, lack of meaningful covenants and of course, the all-in cost of financing relative to our other potential alternatives. \u2047 In October, UScellular upsized its EIP securitization agreement from $200 million to $300 million. \u2047 While shorter in term than some of our other financings, this is our lowest cost financing facility and we have a solid pool of receivables against which we can raise funds. \u2047 In sum, we are in a very strong position to invest in the growth opportunities identified by both of our businesses. \u2047 It's kind of hard to believe but I've been on the job for four months already and I'm really looking forward to providing all of you with a brief update on the progress we've made over that time. \u2047 But before we pass by this page, Page 5, I just want to point out the new logo that we introduced in September and this logo is just another aspect of our program to elevate and evolve the UScellular brand. \u2047 This provides I think a much more modern look, reflects the rapidly evolving technologies in the services we provide to our customers. \u2047 You would expect to see further changes to this brand in the marketplace in the coming quarters but this logo is the first step. \u2047 Let's turn to Page 6 and talk a little bit about the quarter. \u2047 So we reported a really impressive quarter and I'm really proud of how the team executed. \u2047 We had strong subscriber and financial results and I think that's evidence of just how essential our industry is. \u2047 The value the customers ascribed to the services we provide but it's also credit to the talent and resiliency of the organization. \u2047 We saw strong sales of connected devices and that coupled with low churn helped us grow our base. \u2047 We also maintain significant expense discipline that drove adjusted EBITDA to increase 10% year-over-year. \u2047 Those results are the primary drivers of our increased guidance for the year. \u2047 Doug is going to provide a couple of more details on that in a moment. \u2047 I do want to remind you that one factor that impacted year-over-year comparability is the later iPhone launch. \u2047 So last year, the device launch was late in the third quarter and as you know it was in October of this year. \u2047 We're excited about this launch and how that new timing is serving as the kick off to this very non-traditional and pandemic-influenced holiday selling season. \u2047 The timing should also help us to spread customer traffic out over the holiday-selling season and it's a really important consideration to keep our customers and our employees safe during the pandemic. \u2047 Similar to previous launches, we have competitive offers that appeal we believe to both new customers and our existing customers who are ready to upgrade their devices. \u2047 And we're really pleased that the new iPhone 12 series of devices support our network requirements and that includes full support 5G, 600 megahertz spectrum that we're currently deploying as well as millimeter wave in the future. \u2047 Like all businesses we continue to face challenges from the pandemic. \u2047 The safety of our frontline associates and our customers is of utmost importance. \u2047 Our stores remained open throughout the quarter but store traffic continues to trend below prior year levels. \u2047 We continue to have favorable experience in terms of customer payment behavior and that contributed to the year-over-year favorability in bad debt expense. \u2047 In addition, with respect to our participation in the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge 70% of customers that participated in the pledge paid or made partial payment or entered into payment arrangements. \u2047 Talking just a bit about 5G. \u2047 On the 5G front, working with Qualcomm Technologies and Ericsson, we completed an extended range 5G millimeter wave data session over a distance of more than 5 kilometers with speeds ranging from 100 megabits per second near the edge to 1.8 gigabits per second closer to the cell site. \u2047 This is a world record and it means that we're going to be able to connect our communities with fiber-like speeds over wireless in the future and we're excited about that. \u2047 Our network modernization and our 5G program continues to be on track. \u2047 By year-end we're going to deploy 5G to cell sites that handle about 50% of our overall traffic. \u2047 We turn briefly to our organization, so I've spent the last couple of months speaking with customers, employees and leadership team and I have to tell you, we have a fantastic culture in this company, we have amazing associates, we have an award-winning network, we have great distribution and great customer care. \u2047 During the process of making some changes, we're going to promote even more organizational speed and agility. \u2047 This includes flattening the organization to create a faster and more decentralized decision-making process. \u2047 And as part of that we've redefined some of our leadership roles. \u2047 So Eric Jagher is now responsible for Consumer Sales and Operations, Courtland Madock is responsible for operational marketing, Verchele Roberts for Brand Management. \u2047 We've also brought in some terrific new talent like Kimberly Kerr into expanding our participation in the business in the government sector as well as Austin Summerford who is going to be focusing on business development, enhancing our partnership and maximizing the returns from our tower assets. \u2047 Jay has announced he is going to be retiring effective January 1, 2021. \u2047 He's currently serving as a special advisor to me. \u2047 And like most of you, we're watching closely and regularly refreshing our Twitter feeds to see updates with the situation. \u2047 And that being said, regardless of who occupies the White House, my hope and my expectation is that the administration will focus on improving and investing in American infrastructure. \u2047 As part of that, I think it's important to separate two issues that are critical to our customer base. \u2047 We don't really talk about this in other forums. \u2047 First, we need to ensure that strategies are put in place to ensure American competitiveness and leadership in 5G, particularly expanded access to spectrum for commercial use. \u2047 But secondly, we need to focus on ensuring access to quality, affordable wireless service. \u2047 That's regardless of G in difficult to reach and expensive to serve rural areas. \u2047 We're going to be focused on this as a company. \u2047 These are issues that we think will resonate regardless of who wins the election. \u2047 We're truly operating in unprecedented times and it requires a huge amount of operational flexibility. \u2047 We've had a really strong quarter, which is a testament to the hard work and the dedication of the team. \u2047 I think we're in a really strong position moving into the busy holiday season. \u2047 Let me touch briefly on the postpaid connections results during the third quarter shown on Slide 7. \u2047 Postpaid handset gross additions decreased primarily due to lower switching activity and decreased store traffic due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 and to a lesser extent the delayed iPhone launch. \u2047 This decrease is partially mitigated by increased demand for connected devices. \u2047 Total smartphone connections increased by 3,000 during the quarter and by 45,000 over the course of the past 12 months. \u2047 That helps to drive more service revenue given that smartphone ARPU is about $21 higher than feature phone ARPU. \u2047 As mentioned, we saw connected device gross additions increase by 27,000 year-over-year. \u2047 This was driven by gross additions of hotspots, routers and fixed wireless devices as a result of an increase in demand by customers seeking wireless products to meet their need for remote connectivity due to the impacts of COVID-19. \u2047 During Q3, we saw an average year-over-year decline in store traffic of 25% related to the impacts of COVID as well as some heavier activity in the prior year when we had service plan pricing changes and the iPhone launch. \u2047 The decrease in store traffic had a negative impact on gross additions although connected device activity remains stronger than prior year. \u2047 Next, I want to comment on the postpaid churn rate shown on Slide 8. \u2047 Currently, as you would expect, churn on both handsets and connected devices is running at very low levels. \u2047 Postpaid handset churn depicted by the blue bars was 0.88% down from 1.09% a year ago. \u2047 This was due primarily to lowered switching activity as customer shopping behaviors were altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 And we also saw more customers upgrading their devices with us resulting in a 4% increase in upgrade transactions year-over-year. \u2047 The FCC Keep Americans Connected Pledge ended on June 30th and 70% of the customers that were on the pledge at June 30th are current or remain at payment arrangements. \u2047 Total postpaid churn combining handsets and connected devices was 1.06% for the third quarter of 2020 also lower than a year ago. \u2047 Now let's turn to the financial results on Slide 9. \u2047 Total operating revenues for the third quarter were $1.027 billion, a slight decrease year-over-year. \u2047 Retail service revenues increased by $11 million to $674 million. \u2047 The increase is due to a higher average revenue per user, which I'll cover on the next slide, partially offset by a decline in the average postpaid subscriber base. \u2047 Inbound roaming revenue was $42 million, that was a decrease of $12 million year-over-year driven by lower data rates and to a lesser extent a decrease in data volume. \u2047 Other service revenues were $59 million, an increase in $2 million year-over-year due to an increase in tower rental revenues and miscellaneous other service revenues partially offset by a prior year tower rental revenues accounting adjustment that increased tower rental revenues in the prior year. \u2047 Finally equipment sales revenues decreased by $5 million year-over-year due to a decrease in new smartphone unit sales and lower accessory sales. \u2047 Now a few more comments about postpaid revenue shown on Slide 10. \u2047 Average revenue per user or connection was $47.10 for the third quarter, up $0.94 cents or approximately 2% year-over-year. \u2047 At a per account basis average revenue grew by $3.40 or 3% year-over-year. \u2047 The increase was driven by several factors including increased device protection revenues, an increase in regulatory recovery revenues and having proportionately fewer tablet connections, which on a per unit basis contribute less revenue than smartphones. \u2047 As part of caring for our customers during the COVID-19 crisis, we elected to waive overage charges from March through July. \u2047 These waived charges partially offset the increases to ARPU. \u2047 Turning to Slide 11 as we continue our multi-year network modernization and 5G rollout, control of our towers remains very important. \u2047 We have added this slide to provide visibility to rental income growth from our towers. \u2047 By owning our towers we ensure that we are located at the optimal location of the tower and it gives us the operational flexibility to move equipment, which is very important when you're going through a technology evolution. \u2047 While the towers support our network strategy, we also recognize that they are valuable and provide a financing alternative, which we evaluate along with our other financing options. \u2047 As you can see on the slide, since we entered into a third-party marketing agreement, we have seen steady growth in tower rental revenues. \u2047 We will continue to focus on growing revenues from these strategic assets. \u2047 Moving to Slide 12. \u2047 I want to comment on adjusted operating income for depreciation, amortization and accretion and gains and losses. \u2047 To keep things simple, I'll refer to this measure as adjusted operating income. \u2047 As shown at the bottom of the slide adjusted operating income was $232 million, an increase of $24 million or 12% year-over-year. \u2047 As I commented earlier, total operating revenues were $1.027 billion, a slight decrease year-over-year. \u2047 Total cash expenses were $795 million, decreasing $28 million or 3% year-over-year. \u2047 Total system operations expense increased year-over-year. \u2047 Excluding roaming expense, system operations expense increased by 1% mainly driven by higher sell site rent expense. \u2047 Note that total system usage grew by 54% year-over-year. \u2047 Roaming expense increased $2 million or 5% year-over-year due to a 69% increase in off-net data usage partially offset by lower rates. \u2047 Cost of equipment sold decreased $9 million or 4% year-over-year due primarily to a reduction in the number of new smartphone unit sales and a decrease in accessory sales. \u2047 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $23 million or 6% year-"], "gold_summary": ["q3 revenue $1.027 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $998.7 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share $0.94.
