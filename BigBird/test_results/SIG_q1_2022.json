{"article": ["On the call today are Signet's CEO, Gina Drosos; and CFO, Joan Hilson. \u2047 Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. \u2047 During the call, we'll discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 For further discussion of the non-GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of them to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the news release we posted on our website at www. \u2047 We are embracing new capabilities in connected commerce with excellence as evidenced in this quarter's results. \u2047 Further to this, we are unlocking our team members' potential. \u2047 We know from listening and from our ongoing surveys that our team members are inspired by our purpose. \u2047 They're proud to be part of our organization and they're confident in the tightly integrated strategies that are guiding our growth. \u2047 Our team members' inspiration, pride, confidence, expertise, and growing digital capabilities are the most important drivers of my confidence in our long-term success. \u2047 It is an honor to work at their side. \u2047 As I reviewed Signet's performance in Q1, I want to leave you with three messages. \u2047 Number one, we outperformed Q1 expectations and are raising our fiscal '22 guidance today. \u2047 Number two, we're making steady progress in all four of our where to play strategic focus areas and all three of our how to win core strengths: consumer-inspired insights, connected commerce presence, and our culture of innovation and agility. \u2047 We are continuing to expand these strengths because we know they are sources of competitive advantage. \u2047 We're outpacing market growth. \u2047 And as a result, we're growing share. \u2047 I'll talk through each of these points but first, let's look high level at the Q1 numbers. \u2047 Total sales were $1.7 billion, an increase of more than $250 million, or 18%, compared to Q1 two years ago. \u2047 This is significant because two years ago, we had 467 more stores than we have today. \u2047 E-commerce is playing an increasingly important role with sales up more than 110% in the quarter versus last year and 124% versus two years ago. \u2047 Cash flow from operating activities of $161 million year to date was up $169 million compared to last year and $56 million compared to two years ago. \u2047 Having already paid down debt and with $1.3 billion of cash at quarter-end, we are continuing to invest in growing our business and, as Joan will discuss, returning cash to shareholders. \u2047 Ending inventory was $2 billion, $373 million lower than last year. \u2047 Our inventory reduction efforts are now institutionalized, less about rationalization and more about optimizing our merchandise mix and availability, getting the right product to the right places to maximize the speed of delivery and sales. \u2047 Our digital capabilities give customers access to virtually every piece of jewelry in our system, no matter where it is, which is unlocking new levels of inventory productivity, so this has become more than a working capital story. \u2047 We are increasing our ability to flow newness into our inventory pipeline, bringing more innovative new products to more customers more frequently. \u2047 And with data analytics, we're ensuring we have optimized assortments where we need them. \u2047 Our Q1 performance demonstrates that we are off to a strong start implementing phase 2 of Signet's transformation, which we call Inspiring Brilliance. \u2047 On that note, I want to transition now to taking a closer look at the progress we're making in each of the four where to play strategic focus areas that we outlined two months ago in our virtual investor event. \u2047 First, we are winning in our biggest businesses. \u2047 Our strategy for keeping our core strong and growing is holistic. \u2047 It begins with the work we've done to differentiate our banners, including merchandise assortment, price tiers, balancing self-purchase and gifting, and offering brands that are designed to appeal to each banner's distinct target customer. \u2047 For example, we're generating compelling and highly targeted content that's tailored for each channel where we communicate with customers and for the moment in their journey when they are engaging with us. \u2047 Our merchandise assortment is also uniquely targeted for each banner, including Neil Lane and Adrianna Papell at Kay, Vera Wang and Disney Enchanted at Zales, Levian and Pnina Tornai at Jared, and others across our portfolio. \u2047 Perhaps most importantly, we're focused on product. \u2047 Our merchants are continuing to innovate and scour the market for emerging ideas. \u2047 In bridal, this means larger, high-quality diamonds with more radiance and sleeker designs. \u2047 For the gift giver, collections with meaning really help our customers express their feelings. \u2047 And for the self-purchasing woman and man, our most innovative collections reflect the style changes that we have seen this year: yellow gold, layered neckpieces, and fully outfitted ears. \u2047 We're finding that customers want to wear jewelry with all looks, including casual, athleisure, professional, and they want to do so particularly now that they are reigniting their social lives. \u2047 Our differentiated banner propositions are working. \u2047 All of our U.S. banners delivered double-digit revenue growth compared to two years ago. \u2047 We attribute much of this to the success we're having in attracting new customers across our banners with our holistic marketing and customer experience strategies while maintaining the loyalty of existing customers as well. \u2047 For example, roughly 60% of our sales growth in Q1 across Kay and Zales came from new customers. \u2047 We've benefited from stimulus spending and other tailwinds, of course, but we believe that we've captured more than our fair share of this spending by having the right targeted assortments with the right level of newness differentiated by banner. \u2047 This is evidenced by Kay's strong growth in gifting and Zales' self-purchase. \u2047 Further, increasingly optimized assortments for our target customers led to an ATV increase of nearly 20% in these banners versus two years ago. \u2047 When we combine our knowledge of product as a jeweler and our knowledge of customers as a retailer, along with the scale of our data-driven operations, we win, especially in our biggest businesses. \u2047 Second, we're making progress on our strategy to accelerate services, which are returning to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Services are especially important because they are a long-term relationship builder, the glue that connects a lifetime value of relationship and purchases between a customer and our Signet team. \u2047 We jump-started services in Q1 in several ways. \u2047 We enhanced our financial services by expanding and strengthening payment offerings for customers. \u2047 We recently announced a new and more favorable agreement with two long-term partners, ADS and Genesis. \u2047 This gives us the ability to provide more payment flexibility more simply and more profitably than we could before. \u2047 We're also continuing to expand customization services. \u2047 This remains a growing trend. \u2047 Among recently engaged people, 13% designed their ring from scratch. \u2047 We're offering customization tools across all our largest banners. \u2047 With the Vera Wang love configurator, Zales' customers can choose a diamond or a gemstone center. \u2047 Kay enables customers to create a completely customizable engagement ring with a create-your-own-design tool or design a ring with Neil Lane to get that handcrafted Hollywood glamour style just the way they want. \u2047 And Jared customers have a variety of ways to put their personal touches on jewelry, whether adding an engraved phrase to a ring or working directly with Jared artisans online or in person at one of our in-store foundry studios. \u2047 Consistent with this, customization sales are up low double digits in Jared stores with a foundry. \u2047 We also continue to build on our investments in James Allen, a specialist in the custom jewelry space, and we're seeing strong results with more than 130% revenue growth to last year. \u2047 Further, we launched custom design and restoration events across Kay, Zales, and Jared in Q1. \u2047 We offered customers a 10% discount to bring in existing pieces of jewelry to be reimagined or restored to their previous brilliance. \u2047 These events, on their own, enabled us to exceed our goals for the quarter, and we plan to continue hosting them banner by banner going forward. \u2047 We're also moving into new areas such as jewelry rental subscriptions with the acquisition of Rocksbox, and we're quickly growing brand awareness through cross-promotion within our banners. \u2047 Jared, for example, offered customers a free two-month subscription to Rocksbox when purchasing a Jared piece, and then provided a bounceback coupon to anyone who activated a Rocksbox subscription. \u2047 We'll be offering a growing range of cross-banner promotions like this in the months ahead, including a Rocksbox rental offering partnership with Piercing Pagoda this summer. \u2047 We are building momentum and services, which we continue to believe is a billion-dollar growth opportunity on the path to the $9 billion overall revenue goal we laid out at our virtual investor event. \u2047 The third strategic focus area where we're making progress is expanding midmarket accessible luxury and value. \u2047 We're focused sharply on growing the top end of the midmarket with more intentional accessible luxury offerings. \u2047 For example, Jared's fastest growth this quarter came through higher price point merchandise, primarily above $3,000. \u2047 This includes Jared's new premium diamond assortment with sales of larger stones up roughly 30% to two years ago. \u2047 Chosen Platinum, Pnina Tornai, and Royal Asscher were strong merchandise drivers. \u2047 Piercing Pagoda is expanding our strength at the value end of the midmarket, delivering its strongest quarter ever in Q1. \u2047 Just to emphasize, ever means Q1 fiscal '22 was higher total revenue than any prior quarter for Pagoda, including fourth quarter. \u2047 Customers are highly receptive to our new assortment with particular emphasis on gold, which represents 75% of Pagoda sales. \u2047 Pagoda now has more than 135 stores on track to deliver $1 million in sales this year. \u2047 And we currently have four Pagoda locations that already have more than $1 million in sales to date this fiscal year, a feat that took until August to achieve in fiscal '20. \u2047 We're eager to keep Piercing Pagoda growing and highly relevant. \u2047 We're taking two critical steps in that direction by investing in advertising and launching a branding refresh. \u2047 The strong return on our additional investment in advertising was proven this quarter as we continued to increase Pagoda's banner awareness. \u2047 Sales were up three times to Q1 of last year and up 80% to two years ago on a smaller store base in both years. \u2047 Our second step, updating branding, is one that we believe will further accelerate our return on advertising spend. \u2047 Our customer research indicates that the Piercing Pagoda name doesn't have the same modernity that our merchandise and banner experience bring. \u2047 So we're testing the opportunity to freshen and broaden Pagoda's brand equity and attract new customers while retaining existing ones. \u2047 Our fourth strategy is to lead digital commerce in the jewelry industry. \u2047 Our ability to combine digital and in-store experiences at the scale we are able to is a significant competitive advantage and we're continuing to innovate and to invest in both. \u2047 For perspective, Kay delivered nearly 17% more brick-and-mortar sales per square foot of physical store space than in the first quarter two years ago. \u2047 And Zales is delivering 35% more. \u2047 In total, Q1 e-commerce sales were up more than 110% compared to last year, and brick-and-mortar same-store sales were up more than 105%. \u2047 As part of our growing connected commerce approach, we are integrating our physical stores into the digital customer experience with data-driven in-store consultations, buy online pickup in-store and curbside, and increasingly seamless interaction across our websites, stores, and inventory pipeline. \u2047 This integration is making a difference. \u2047 While physical foot traffic is still down compared to this time two years ago, we've delivered growth through both higher conversion and higher average transaction value. \u2047 We believe this is because we are starting to provide a best-in-class experience from the first touchpoint of the digital shopping experience, all the way through in-person store consultations and fulfillment. \u2047 We added more than 100 new features and capabilities across our digital platforms in Q1 to ensure every digital touchpoint is a moment of customer delight. \u2047 Virtual try-on for Kay drove over a 110% increase in its add-to-cart rate and nearly a 70% increase in order conversion in Q1. \u2047 We also rolled out Google Business Messages and Apple Business Chat, features that allow customers to engage virtual jewelry consultants in real-time or offline from search results or maps. \u2047 Applications like these are laying the groundwork for further enhancements later this year as we build our agile team infrastructure and iterative innovation capabilities. \u2047 Last year, we implemented virtual selling at the end of Q1 and had around 50,000 virtual interactions with customers. \u2047 This quarter, we had more than 450,000 virtual interactions. \u2047 And importantly, conversion is also improving as our teams' capabilities continue to mature. \u2047 Further, our cart to check out conversion rate is up, and the rate of site visits that turn into cart views is up as well. \u2047 Our digital development teams are not settling for creating the best online jewelry experience. \u2047 They're setting the bar higher by finding and innovating the best online consumer experiences in any category, and then bringing those experiences for our jewelry customers. \u2047 I'll share one quick example of how this integration and growing digital capability is working. \u2047 We recently worked with a customer who came to us through our virtual chat feature with a mission and a deadline. \u2047 He wanted to propose to his girlfriend the next day. \u2047 Erika, one of our virtual consultants, noticed the urgency in his messages, and she made it her mission to help him achieve his. \u2047 This customer's soon-to-be fiance had a dream ring in mind, a cushion-cut two-carat syn pave ring in white gold. \u2047 Erika immediately began searching our virtual inventory to identify stores nationwide that had or could create the piece he was looking for. \u2047 She found a store near him that had the cushion cut with the color, clarity, and size that he needed. \u2047 Erika connected him directly to that store. \u2047 The customer loved the ring and bought it on the spot, a $25,000 sale I might add. \u2047 The team set and sized the ring while he waited. \u2047 He proposed that evening, she said yes, and he sent our team photos of the happy moment. \u2047 This customer told us he loved being able to start his shopping journey virtually, look at pieces online, chat with a virtual consultant, have us do the shopping with him, and then have"], "gold_summary": ["signet jewelers' first quarter results exceed expectations.
