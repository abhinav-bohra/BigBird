calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. \u2047 These statements reflect the best information as of today. \u2047 All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions, expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. \u2047 They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. \u2047 These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. \u2047 Upfront here, I'll plan to cover three subjects. \u2047 First, I'll share my perspective on our Q2 results, along with rest of your outlook. \u2047 Second, I'll provide an update on our two newest acquisitions. \u2047 And then lastly, I'll talk about our fuel card business, including our latest view on EV, along with a couple of innovative developments underway in that business. \u2047 Let me turn to our Q2 results. \u2047 So very pleased to report outstanding Q2 financial results meaningfully above our internal expectations. \u2047 We reported Q2 revenue of $667 million that's up 27% and cash earnings per share of $3.15, up 38%. \u2047 Both our Q2 2021 revenue and cash earnings per share exceeded our Q2 2019 results, so finally moving past our pre-pandemic baseline. \u2047 Organic revenue growth came in at 23% for the quarter, our full AP outsourcing platform segment, up 53% versus Q2 last year. \u2047 The trends in the quarter are really quite good. \u2047 Our same-store sales metric improved to plus 18%, so hardness of 18%, many of the sectors in our client base recovering. \u2047 Retention, record level, we reached nearly 94%, an all-time high since we've been reporting the metric. \u2047 And interestingly, our global fuel card business reached 92% retention, also an all-time high. \u2047 Credit losses remain very good, running at historic levels and sales outstanding in the quarter finishing up almost two times last year's Q2 and up 6% against 2019. \u2047 Okay, let me transition to our view of the rest of the year. \u2047 So, today, we're raising guidance to $2.765 billion at the midpoint for full year revenue, raising cash earnings per share at the midpoint to $12.90. \u2047 That's driven by our Q2 beat, the AFEX close, and really the momentum that we have running into the second half. \u2047 I do want to remind everyone we had previously guided to a pretty substantial second half sequential step-up already. \u2047 As a reminder, cash earnings per share guidance up nearly $0.60 from the start of the year. \u2047 So, we opened the year at $12.30; today, $12.90, so obviously, better than we outlooked. \u2047 The second half guidance implies a few things. \u2047 So, first, the revenue growth will run about 20% ahead of last year and high single-digits really above the second half 2019 baseline. \u2047 So, we are expecting the business to reach all-time highs again in both revenues and profits. \u2047 Our Q4 earnings per share profit guidance implies nearly a $14 annualized cash earnings per share exit rate. \u2047 Okay, let me transition now to an update on our recent acquisitions. \u2047 So as a reminder, we closed AFEX, that's the add-on cross-border deal, on June 1st. \u2047 And then last week, we signed definitive documents to acquire ALE, which is a lodging provider to the insurance vertical. \u2047 So, let me start with ALE, really a highly complementary add-on to our existing lodging business and that company brings a whole set of specialized capabilities designed just to serve the insurance vertical. \u2047 So, we've got a pretty interesting synergy plan for that business and expect accelerated revenue and profit growth next year. \u2047 We're also well underway on our AFEX integration. \u2047 We've already exited about $10 million of run rate payroll expense. \u2047 We've implemented one unified cross-border management organization and we've designed an IT consolidation plan to move to a single system. \u2047 That will significantly reduce run rate IT and operations expense. \u2047 So, look, both of these acquisitions, classic FLEET wheelhouse deals. \u2047 We paid reasonable prices. \u2047 There are extensions of our existing business, so we know them well, and both have very rich synergy opportunities. \u2047 We're expecting the businesses to grow about 20% on the top on a pro forma basis next year and together deliver incremental cash earnings per share in 2022 in the $0.50 to $0.70 range, so big upside. \u2047 So, obviously, we are quite enthusiastic about the transactions. \u2047 Let me shift gears now and talk a bit about our fuel card business, which we continue to love and which we think has a bright future. \u2047 So I'll talk a bit about EV, the latest and greatest, and then talk about innovation and specifically two new things that we're doing to improve the growth prospects of our fuel card business. \u2047 So starting out with EV. \u2047 I mentioned last time, we're really embracing EV as an opportunity and in no way see it putting an end to our fuel card business. \u2047 Employers are going to need to reimburse employees for recharging electric vehicles much like they reimburse employees for refueling combustion engines. \u2047 And I think you may find that it costs more to operate EV than people think. \u2047 We also think there'll be some new economics and that we've got an opportunity to achieve, very similar economics from EV measuring and reimbursing as we do from combustion engines. \u2047 We've included a couple of EV exhibits in our Q2 earnings supplement. \u2047 You'll see some comparisons of spend where the cost of public charging is about 70% of fossil fuel charging. \u2047 And then because there's more attractive MDR rates, we believe that we can achieve pretty interesting revenue there as well. \u2047 In a nutshell, we expect the at-home software subscription fees to be pretty significant and augment a number of the other fees that we get in the revenue mix. \u2047 We are outlooking the commercial transition to EV to be slow, particularly here in the US, giving us ample time to build out our public charging network and implement recharging at home. \u2047 We expect mixed fleets to be how things start out. \u2047 So our incumbent position should give us quite an advantage in consolidating activity and data for our clients. \u2047 So look, in conclusion, we're outlooking EV to really just be a different way to serve commercial fleets but one in which we think can still be attractive. \u2047 Let me leave EV and cut over to the couple of innovations that we're working in the fuel card business. \u2047 So first is digital and particularly digital selling, which now in Q2 has reached about 60% of all our new fuel card sales globally coming to us digitally. \u2047 So lots of improvements in our digital selling capabilities. \u2047 We've got automated keyword bidding now. \u2047 We've redesigned our maximize sales conversion, and we're beginning investments at the top of the funnel in the form of digital TV, radio, Facebook advertising, which is driving about 50% more visitors to our websites, so obviously leading to incremental sales. \u2047 The last innovation I'd like to touch on is our effort to transform our fuel card UI, which is used by over 100,000 clients, really into a broader payment platform. \u2047 So we're combining our newest cloud-based SMB bill pay platform with our fuel card UI, so that clients go on to pay us the fuel card bill that they'd have the option then of paying additional vendors with the same software platform. \u2047 So, this idea is really aimed at accelerating the number of active bill pay clients we can add to our platform and again beginning the transformation of the fuel card business into a corporate payments business. \u2047 So, we'll keep you updated there as we go. \u2047 So, look, in closing, three thoughts for you. \u2047 So, one, on 2021, again, we're pleased with Q2, particularly the record retention and record sales levels. \u2047 And again, our second half outlook calls for new all-time highs again in revenue and profits. \u2047 Second, on the fuel card business, again, we think the prospects are bright for the business. \u2047 We do have a plan to monetize EV adoption by providing some new services and particularly measuring and reimbursing at-home recharging. \u2047 We've got an opportunity to keep stepping up digital sales and digital advertising at the top of the funnel. \u2047 We think we can drive incremental visitors and incremental sales. \u2047 And we're launching a bill pay cross-sell opportunity to our fuel card clients again by turning our existing fuel UI into a broader payment platform. \u2047 And lastly, although early, we're quite encouraged by our 2022 setup. \u2047 Our second half guidance calls for nearly $7 in cash earnings per share for the second half or approximately $14 annualized, again, forecasting record sales for the full year, which will flow revenue into next year. \u2047 We'll roll off $1 billion in interest rate hedges in January. \u2047 That will free up about $0.20 of incremental cash EPS. \u2047 And lastly, our two newest acquisitions, hoping to contribute in the $0.50 to $0.70 range of incremental cash EPS. \u2047 So, look, taken together a lot to like about our 2022 setup. \u2047 He'll provide some additional details on the quarter. \u2047 I'm delighted to share with you the results of a very good quarter. \u2047 For Q2 of 2021, we reported revenue of $667 million, up 27%; GAAP net income up 24% to $196 million; and GAAP net income per diluted share up 26% to $2.30. \u2047 Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 36% to $268 million and ANI per diluted share increased 38% to $3.15 as we finally lapped the worst of COVID. \u2047 Organic revenue growth improved 29 points sequentially to up 23% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong sales, record retention levels, and same-store sales recovery. \u2047 Looking at organic growth across the categories. \u2047 Corporate payments was up 32% in the second quarter, led by our full AP solutions. \u2047 We are seeing very good success leading with our full AP and selling a more complete package versus just a stand-alone virtual card offering. \u2047 Full AP is clearly what we prefer to sell, so we've reoriented our combined sales force with this focus, and it's paying off. \u2047 T&E card revenue was up 58% year-over-year, rebounding significantly as business activity and travel began to resume. \u2047 This T&E description is a bit of a misnomer, as it's really a multipurpose card that can be used as either a purchasing card or is walk-around plastic, depending on how the customer wants to use it. \u2047 And while spending within T&E-related categories has rebounded, it's still below historical levels. \u2047 So there's clearly room for further improvement there. \u2047 Cross-border revenue was up 25%. \u2047 These results do include one month of AFEX with pro forma results for Q2 last year, so which is if we owned it in both periods. \u2047 And finally, virtual card revenue was up 13%. \u2047 Both of these areas are still affected by COVID softness in industries that we've discussed before, like airlines, cruise operators, hotels and restaurants, international trade and commercial construction to a lesser extent. \u2047 We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict. \u2047 Fuel was up organically 19% year-over-year with strong retention trends and record digital sales helping to drive the performance. \u2047 We still see opportunities for further softness recoveries in fuel once the labor shortage affecting our large trucking fleet customer subsides and offices reopen more broadly so our white-collar commuters can return to normal activity levels. \u2047 Tolls was up 9% compared with last year and showed impressive performance in light of the lockdowns in place for much of the quarter. \u2047 This growth was driven by record first half tag sales, demonstrating the value proposition and attractiveness of our offerings even when many folks aren't driving on the roads. \u2047 And approximately one quarter of all consumer tags sold year-to-date are signed up to urban plans, which allow purchases beyond tolls, such as for parking, fueling and fast food. \u2047 We also added 25% more fuel stations to our tag acceptance network during the first half with plans to add another 50% during the second half. \u2047 The combination of urban tag sales and non-toll network expansion should produce beyond total volume growth as lockdowns ease and consumer activity increases. \u2047 Lodging was up 39%, with workforce up 36%. \u2047 The pace of improvement in workforce lodging has leveled off some as customers are being held back by the labor shortage, but we feel this volume will come back over time as the labor market normalizes. \u2047 Airline lodging was up 49% as domestic air travel recovered faster than expected but still remains below historical norms. \u2047 International airline lodging should come back as international air travel recovers. \u2047 So despite the sizable recovery in lodging, we still see upside potential here. \u2047 Gift organic growth was 22% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel. \u2047 We expect this trend to continue as we are experiencing success with gift clients using our proprietary platform to sell both digital and physical cards online. \u2047 In fact, we expect to double the number of clients utilizing this platform by year-end. \u2047 Momentum in mobile wallet services and B2B sales, where third parties sell gift cards to companies for use as employee incentives and rewards, are also contributing to the improvement. \u2047 Looking further down the income statement. \u2047 Our operating expenses were up 18% to $370 million, totaling 55% of revenue. \u2047 The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. \u2047 We've also made incremental investments in digital sales and top-of-funnel marketing efforts and incurred some non-recurring integration-related expenses for AFEX, such as severance and platform migration costs. \u2047 Operating margins improved four points from last year to 45% due to recovering volumes that have higher margins, higher fuel prices, and solid expense control. \u2047 In the quarter, bad debt was $6 million or two basis points. \u2047 Credit performance continues to be strong, although we do expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales improve and grow. \u2047 Interest expense increased 7% to $34.7 million due to a $6.2 million charge associated with our debt refinance, a higher balance on the"], "gold_summary": ["sees q3 adjusted earnings per share $3.35 to $3.55.  \u2047  q2 adjusted earnings
