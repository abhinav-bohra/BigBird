{"article": ["Any of these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections. \u2047 Additional information about factors that may cause our actual results to differ from projections is contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and in other company SEC filings. \u2047 On the call today, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. \u2047 We're off to a very solid start to 2021, as we expected, signaling our accelerating recovery from the pandemic. \u2047 Our year-over-year rate of revenue decline in the first quarter improved meaningfully on a sequential basis, and we posted substantial improvements in adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Importantly, we told you we would deliver on this a year ago, and we delivered as promised. \u2047 Once again, saying what we're going to do and then doing what we say. \u2047 Our payments segment led the way for Deluxe, showing solid performance and continuing to deliver for our customers. \u2047 We have also seen improvements in our data-driven marketing, part of our Cloud Solutions business, which reinforces our optimism about around the rest of the year. \u2047 We generated[Indecipherable] despite continued COVID-related pressures and the impact of severe weather conditions in many parts of the U.S. in February. \u2047 There are some highlights from the quarter. \u2047 Revenue was $441 million with a rate of decline on a year-over-year basis of 9%, a meaningful sequential improvement over the fourth quarter decline of nearly 13%. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin improved nearly 340 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share improved nearly 17%. \u2047 Free cash flow improved 47% year-over-year to $18 million. \u2047 We've improved liquidity in each of the last four quarters, and our net debt is now at the lowest level in nearly three years, which is a testament to the team's financial acumen and our responsible and prudent fiscal stewardship through the crisis. \u2047 In terms of sales, the first quarter was the strongest we've ever had in terms of annual contract value, or ACV. \u2047 We closed more than 1,600 deals, including the single largest win in Deluxe history with financial services leader, PNC, as well as the significant deal with TD Bank. \u2047 We closed 20 deals with ACV over $1 million each. \u2047 And the top six deals had a combined ACV of over $50 million. \u2047 Since we started our One Deluxe sales approach over six quarters ago and including a recent win which was signed in April, we have closed nine of the 13 largest deals of the last decade and two of the largest in company's history. \u2047 Of course, we still must implement all of these wins, but our continued sales success adds to our already strong confidence in our future. \u2047 Across the company, we remained laser focused on our One Deluxe go-to-market strategy, accelerating our historic transformation through 2020 and into 2021 in the midst of a global pandemic. \u2047 Our success and our now proven strategy put us in the position to announce the largest acquisition in the company's 106-year history, First American Payment Systems, which is expected to close later in this current quarter. \u2047 By acquiring First American, we're confirming our strategy to transform into a payments and trusted business technology company. \u2047 The transaction will expand our payments business by adding merchant services to our product offering and will double the size of the Payments segment to approximately $600 million with 20% plus adjusted EBITDA margins and strong growth rates. \u2047 Importantly, after the transaction closes, Payments will now rival our check business on a revenue basis. \u2047 As you will recall and as I've communicated on several occasions, we have five prerequisites to reengaging on M&A. \u2047 Our Q4 earnings call and again at the First American payment transaction call on April 22, I confirmed we had met all 5. \u2047 As a reminder, those prerequisites were: first, a scalable, modern technology platform; second, a sales organization capable of selling the entire portfolio; third, a product function capable of adding features and new solutions; fourth, a world-class team; and fifth, to strengthen our balance sheet. \u2047 We refer to all of these actions as One Deluxe, another example of saying what we will do and doing what we say. \u2047 Having fulfilled these prerequisites, we're ready to expand our business through a major strategic, logical and responsible acquisition. \u2047 First American will be a great fit. \u2047 With that, let me now turn to sales. \u2047 We continue to make significant progress in becoming a sales-driven revenue growth company as we now signed the two largest deals in company's history in less than six months with PNC and Truist as we continue to unify our go-to-market sales approach to drive growth. \u2047 We continue with new business at an accelerated rate, and we're successfully cross-selling our products and services. \u2047 Let's talk about the PNC deal for a moment. \u2047 Here, we further expanded our existing relationship with a new multiyear partnership with the eighth largest commercial bank in the U.S., leveraging services from our core Deluxe data-driven marketing solution, complemented by promotional and multiple other Deluxe products, including our proprietary artificial data tools, strategic sourcing framework and delivery optimization algorithm, we will help PNC find and bring on new customers with improved speed to market, better value, increased efficiency and continuous innovation. \u2047 This is an important example of the power of expanding an existing relationship to include other existing Deluxe services. \u2047 The company's old operating silos would never have even identified the opportunity, much less combined multiple existing products to create a compelling solution for PNC. \u2047 This is more evident, proving our One Deluxe strategy really works. \u2047 Some of our key wins for the quarter include: in Payments, we have extended our relationship with BBVA with a significant number of Deluxe mobile capture solution licenses to support its end consumer and small business customers. \u2047 In Cloud, aside from PNC, which will also benefit our Promotional Solutions segment, key wins include another top 50 financial institution, where we will deliver full end-to-end campaign management services for its branch transformation initiatives. \u2047 We also signed the top mortgage originator in the U.S., where we will offer prescreen and mail services to support their customer acquisition and recapture programs. \u2047 In Promotional Solutions and beyond the PNC transaction, Deluxe has expanded its relationship with LPL Financial. \u2047 LPL will use the Deluxe brand center platform to efficiently rebrand newly acquired strategic broker-dealers with all pertinent marketing and operational materials while supporting regulatory compliance. \u2047 In checks, we successfully extended and expanded our contractual check relationships across several top-tier financial institutions. \u2047 In addition, we recently closed on a significant deal with TD Bank, the seventh largest bank in North America. \u2047 Our recently enhanced check products and importantly, the strength of our balance sheet, enable us to continue to win market share and protect our outstanding cash flow. \u2047 Of course, it will take time to onboard these wins, but our One Deluxe strategy is clearly working, and we're on pace to significantly exceed last year's record sales performance. \u2047 Moving on to some segment highlights. \u2047 Payments had a solid quarter, growing beyond the major wins in Q1 last year, and the impact of the[Indecipherable], we continue to work on our implementation backlog and expect acceleration as COVID-related implementation customer delays fade away over the coming months. \u2047 Our treasury management business led the way this quarter. \u2047 As a reminder, services here include automation and intelligence, lockbox processing, remote. \u2047 Our digital payments business, which includes the Deluxe payment exchange and medical payment exchange, while relatively small, more than doubled year over year, and we remain very optimistic about this business. \u2047 This success highlights our ability to add new features and build new products successfully. \u2047 During the quarter, we are pleased to have conducted a soft launch of our HR management solution. \u2047 Small- and medium-sized businesses and integrated HR and payroll platform with a modern user experience, another example of our new product building capability. \u2047 We also expanded the Deluxe Payment Exchange network, which builds upon our digital payment products to now also include digital payments directly into lockboxes. \u2047 Our[Indecipherable] has been implemented for medical claims payments, and will be expanded from there. \u2047 We are very optimistic on the potential growth prospects for both of these new offerings. \u2047 In Cloud Solutions, we've made important progress on adding a number of new clients. \u2047 As we discussed before, our 2021 cloud revenue performance will be impacted by the exits and divestitures we made in 2020. \u2047 Excluding these impacts, the cloud rate of decline was about 10% or just over half of the reported rate, and sequentially before the business grew 5%. \u2047 All of this provides us confidence in the trajectory of this business. \u2047 Keith will discuss this in more detail. \u2047 We are particularly optimistic about our data-driven marketing prospects as the economy recovers. \u2047 As expected, we can see that lift off beginning in our first quarter. \u2047 We have good visibility now into the rest of the year as we partner with our financial institution customers, planning multiple large-scale marketing campaigns, adding to our confidence for 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Our website services also showed resiliency when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by stronger client retention as favorable exchange rates. \u2047 We did see encouraging signs for recovery in our corporation services as we previously announced. \u2047 Turning now to our Promotional Solutions segment. \u2047 The business was affected by continued COVID-related lockdowns, particularly in the Northeast and West Coast, along with severe winter weather in February. \u2047 Despite these impacts, the rate of decline improved for the fourth quarter of 2020 and we are very optimistic about this segment's prospects as the recovery unfolds. \u2047 Importantly, adjusted EBITDA margin improved over 600 basis points year over year, which Keith will also touch on in a moment. \u2047 Our business essentials line where we deliver custom forms and other products that businesses consume in their routine operations performed well during the quarter and is a leading indicator of the nation's overall economic rebound. \u2047 We expect to see a recovery in branded merchandise as events and in-person activities return as COVID wanes. \u2047 Finally, our highly profitable cash generating checks business continue to be impacted by secular trends combined with the dual impact of the pandemic and severe weather. \u2047 Importantly, we expect the accelerated COVID recovery, plus our market share gains to significantly reduce the rate of decline over the course of the year. \u2047 Early evidence of this recovery can be seen in the sequential improvement and revenue decline rates between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. \u2047 Our strategy in checks remains focused on capturing new share, while holding margin percentage flat and making smart investments, giving a strong cash flow to invest in payments and cloud. \u2047 And the strategy is working, helping us win some of the largest deals in the company's history, expand into Canada and land multiple significant competitive takeaways. \u2047 In summary, our recovery is accelerating and our margin percentage is expanding. \u2047 We improved liquidity for the fourth consecutive quarter, and now net debt is at the lowest level in almost three years. \u2047 All four businesses are experiencing positive momentum to start the year. \u2047 Our transformation into a sales-driven payments and trusted business technology company is yielding results and will accelerate with the addition of First American. \u2047 Our One Deluxe strategy is clearly working, and our execution is strong. \u2047 This really is a new Deluxe, a payments and trusted business technology company. \u2047 Now, we'll turn over to Keith, who will provide you more details on our financial performance. \u2047 As Barry mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results. \u2047 While we felt the continuing effects of COVID as well as the impact from severe weather conditions in February, we delivered improvements in sequential quarterly trends. \u2047 This performance was in line with our guidance and highlights the accelerating recovery we expected as we move through the rest of the year. \u2047 Let's go through the enterprise level highlights for the quarter before moving on to the segments. \u2047 We posted total revenue of $441.3 million. \u2047 While this is a decline of 9.3% as compared to the same period last year, importantly, it was a 360 basis point improvement in the rate of decline experienced in the prior quarter. \u2047 We reported GAAP net income of $24.3 million in the quarter. \u2047 Year-over-year comparability is not meaningful given the asset impairment charges taken during the first quarter of 2020 related to the anticipated effects of COVID. \u2047 Our measures of adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA exclude these noncash charges, along with restructuring, integration and other costs. \u2047 These adjustments are detailed in the reconciliations provided in our release. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.6% to $90.5 million and adjusted EBITDA margin improved nearly 340 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%. \u2047 These improvements were largely driven by reductions in SG&A, and we have aligned expenses to our post-COVID operating model and continue progress against internal value realization initiatives. \u2047 Now turning to our segment details. \u2047 Consistent with our expectations shared on the fourth quarter call, Payments grew Q1 revenue 3.2% year-over-year to $79.5 million. \u2047 Payments also grew nearly 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter. \u2047 The quarterly performance was led by our treasury management business, which grew 4% year-over-year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.7% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23%, down 40 basis points as product mix impacted gross profit rates versus the prior year. \u2047 We continue to expect double-digit revenue growth for the full year as we continue to work on implementing the backlog of new clients we signed in 2020 and in Q1 of 2021. \u2047 We continue to invest to drive growth and bring on all of our wins. \u2047 And as such, we are assuming adjusted EBITDA margins will remain in the low 20% range through the year. \u2047 Of course, the payments numbers will change significantly with the exciting addition of First American Payment Systems later in the year. \u2047 I will provide details on that in a moment. \u2047 Cloud Solutions revenue results point to the recovery, but the business is performing better than the reported results imply. \u2047 Business exits and divestitures taken in 2020[Indecipherable] the reported results. \u2047 To provide you with better clarity, in addition to providing our GAAP results, we will also share cloud revenue performance, excluding these business exits and divestitures. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, revenue declined 18.2% year-over-year to $62.2 million in the quarter, but increased 5% sequentially from Q4. \u2047 8% of the year-"], "gold_summary": ["deluxe corp - qtrly revenue $441.3 million versus $486.4 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q4 adjusted
