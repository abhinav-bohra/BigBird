{"article": ["Before we begin, I'd like to review the Safe Harbor statements. \u2047 During the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Additionally, the content of this conference call may contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this earnings call. \u2047 We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise this information. \u2047 I will now turn the conference over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Lambiase. \u2047 I'd like to start by saying that all the employees at Chimera are healthy and working remotely from home. \u2047 We implemented our contingency work plan in early March, and have not experienced any significant technology issues. \u2047 We all hope view and your family stay safe and healthy as well. \u2047 In the month of March, the COVID-19 pandemic created an environment of fear and extreme uncertainty resulting in near catastrophic conditions for the fixed income markets. \u2047 Many investors felt that the government mandated lockdowns would likely bring an economic recession and they sold their credit investments while reinvesting into safer risk-off assets such as T-Bills, U.S. Treasury notes and cash. \u2047 Credit-focused bond funds and ETFs saw record outflows forcing fund managers to sell their holdings into thin markets creating heightened volatility and market dislocations. \u2047 All sectors of the fixed income market, apart from U.S. treasuries, experienced sharp downward price movements. \u2047 So investors who use leverage as part of their strategies we're also forced to sell assets as they attempted to meet margin calls from their repo lenders. \u2047 Market conditions witnessed in March of 2020 were very similar to that experienced in the the 2008 crisis. \u2047 Yet, price movements were swift and occurred over a much shorter timeframe. \u2047 The Federal Reserve was quick to respond and on March 15, a Sunday night, they announced many initiatives to combat the worsening economic conditions. \u2047 The Federal funds rate was cut to 0%, new purchase plans for treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities were implemented and funding programs like the TELS and commercial paper facility were revived from the 2008 Federal Reserve playbook. \u2047 The Fed's actions were largely helpful bringing order to many areas of fixed income market including agency mortgage-backed securities. \u2047 Liquidity programs for residential credit securities were not offered by the Federal Reserve and they continue to trade in a challenged fashion in the secondary markets. \u2047 Like the Fed, Congress also did its part by passing the CARES Act with the intent to help individuals most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 The U.S. economy is vastly different today than where it was prior to the COVID-19 crisis. \u2047 The abrupt shutdown in the U.S. economy has swiftly created some of the worst economic problems since the Great Depression. \u2047 In these past six weeks, 30 million people have applied for unemployment benefits, a sharp contrast to the 3.5% unemployment rate that we had in February. \u2047 Many U.S. homeowners have decided to take advantage of newly created mortgage forbearance programs. \u2047 In the near term, the government initiatives, coupled with mortgage forbearance, will soften the immediate blow to the U.S. economy. \u2047 But these may have lasting negative impact on the housing and mortgage market, should they persist for an extended period. \u2047 Over the past several years, Chimera has taken a number of balance sheet initiatives that helped it in this difficult period to protect our book value to meet all the margin calls from our repo lenders and to pay our dividends. \u2047 Our agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio has always served dual purposes, primarily as a source of spread income, and secondarily as a source of liquidity rather than selling our higher yielding legacy assets. \u2047 This quarter, we sold our agency pass-through securities to pay down debt and further deleverage our overall portfolio. \u2047 We ended the first quarter at 2.2 times recourse leverage, down 35% from year-end. \u2047 Over the past decade, we've purchased or acquired approximately a $14 billion portfolio of legacy non-agency securities and season-low loan balance mortgages. \u2047 This portfolio is funded through securitization as well as repo leverage, but it has not been immune to downward price movements. \u2047 We've worked diligently to protect this portfolio, which has historically been a consistent driver of earnings for our company and makes Chimera's portfolio differentiated in the mortgage REIT industry. \u2047 We remain hopeful that at some point in the future, the pricing of these assets reverts to it's fundamental value, rather than the illiquid pricing we're currently experiencing. \u2047 A restarting of the economy should be a good first step in the process, which we believe could lead to an improvement in credit spreads and a recapturing of our lost book value experienced in the quarter. \u2047 In the last few months, we've been busy executing transactions on the liability side of our balance sheet. \u2047 In March, Chimera executed two mortgage securitizations, totaling $883 million. \u2047 We've arranged over $800 million of longer-term refocus over these for our credit assets and we executed $374 million of convertible debt, which further diversifies our liability and capital structure. \u2047 While pricing is never ideal in a crisis, we are heartened to be able to access the capital markets. \u2047 Looking forward, it's hard to have a clear view on how the U.S. economy is going to perform as it starts back up. \u2047 We are in uncharted waters with regard to the high unemployment and severe changes in social habits. \u2047 We would love to believe that we'll be back to a V-shape recovery, but it's most likely going to take longer and be difficult to get back to where we were in February. \u2047 The mortgage and housing market outlook will also be challenging in the very near term. \u2047 Mortgage forbearance stays at a high degree of uncertainty to mortgage credit and we will be cautious until we have more clarity on the forbearance duration and the totals in our portfolio. \u2047 Given all these complexities, earnings for the next few quarters will be difficult to predict until the economic conditions clarify. \u2047 We remain focused on maintaining liquidity, extending our financing terms, and keeping our credit portfolio intact. \u2047 We are navigating through a very turbulent period but we are very hopeful that the U.S. economy will recover and the mortgage market will return to more normal footing when the economy restarts and people get back to work. \u2047 The first quarter of 2020 was an extremely volatile period in the U.S. fixed income market. \u2047 The 10-year treasury note began the year at 1.92% and fell 125 basis points to end the first quarter with a yield of 0.67%. \u2047 The Federal Reserve cut its overnight lending rate by 150 basis points over a two-week period as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 The large drop in interest rates, sharp increase in rate volatility and investor flight to quality had a large imbalance of funds across most fixed income products. \u2047 Investors that utilized leverage were forced to sell their securities at low prices to meet margin calls on existing repo transactions. \u2047 Chimera was not immune. \u2047 In the first quarter, we utilized the combination of cash balances, unpledged[Phonetic] securities and outright sales of our agency assets as part of our overall liquidity management strategy. \u2047 Chimera has successfully met all margin calls to date. \u2047 Chimera's swift[Phonetic] funding strategy is multifaceted. \u2047 The primary objective has been and continues to be utilizing securitization to create long term funding for our credit assets. \u2047 At the end of the first quarter, we had nearly $8.5 billion of securitized debt outstanding. \u2047 Secondarily, we use repo financing on our retained assets, legacy non-agency securities, and loans. \u2047 We typically use longer repo maturity dates when financing these assets, which enables more effective counterparty and portfolio management. \u2047 And post quarter end, we added two new long term credit financing facilities totaling $800 million. \u2047 These facilities contain attractive features including a significant reduction of daily mark-to-market risk on our credit assets. \u2047 We successfully continued our loan securitization strategy this quarter and in March, we priced two deals with season reperforming loans from our warehouse. \u2047 CIM 2020-R1 has $391 million underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 5% and a weighted average loan age of 158 months. \u2047 The average loan size in the R1 securitization was $123,000 and had an average FICO score of 613. \u2047 We sold $312 million senior securities with a 2.35% cost of debt. \u2047 Chimera retained a March 2023 calendar call option on the R1 securitization. \u2047 In addition, we securitized CIM 2020-R2, which had a $492 million underlying loans with a weighted average coupon of 3.79% and a weighted average loan age of 161 months. \u2047 The average loan size in the R2 deal was $219,000 and had an average FICO of 690. \u2047 We sold $352 million senior securities with a 2.55% cost of debt. \u2047 In response to the significant drop in interest rates, increased price volatility and repo margin calls, this quarter, we sold our entire portfolio of $5.7 billion residential agency pass-throughs. \u2047 These pass-throughs were the most liquid and lowest yielding assets in our portfolio and have always been part of our strategy to meet our liquidity needs. \u2047 We also terminated all our agency hedge positions comprised of U.S. Treasury note futures and $4.1 billion notional balance on interest rate swaps. \u2047 The agency CMBS portfolio, which has taken us many years to accumulate, was retained. \u2047 As of the quarter end, this portfolio totaled $2.5 billion. \u2047 We continue to like the spread income generated by this portfolio and the superior convexity profile of Ginnie Mae project loans relative to residential agency pass-throughs. \u2047 These securities finance well in the repo markets and have some more rates and haircuts as traditional agency pass-throughs. \u2047 The unique[Indecipherable] explicit prepayment lockout and penalties are valuable security trades as interest rates fall. \u2047 After quarter end, spreads on agency CMBS began to tighten when the Fed began purchasing these assets as part of their quantitative easing program. \u2047 Portfolio activity this quarter has significantly reduced the company's risk exposure as measured by recourse leverage. \u2047 We ended the quarter at 2.2 times recourse leverage down from 3.4 times at year-end and 3.8 times at the end of the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 This represents a 35% reduction of recourse leverage over the last three months and 42% over the past six months. \u2047 It is important to note, due to current market conditions, our high-yield credit assets, which is the largest component of our portfolio, have been marked down in book value -- have been marked down in value, which has contributed to Chimera's lower book value this quarter. \u2047 Our ability to retain this portfolio enables the opportunity for security value increases over time as economy restarts and the country works its way through the current pandemic. \u2047 As we move forward to the current economic crisis, we remain cautiously optimistic. \u2047 We will continue to space out the repo maturities and seek longer tenure for our credit repo. \u2047 And as we get more visibility into the housing and mortgage economics resulting from the crisis, we will seek to deploy cash into new investment opportunities as we have for the past decade. \u2047 I'll review Chimera's financial highlights for the first quarter. \u2047 GAAP book value at the end of the first quarter was $12.45 per share. \u2047 Our GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $389 million or $2.08 per share. \u2047 On a core basis, net income for the first quarter was $106 million or $0.57 per share. \u2047 Economic net interest income for the first quarter was $151 million. \u2047 For the first quarter, the yield on average interest earning assets was 5.3%. \u2047 Our average cost of funds was 3% and our net interest spread was 2.3%. \u2047 Total leverage for the first quarter was 4.7 to 1, while recourse leverage ended the quarter at 2.2 to 1. \u2047 Expenses for the first quarter, excluding servicing fees and transaction expenses were $18.6 million, consistent with last quarter. \u2047 Given the current market environment, we wanted to provide additional information about liquidity. \u2047 We currently have approximately $650 million in cash and unencumbered assets. \u2047 This is after we paid both our preferred and common stock dividends totaling $111 million. \u2047 Also, in April, we closed a public convertible bond offering that raised $374 million. \u2047 We believe it's important to have ample liquidity in this market and we're happy that the capital markets were open for us to achieve this goal. \u2047 We will continue to monitor our liquidity and assess opportunities to increase liquidity and balance, supporting our current portfolio and finding new opportunities in the market. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1
