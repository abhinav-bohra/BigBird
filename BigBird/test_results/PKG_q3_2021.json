{"article": ["I'm Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President and Head of Medtronic Investor Relations. \u2047 Joining me are Geoff Martha, Medtronic's, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 29th, 2021, and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. \u2047 Today's event should last about an hour. \u2047 Unless we say otherwise, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis. \u2047 Second quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency, as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last four quarters that had a significant impact on total Company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. \u2047 References to sequential revenue changes compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22 and are made on an as reported basis. \u2047 And all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2021 compared to the third calendar quarter of 2020 unless otherwise stated. \u2047 And finally, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. \u2047 With that, let's head into the studio and get started. \u2047 Obviously, our end markets were impacted by the COVID-19 resurgence and the healthcare system staffing shortages, particularly in the US, which affected our quarterly revenue growth. \u2047 Procedure volumes were lighter than expected in markets, where our technology is used in more deferrable procedures like our spine business or those that require ICU bed capacity like TAVR. \u2047 Yet in markets, where procedures are less deferrable like pacing, we experienced stronger growth. \u2047 While the US market was a headwind, many of our international markets were much stronger. \u2047 We delivered 6% revenue growth outside the US, including mid teens growth in emerging markets. \u2047 And our emerging market growth is up 9% versus pre-pandemic levels in Q2 fiscal '20. \u2047 In the midst of these market headwinds, we focused on managing what was in our control and executed to advance our pipeline, launched new products and win share. \u2047 And when you look at our sequential revenue performance, our 2% decline was slightly better than most of our large cap medtech competitors. \u2047 While the pace of the recovery from pandemic headwinds is hard to predict, our markets will recover, and as that happens, Medtronic is one of the best-positioned companies in healthcare. \u2047 The underlying health of our business is strong,and it's getting stronger. \u2047 We have an expansive pipeline of leading technology, a robust balance sheet and an expanding roster of proven top talent. \u2047 Coupled with our revitalized operating model and new competitive mindset, we remain poised to accelerate and sustain growth. \u2047 As I've done in prior quarters, let's start with a look at our market share performance. \u2047 Year-over-year market share is an important metric that our teams are evaluated against in their annual incentive plans, along with revenue growth, profit and free cash flow. \u2047 And right now, the majority of our businesses are winning share, driven by our innovation and increased competitiveness. \u2047 And this is exactly the sort of market share performance that gives us confidence in the deep strength of our businesses. \u2047 And to avoid any confusion about how we're performing when we talk about our share dynamics, we'll refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter to keep it directly comparable to our competition. \u2047 Share momentum in our three largest businesses continued. \u2047 In the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, we extended category leadership, adding over a point of share year-over-year, driven by our differentiated Micra family of pacemakers, Cobalt and Crome high power devices and our TYRX antibacterial envelopes. \u2047 In surgical innovations, we outperform competition with strong performances in endo stapling and sutures, and our Signia powered stapling system, and Tri-Staple technology continues to see great market adoption. \u2047 In Cranial & Spinal Technologies, we're winning share and launching new spine implants that enhance the overall value of our ecosystem of preoperative planning software, imaging, navigation and robotic systems, and powered surgical instruments, which is transforming care in spine surgery. \u2047 Our new implants also go directly at the competition. \u2047 Starting this past quarter with our Catalyft expandable interbodies to specifically attract Globus users. \u2047 In addition to our three largest, a broad array of our other businesses have increased their competitiveness, are launching new products and winning share in their end markets. \u2047 So for example in patient monitoring, we're winning share with our Nellcor pulse oximetry sensors and our monitors. \u2047 In respiratory interventions, we picked up four points of share in premium ventilation, due to our ability to respond quickly to spikes in demand from COVID resurgence. \u2047 And in neuromodulation, we won share across our product lines, including pain stim and DBS, as we continue to launch new products. \u2047 In pain stim despite the sequential slowdown in the market, we're gaining share with our Intellis with DTM technology and our Vanta recharge-free system. \u2047 In DBS, we had a very strong quarter, winning over six points of share. \u2047 We're executing on the launch of our Percept neurostimulator with brain sense technology paired with our SenSight Directional Lead, and we continue to be the only company with sensing capabilities. \u2047 Since launching SenSight in the US earlier this fiscal year, we surged ahead of the competition in new implant share. \u2047 Sensing has redefined what it takes to compete in DBS. \u2047 Our competitors don't have it, and as a result, we're expecting a long runway of share gains, as we build upon our category leadership. \u2047 Now, while the majority of our businesses are winning share, we do have a few businesses that are flat or losing share, and we're focusing our efforts and our investments to grow above the market. \u2047 In cardiac diagnostics, we're focused on improving supply to reverse share declines, and we're investing in new indications and novel AI detection algorithms to expand the market and drive growth. \u2047 In cardiac ablation solutions, we expect to win share, as we expand the rollout of our DiamondTemp RF Ablation System and drive awareness and adoption of our Arctic Front Advance Pro cryoablation, as a first line treatment for paroxysmal AF. \u2047 In diabetes, while we lost share again this quarter, we remain pleased with the momentum we're building outside the US, not only with the 780G insulin pumps, but also with the positive customers' feedback we've heard on our extended infusion set and fingerstick free Guardian Sensor 4. \u2047 And we expect our US results to turnaround, as we launch these new products. \u2047 Next, let's turn to our product pipeline. \u2047 I've already talked about the impact, our strong flow of new products is having in the market. \u2047 We've launched over 180 products in the US, Western Europe, Japan, and China in the last 12 months. \u2047 At the same time, we continue to advance new technologies that are in development. \u2047 We're heavily investing in this pipeline with a targeted R&D spend of over $2.7 billion this fiscal year, which is an increase of over 10%, the largest dollar increase in our history. \u2047 We're expecting these investments to create new markets, disrupt existing ones and accelerate the growth profile of Medtronic. \u2047 Let's start with our Symplicity Renal Denervation procedure for hypertension. \u2047 While we weren't able to end our ON MED study early, we remain confident in our program, in our ability to serve the millions of patients, who make up this multi-billion dollar opportunity. \u2047 As a reminder, our previous three sham-controlled simplicity studies, all reached statistical significance, including the pivotal OFF MED study. \u2047 And the ON MED study remains powered to detect a statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit at the final analysis. \u2047 We expect that ON MED follow-up will complete in the second half of next calendar year, and then, we'll submit the PMA to the US FDA for approval. \u2047 When we think about renal denervation, let's start with the patients, who have indicated that they want options like the simplicity blood pressure-lowering procedure to treat their hypertension, as confirmed by our patient preference study presented earlier this month at TCT. \u2047 We believe demand will be high and we continue to expect this to be a massive opportunity that we will lead. \u2047 Another opportunity for Medtronic is surgical robotics, where we are entering the soft tissue robotics market, as a second meaningful player. \u2047 We achieved a major milestone when we received CE Mark for Hugo last month, and we also completed our first procedures with Hugo in our Asia-Pacific region at Apollo Hospitals in India. \u2047 The first surgeons to use Hugo in the clinical setting have told us they believe Hugo addresses the cost and utilization barriers that have held back the growth of robotic surgery. \u2047 Look, demand is high, and we're building a long list of hospitals that want to join our partners and possibility program and be among the first in the world to use Hugo and participate in our global registry, which will collect clinical data to support regulatory submissions around the world. \u2047 Our robotic program is making progress toward a broader launch, and we remain well-positioned in this critical field relative to every other potential new entrant. \u2047 As we prepare for this broader launch, we're working hard to ensure an outstanding customer experience. \u2047 We're also focused on optimizing our supply chain, manufacturing and logistics to prepare for scaling this business. \u2047 We're making steady progress on these activities, but not at the pace that we had originally planned. \u2047 And as a result sales this fiscal year are likely to come in below our $50 million to $100 million target. \u2047 Now, that said, we still expect double digit millions in sales this fiscal year, and we continue to expect a strong ramp in FY '23. \u2047 We're off schedule, but we're not off track. \u2047 And while we're disappointed in the revenue push out for this important program, we're confident that we have line of sight to the solutions we need to be successful and to optimize the customer experience. \u2047 Demand remains high, surgeons continue to do cases, our order pipeline continues to build, and we're looking forward to starting our US IDE soon. \u2047 We remain confident in the success of this program, and we believe that we're poised to meaningfully expand the soft tissue robotic market and drive growth for years to come. \u2047 In Cardiac Rhythm, we just launched our Micra AV leadless pacemaker in Japan earlier this month. \u2047 We also completed the US pivotal study enrollment for our EV ICD, which follows our CE Mark submission in Q1. \u2047 Just as we disrupted the pacing market with Micra, we intend to do the same in the implantable defibrillator space with our EV ICD. \u2047 Our device can both pace and shock without any leads inside the heart and veins, and it does this in a single device that is the same size, as a traditional ICD. \u2047 In structural heart, we're starting the limited US launch of our next-gen TAVR system, the Evolut FX this month with a full market launch planned for fiscal Q4. \u2047 Evolut FX enhances ease of use with improvements and deliverability, implant visibility and deployment stability. \u2047 We're also making progress on our transcatheter mitral program. \u2047 At TCT earlier this month, we presented very encouraging early data of our transfemoral delivery system for our intrepid mitral valve, and we will be rolling that system into our APOLLO pivotal trial. \u2047 In diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump combined with our Guardian 4 sensor continue to be under active review with the FDA. \u2047 When approved and launched in the US, we expect the 780G system to drive growth, as it will be highly differentiated and further address the burden of daily diabetes management. \u2047 And for the first time ever, is helping hard to manage pediatric and adolescent patients achieve outcomes mirroring well-controlled adults. \u2047 The user experience has also improved markedly, and these outstanding results were achieved with our 780G paired with our Guardian 3 sensor. \u2047 So we expect the experience will be even stronger with Guardian 4. \u2047 And the value of our offering will be further enhanced when we bring our Synergy sensor, which is now called Simplera[Phonetic] to market. \u2047 It's easier to apply and half the size of Guardian 4, and we expect to submit it to FDA later this fiscal year. \u2047 In pelvic health, we're awaiting FDA approval for our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device, which we expect in the first half of next calendar year. \u2047 With its best-in-class battery, constant current, and full-body MRI compatibility at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla, we expect this device will extend our category leadership in this space. \u2047 In neuromodulation, we recently submitted our ECAPs closed-loop spinal cord stimulator to the FDA. \u2047 We're calling this device Inceptiv SCS, and we expect it to revolutionize SCS with closed-loop therapy to optimize pain relief for patients. \u2047 We also continue to make progress on expanding indications for SCS into non-surgical refractory back pain, painful diabetic neuropathy and upper limb and neck chronic pain. \u2047 Finally in DBS, we continue to enroll patients in our ADAPT-PD trial studying our closed-loop adaptive DBS therapy in patients with Parkinson's. \u2047 We're expecting enrollment in the trial to complete later this fiscal year. \u2047 Medtronic is advancing a pipeline of meaningful innovation that we believe will not only enhance our competitiveness, but will accelerate our total Company growth going forward. \u2047 Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2%, reflecting the market impact of COVID and health system staffing shortages on procedure volumes, primarily in the United States. \u2047 Despite the softer end markets, our team executed to deliver strong margin improvement and earnings growth. \u2047 In fact, our adjusted earnings per share increased 29% significant growth, reflecting the pandemic impact last year, and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.03 better than consensus with $0.02 from stronger operating profit and a penny[Phonetic] from a lower than expected tax rate. \u2047 Our second quarter revenue growth came in lower than we were expecting back in August. \u2047 We did see improving trends in our average daily sales each month of the quarter, as COVID hospitalizations declined. \u2047 That said, the bounce back in the US wasn't as fast as we had expected or had seen in prior waves. \u2047 We've recognized many of our customers are dealing with staffing shortages on top of increased COVID"], "gold_summary": ["reaffirms fy non-gaap earnings per share view $5.65 to $5.75
