{"article": ["In the supplemental package, the company has reconciled on non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investors. \u2047 During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President and our regional management teams will be available to address questions. \u2047 I'm delighted to report that for the first time since the pandemic, I'm together with Doug, Mike, Sara and our Boston Team for this earnings call and all BXP employees returned to the office on July 6th. \u2047 BXP is emerging from the pandemic with strength and momentum as evidenced by improving financial results and rapidly elevating leasing and investment activity. \u2047 So, the US economy awash with fiscal and monetary stimulus is roaring back as we exit the pandemic. \u2047 US GDP growth was 6.4% in the first quarter and predicted to be higher for the second quarter and for all of 2021. \u2047 Over 850,000 jobs were created in June and aggregate unemployment decreased to 5.9%. \u2047 Industries that use offices have been less impacted by the pandemic and the employment rate for their workers is lower. \u2047 Despite the annual inflation rate rising to 5.4% in June, the 10-year US treasury rate has dropped to around 1.3% and the Federal Reserve's rhetoric remains distinctly dovish given it believes the recent inflation is driven by transitory factors. \u2047 High economic growth and low interest rates create the ideal environment for strong real estate investment performance. \u2047 Now, BXP's financial results for the second quarter reflect the impacts of this recovery and an increasingly favorable economic environment. \u2047 Our FFO per share this quarter was $0.10 above market consensus and $0.12 above our own forecast, which Mike will detail shortly. \u2047 We completed 1.2 million square feet of leasing, more than double the volume we achieved in the first quarter and only 10% below our long-term second quarter averages. \u2047 Our clients are making long-term commitments. \u2047 The leases signed in the second quarter had a weighted average term of 7.5 years, many are expanding, as was the case with 2 large media and tech clients in LA and building quality is increasingly important as evidenced by strong tour and leasing activity at the GM Building, Reston Town Center, Colorado Center and the view floors at Embarcadero Center. \u2047 We believe this activity and performance supports our repeatedly stated position that tenants are committed to the office as their location of choice to collaborate, innovate, and train all critical for their long-term success and that concerns about the work from anywhere impact on the BXP footprint are overstated. \u2047 Moving to private equity market conditions, $15.7 billion of significant office assets were sold in the second quarter flat to last quarter of 77% from the second quarter a year ago and down approximately 44% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels, and it remains 23% of commercial real estate transaction activity. \u2047 Cap rates are arguably declining for assets with limited lease rollover and anything life science related given lower interest rates. \u2047 Notably, in Cambridge this last quarter a REIT agreed to purchase Charles Park vacant though with identified tenants for $815 million or $2200 a square foot. \u2047 Also, One Memorial Drive in Cambridge, a fully leased 409,000 square feet office asset is under agreement to sell for $825 million or over $2000 a square foot, and a 3.8% initial cap rate. \u2047 Moving to BXP's capital market activity, we had a very active and successful quarter with acquisitions. \u2047 All of the investment strategies we have described to you over the last several quarters are represented in the 4 new investments we recently announced, which aggregate almost 2 million square feet. \u2047 These strategies are growing life sciences, enter the Seattle market, acquire high quality assets that need redevelopment or refreshment at discounted valuations due to the pandemic and acquire office assets in partnership with private equity investors through a joint venture investment program we set up with GIC and CPP, two leading global real estate investors. \u2047 So let's start with our official entry into the Seattle region with the acquisition of Safeco Plaza We have previously discussed the Seattle area as having a strong real estate market, as well as a logical expansion region for BXP's gateway strategy. \u2047 The Puget Sound region is the headquarters location for leading global employers like Amazon and Microsoft and has one of the largest clusters of computer science workers in the US. \u2047 Seattle has experienced high levels of population and rent growth given its expanding technology and life science employment base and is much more affordable than other major technology markets given those State of Washington income taxes and lower real estate costs for both office space and housing. \u2047 Rents, land values and building value lower in Seattle than any of our other core gateway markets. \u2047 The broader Puget Sound market has the scale and growth potential to afford us opportunities to both acquire and develop in multiple districts of Seattle, Bellevue and other eastside markets. \u2047 We have an attractive pipeline of additional investment opportunities currently under review and we'll build out a full service real estate execution team over time. \u2047 Safeco Plaza comprises 800,000 square feet, has a LEED Platinum certification and is located in the center of the Seattle CBD with convenient access to rail, ferry and highway transit options. \u2047 The building is currently 90% leased with 6 years of weighted average lease term at rents that are approximately 30% below market. \u2047 Safeco Plaza offers generous ceiling heights 360-degree views and timeless architectural features and our strategy is to refresh the ground plane lobby and amenities and release the building at market rates in the coming years. \u2047 Liberty Mutual which acquired Safeco is the anchor tenant leasing 68% of the build. \u2047 BXP will own either 51% or 33.3% of the property, depending on whether one or two private equity investors join the partnership. \u2047 We believe our basis in the acquisition, which is $465 million or $581 a square foot is very favorable relative to replacement cost and recent office trading activity in the Seattle market. \u2047 We believe Safeco Plaza to be a very attractive investment opportunity with a future redevelopment play given the quality and location of the building our going in basis as well as the cash flow we receive from existing tenants during the refreshment process. \u2047 We have a non-refundable deposit posted and intend to close the acquisition in early September. \u2047 We are also entering a new sub-market for BXP, Midtown South in New York City with the acquisition of 360 Park Avenue South. \u2047 Midtown South has become New York's strongest submarket in terms of rent growth and vacancy given it is the preferred location for many technology occupiers, New York City's most rapidly growing business segment. \u2047 360 Park Avenue South comprises 450,000 square feet and is in a prime location at the corner of 26th street, one block from Madison Square Park. \u2047 The transaction will close and the building will be vacated by a long-term corporate user later this year, which provides us the opportunity to plan in advance and subsequently execute a complete refreshment of the building. \u2047 With generous ceiling heights and a unique elevator configuration allowing for 2 separate dedicated lobbies, we believe the building will appeal to both large and medium sized users seeking marketing and brand expression opportunities with their space. \u2047 In terms of economics, we are paying $300 million for the building or $667 a square foot, which leaves us significant latitude relative to comparable sales to budget generous building enhancements. \u2047 The acquisition structure is also creative and we think favorable for BXP. \u2047 Consideration for the purchase will be the assumption of a $202 million mortgage on the property and the issuance of $98 million of OP units and BXP's Operating Partnership. \u2047 We are committed to complete the transaction on December 1st of this year and the number of OP units issued at closing will be determined by BXP stock price at that time but with a floor of $111 a share. \u2047 In other words, we would benefit by issuing fewer units if our share price continues to rise through the closing date but our downside is capped by a floor. \u2047 Most importantly, the tax deferral inherent in our contribution structure distinguished our proposal such that it did not have to be the highest price to yield the seller the highest after tax value. \u2047 One of our joint venture investment program partners will likely join this investment by funding all of the capital needed for the refreshment resulting in their owning up to a 50% interest in the project over time. \u2047 Next on acquisitions, we added to our life science business and entered the Montgomery County, Maryland life science market through the acquisition of a seven building 435,000 square feet office park located in close proximity to the Shady Grove Life Sciences Center, the premier cluster for life sciences in the Washington DC region. \u2047 Montgomery County is the 4th largest life science market in the US and home or proximate to several large biomedical institutions such as NIH, FDA, John Hopkins University, and the University of Maryland. \u2047 The 4 million square foot Shady Grove sub-market at the epicenter is currently 3% vacant with rising rents. \u2047 We are paying a $116.5 million for the asset or $267 a square foot and intend to convert the entire park to lab and life science use over time. \u2047 There are 7 buildings in total 3 of which are vacant and will be converted to lab immediately. \u2047 The remaining 4 buildings are 63% leased and will be converted to lab use as leases expire and office tenants vacate over the next few years. \u2047 The entire site is 31 acres and can accommodate additional ground-up development depending on demand. \u2047 There is a strong backlog of space requirements in the market and we are already competing for a large build-to-suit in addition to other requirements. \u2047 We have a non-refundable deposit posted and plan to close the acquisition in August. \u2047 And lastly, in the second quarter, we completed another life science acquisition 153 and 211 Second Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts. \u2047 These two existing lab buildings comprising 154,000 square feet and a 100% leased to Sanofi are located immediately adjacent to our 200 West Street lab conversion property, which is almost complete and expected to deliver in the 4th quarter of this year. \u2047 This was an off-market transaction completed at a price of $100 million or $650 a square foot, and a 6.4% initial cap rate. \u2047 Sanofi's lease is short term and below market. \u2047 The site comprises 14 acres and has 120,000 square feet of additional development rights, which could be increased when combined with the excess development capacity of our adjacent 200 West Street site. \u2047 Life sciences is a rapidly growing segment of our overall business. \u2047 Today, life sciences at BXP is 3 million square feet, representing 6.4% of our total revenue. \u2047 We have 920,000 square feet of lab redevelopment and development projects currently underway that are experiencing strong user demand and expected to deliver in the next 36 months. \u2047 And we have approximately 5.5 million square feet of future conversion and development opportunities under our control in the Cambridge, Waltham, Lexington, South San Francisco and now Montgomery County markets. \u2047 Within 5 years, assuming continued strong market conditions, we could more than double the amount of BXP's revenue that is generated from the Life Science sector. \u2047 Regarding dispositions, we have an agreement to sell our Spring Street office park in Lexington, Mass for $192 million or $575 a square foot. \u2047 We expect the sale to close in September as part of an exchange with the two life science acquisitions mentioned previously. \u2047 Year-to-date, we have completed or committed to dispositions aggregating $225 million in our share of gross proceeds and are considering additional asset sales in 2021. \u2047 And as a reminder on investment activities though we did not add to or deliver from our active development pipeline this quarter, we have 4.3 million square feet of development underway that is 71% pre-leased and projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI and 3.7% to our annual NOI growth over the next 3 years. \u2047 On a final an important personnel note, John Powers who as you know, is the head of our New York region told us he would like to retire at the end of this year. \u2047 We conducted a thorough external and internal search and are very excited to have Hilary Spann join BXP as an Executive Vice President. \u2047 Hilary has many years of real estate management and investment experience as a senior officer of CPP and prior at JPMorgan Investment Management Having completed $12 billion in investments in New York City alone. \u2047 Hilary will join BXP after Labor Day and commence her duties as New York Regional Manager at the beginning of 2022. \u2047 So in summary, we had a very active and successful second quarter with strong financial results and multiple new business wins in the leasing and investment market. \u2047 BXP has a strong growth ramp driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, the recovery of our variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion now of 4 new acquisitions, a strong balance sheet and capital allocated from large scale private equity partners to pursue new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets as well as low interest rates and decreasing capital costs. \u2047 Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation for the BXP team which is back at the office, serving our clients, and winning new mandates with great care, expertise, and enthusiasm. \u2047 Obviously, we have a lot to talk about on the transactional side, I'm sure, there'll be some questions on that, but I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the leasing markets and the activity that we're seeing. \u2047 There is certainly no question that we're on the precipice of significant change in the atmosphere around in person work but more announcements come out every day, the fact remains there is still some uncertainty and there is some trepidation about COVID-19 the delta variant and whatever the next thing is going to be. \u2047 So the transition period that we are now in as many organizations like ours encourage or require their employees to come back to work, it's going to take some time. \u2047 So they're going to be some ramifications of that. \u2047 The impacts on space needs are going to really vary depending upon the size of organizations which we would like to put in 3 categories. \u2047 So the first are the really large employers. \u2047 And honestly, they are moving forward with plans for space, based on long-term growth plans hiring that's occurred over the last 16 months, and thousands of open job requirements that they are trying to fill right now. \u2047 Then, you have really small organizations that are very stable and they've all recognized that, very little is going to change regarding how they utilize a real estate, maybe some will work more from outside the office but"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports earnings per share of $0.71 and ffo per share of $1.72.  \u2047  compname reports earnings per share of $0.71 and ffo per share of $1.72.  \u2047  q2
