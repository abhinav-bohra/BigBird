{"article": ["This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations. \u2047 [Operator Instructions] We'll begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO. \u2047 During our remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 These include information in constant currency, as well as adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted leverage ratio that exclude the impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, and for 2019, the net non-recurring benefit associated with the U.S. Tax Act. \u2047 As a reminder, we completed a 2-for-1 stock split at the end of our fiscal 2020. \u2047 It is important to note, these statements include expectations and assumptions, which will be shared related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Lawrence. \u2047 Starting on Slide 4, our fourth quarter results completed a year of strong financial performance. \u2047 We delivered strong results in 2020 despite great disruption proving the strength of our business model, the value of our product, our capabilities as a company, as well as the successful execution of our strategy. \u2047 I am incredibly proud of the way McCormick has performed in this unprecedented operating environment. \u2047 We drove outstanding underlying operating performance while protecting our employees in recognizing their exceptional performance, making important investments in our supply chain and brand building to fuel future growth and supporting our communities through relief efforts. \u2047 We're also excited about the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, two fantastic businesses that will continue to support differentiated growth and performance, positioning McCormick for success in 2021 and beyond. \u2047 As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. \u2047 The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings it's a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance during volatile time, as evidenced by our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. \u2047 The sustained shift at consumer behavior to cooking and eating more at home or at-home consumption drove substantial increases in our Consumer segment demand, as well as increases with our packaged food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. \u2047 On the other hand, we experienced declines in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers in the away from home products in our portfolio. \u2047 The impact of this shift to more at-home consumption has varied by region due to differing levels of away from home consumption in each, as well as the pace of each regions' COVID-19 recovery. \u2047 Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering. \u2047 Heading into 2021, I'm confident our operating momentum will continue. \u2047 In our 2021 outlook, our continued underlying business momentum and the Cholula and FONA acquisitions are expected to drive robust sales, adjusted operating income, and earnings growth and fund our investments in business transformation. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6, starting with the fourth quarter results, which were in line with the guidance we provided for sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted earnings per share on our last earnings call on our top line versus the year ago period, we grew total sales 5%, including a 1% favorable impact from currency. \u2047 In constant currency, we grew total sales 4%, with both segments contributing to the increase. \u2047 Adjusted operating income declined 4%, as growth from higher sales and CCI-led cost savings were more than offset by higher planned brand marketing investments, COVID-19-related costs, and higher employee benefit expenses. \u2047 Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.79 compared to $0.81 in the prior year, driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income for the partial offset from lower interest expense. \u2047 Turning to our fourth quarter segment business performance, starting on Slide 7 in our Consumer segment, we grew fourth quarter sales by 6%, or constant currency 5% driven by consumers cooking and eating more at home. \u2047 Our Americas constant currency sales growth was 6% in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our total McCormick U.S.-branded portfolio, as indicated in our IRI consumption data, grew 14% which reflects the strength of our categories as consumers continue to cook more at home. \u2047 Similar to previous quarters, our sales increase was lower than the U.S. IRI consumption growth, which is attributable to service level pressures and an increased level of pricing in scanner data. \u2047 As mentioned in our earnings call at the end of September, we expected service level pressures in the fourth quarter due to the sustained increase in demand. \u2047 To protect our top selling holiday items, we had to suspend or curtail production on some secondary product, which importantly drove our strong holiday execution, and consistent with previous quarters, scanner data includes higher pricing growth due to the channel shift with grocery outpacing mass merchandisers and closed stores, as well as some impact from lower promotional activity. \u2047 Focusing on the U.S. branded portfolio in spices and seasonings and other key categories, excluding dry recipe mixes, we grew fourth quarter consumption at double-digit rate and again, increased our household penetration and repeat buy rates. \u2047 Our fourth quarter dry recipe mix consumption was impacted by supply constraint this has double-digit growth for the year, as with spices and seasonings and the other key categories. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we continue to gain share in categories less impacted by supply constraints, including hot sauces, stocks and broth, barbecue sauce, wet marinate, and Asian products. \u2047 The majority of our categories, continue to outpace the total store and center of store growth rates favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well, such as Stubb's, Lawry's, Simply Asia and Thai Kitchen. \u2047 And in e-commerce, we had triple-digit pure-play growth with McCormick branded consumption outpacing all major categories. \u2047 While we do not expect consumption to continue at the highly elevated level of our fourth quarter, we do expect continued and long-lasting growth from the increase in consumers cooking more at home the most recent IRI scanner sales data for the five-weeks ending January 17th show total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption is still growing at approximately 11.5% with continued strength in spices and seasonings. \u2047 Consumers are continuing to come to our brand, have a good experience and buy our products again. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we increased our brand marketing investments in all regions, as planned, with the Americas messaging and promotional activities focused on a holiday proving to be successful. \u2047 With our high level of effective brand marketing investments and our initiatives to deepen our digital engagement with consumers we're capitalizing on the opportunity to build long-term brand equity, capture trial and increased usage by existing consumers. \u2047 And with the manufacturing capacity we've recently added, we're well-positioned moving into 2021, and we'll continue to drive growth with strong brand marketing, category management initiatives and new product innovations. \u2047 Now turning to EMEA, our constant currency sales rose 10% in the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across the region. \u2047 Our largest markets continue to drive double-digit total branded consumption growth with market share gains across the region at several categories. \u2047 Spices and seasonings consumption was strong in all markets and our Vahine brand in France again had strong consumption growth and outpaced the homemade desserts category. \u2047 Aand in U.K., Frank's RedHot drove the hot sauce category growth and gained share with over 50% consumption growth. \u2047 In EMEA, our household penetration and rate of repeat buyers increased significantly across our major brands and markets during the fourth quarter and the full year compared to last year. \u2047 Importantly, for the full year, we gained total EMEA region's market share in spices and seasonings and dry recipe mixes. \u2047 In the Asia-Pacific region, our constant currency sales declined 10% driven by softness in branded foodservice products, which are included in our Consumer segment in this region. \u2047 The foodservice industry is continuing to recover, but at a gradual pace. \u2047 Growth in China was also impacted by a shift to a later Chinese New Year in 2021, which in turn impacted shipments at the end of our year. \u2047 Excluding those impacts, consumer consumption in the region was strong, particularly at Gourmet Garden and Frank's RedHot in Australia. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8, our sales performance in Flavor Solutions return to growth in the fourth quarter with a constant currency sales increase of 3% and all three regions contributed to the sales growth. \u2047 In both our Americas and EMEA regions, we experienced increased demand from our consumer packaged food customers or at-home customer base with the strength in the base business, as well as momentum with new products. \u2047 Also in both regions, we experienced demand declines in our away from home customer base for branded foodservice and restaurant customers. \u2047 The net impact of this demand volatility, along with pricing actions to cover cost increases drove EMEA's fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 5% and then the Americas, which is more skewed to branded foodservice growth of 2%. \u2047 In the Asia-Pacific region our constant currency sales grew 7% driven by Australia and China's growth with quick service restaurant for QSR customers, but we continue to see momentum at limited time offers and the core business partially driven by the customers' promotional activities. \u2047 Moving from our fourth quarter results, I'm pleased to share our full fiscal year accomplishments. \u2047 It's not only highlight what we've achieved during 2020, but fuel our confidence to drive another year of strong operating performance in 2021. \u2047 Now starting with our 2020 financial results as seen on Slide 9, we grow 5% constant currency sales growth with 10% growth in our Consumer segment led by consumers cooking and eating more at home. \u2047 Partially offsetting this growth was a 2% constant currency sales decline in the Flavor Solutions segment as COVID-19 restrictions in most markets, as well as consumer reluctance to dine out, reduced demand from restaurant and other foodservice customer. \u2047 We achieved $113 million of annual cost savings driven by our CCI program, our fuel for growth and there continues to be a long runway in 2021 and beyond to deliver additional cost savings. \u2047 2020 was the ninth consecutive year with record cash flow from operations ending the year at over $1 billion, a 10% increase from last year. \u2047 We're making great progress with our working capital improvements. \u2047 At year-end, our Board of Directors announced a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend marking our 35th consecutive year of dividend increases. \u2047 We have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat. \u2047 Now I would like to comment on some of our 2020 achievements beyond our financial performance. \u2047 E-commerce growth accelerated significantly in 2020, which we were well prepared for from our past investments and investments we activated early in the year. \u2047 Our 2020 growth of 136% was outstanding, with triple-digit growth in all categories, including pure-play, click and collect and our own direct-to-consumer properties. \u2047 We expect the consumer shift increased online shopping to continue and we are well-positioned for the opportunities still ahead. \u2047 We continue to build long-term brand equity through our brand marketing investments, increasing at 7% in fiscal 2020. \u2047 Most recently, with a double-digit increase in the fourth quarter across all regions, which will continue to drive strong growth momentum into 2021. \u2047 We designed targeted media and messaging focused on cooking at home and connecting with consumers digitally more than ever in 2020. \u2047 Our digital leadership was again recognized, as we were ranked as the number 1 food brand with the highest designation of genius by Gartner L2 research in their Digital IQ U.S. ranking. \u2047 This is the seventh year in a row, we were ranked in the top five food and beverage brands. \u2047 We continue to be recognized for our efforts for doing what's right for people, communities and the planet. \u2047 During 2020, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year, as a DiversityInc Top 50 company. \u2047 And earlier this week, Corporate Knights ranked McCormick in their 2021 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations Index, as a number 1 in the food products industry for the 5th consecutive year, as well as the number 1 U.S. company overall and globally number 6 overall. \u2047 Finally, during the year, we continue to invest to expand our global infrastructure. \u2047 In the Americas, we broke ground on a new state-of-the-art Northeast Distribution Center in Maryland, which will optimize our distribution network. \u2047 In our EMEA region, we began construction on the new Flavor Solutions' manufacturing facility in the U.K. to support the region's strong and growing customer base. \u2047 In China, we are investing in flavor capabilities to further drive Flavor solutions' growth. \u2047 These investments will create both capacity and capability, which will further drive our growth momentum. \u2047 Turning to 2021, Mike will go over our guidance in a few moments. \u2047 But I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition announcements and provide highlights related to our growth momentum and 2021 plan. \u2047 Starting on Slide 11, in addition to the accomplishments I just mentioned, we have reinforced our global flavor leadership and accelerated our condiment and flavors growth platforms with the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. \u2047 Cholula, an iconic brand and a high growth category is a leading Mexican hot sauce and highly complements our existing hot sauce portfolio, broadening our flavor offerings to consumers and food service operators. \u2047 FONA, a leading North American manufacturer of flavors increases the scale of our global flavors platform, with the addition of its highly complementary portfolio to our Flavor Solutions segment, expanding our breadth and accelerating our portfolio migration, more value-added and technically insulated products. \u2047 We're excited about the 2021 growth contributions we expect from Cholula and FONA, which closed at the end of November and December respectively. \u2047 For both acquisitions, our transition and integration activities are progressing according to our plans and the alignment of our organizations is under way to deliver on opportunities quickly and to aggressively drive growth. \u2047 We have a proven playbook and unmatched expertise to effectively and efficiently unlock Cholula's significant growth potential. \u2047 In our Consumer segment we will leverage our operational expertise and infrastructure to elevate Cholula's brand presence, increase the availability of its products and extended its product offerings into new flavors, formats and eating occasions to drive trial and household penetration. \u2047 Building our enthusiasm is an outstanding momentum Cholula carried into 2021 continuing to outpace category growth with strong consumption. \u2047 In our Flavor solutions segment with our broad presence across all foodservice channels we'll be focusing on strengthening Cholula's go-to-market model. \u2047 There are opportunities to expand Chol"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.79 excluding items.  \u2047  q4 sales rose 5 percent.  \u2047  in 2021, company expects to grow sales by 7% to 9%
