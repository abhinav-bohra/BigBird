{"article": ["Andy Simanek, head of investor relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. \u2047 Also, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. \u2047 Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency. \u2047 I am amazed by the resilience of our customers, partners, and team members. \u2047 And I'm incredibly proud of the way Hewlett Packard Enterprise continues to serve the needs of our global communities during such an unusual and evolving circumstances. \u2047 We delivered a very impressive third quarter at HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins, and record free cash flow. \u2047 Overall, I am pleased to see how our differentiated portfolio is resonating with the market and our edge-to-cloud strategy is driving improved momentum across our businesses. \u2047 Based on the strength of our Q3 performance and our confidence about our momentum in the market, we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 earnings per share and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases. \u2047 Revenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality. \u2047 Our Q3 orders were up strong double digits year over year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our edge-to-cloud offerings. \u2047 We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share, up 28% and 27% year over year, respectively. \u2047 We generated record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year over year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October. \u2047 I am particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results while mitigating against industrywide supply constraints by taking proactive inventory measures working closely with our suppliers and deploy our best-in-class engineering capabilities to establish specific response plans. \u2047 The impact of the pandemic continue to accelerate the shift we predicted years ago to an edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven world. \u2047 Now more than ever, there is a greater need for secure connectivity, faster insights from data, and a cloud experience everywhere. \u2047 We expect these trends to continue. \u2047 Digital transformation is no longer a priority but a strategic imperative. \u2047 To help our customers transform their businesses and be future-ready today, we have been focused on doubling down in key areas that are resonating strongly in the market. \u2047 We had a record number of orders in both our intelligent edge business and high-performance compute and mission-critical solutions business. \u2047 Due to strong demand and execution, these growth businesses now make up nearly 25% of our total company revenue. \u2047 Our intelligent edge business accelerated its momentum again in Q3, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by a record number of new orders. \u2047 Strong customer demand for secure connectivity has generated a backlog five times greater than at the close of Q3 last year, as customers increasingly look for solutions to collect, connect, analyze, and act on data at the edge. \u2047 We are leaning into this demand and continue to invest and innovate at the edge. \u2047 In June, we announced new AI ops, IoT, and security features for our Aruba Edge Services Platform, or ESP, designed to streamline network operations, maximize IT efficiency, and more easily extend the network from the edge to the cloud. \u2047 Our Aruba ESP continues to gain traction with customers in different verticals. \u2047 In the third quarter, customers including Save A Lot, Monument Health, and Circa Resort and Casino, all standardized their networks on Aruba ESP. \u2047 In our high-performance compute and mission-critical solutions business, revenue was up 9% year over year, driven by a record number of new orders. \u2047 We also generated a record order book, which now exceeds $2.5 billion. \u2047 The exponential growth in data, along with AI and big data analytics, are all driving an increased need for high-performance computing and mission-critical capabilities in enterprises of all sizes. \u2047 To meet this demand, we bolstered our artificial intelligence capabilities with the acquisition of Determined AI, a start-up that delivers a puzzle software stack that to train AI models faster at any scale using its open-source machine learning platform. \u2047 We also continued to see an increasing number of customers accessing our high-performance computer solutions as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake. \u2047 With our HPE GreenLake Cloud Services for HPC, customers gained powerful specialized computing and AI capabilities with a sustainable cloud experience. \u2047 For example, in Q3, HPE was awarded a $2 billion contract to be realized over a 10-year period with the National Security Agency to deliver high-performance computing solutions through the HP GreenLake platform. \u2047 The service will help the National Security Agency efficiently process data and unlock new insights in sustainable new ways. \u2047 Our core businesses generated robust year-over-year orders growth, as well as strong profitability and free cash flow in the quarter. \u2047 Year to date, compute and storage orders are up mid-single digits, with Q3 operating margins of 11.2% and 15.1%, respectively. \u2047 We continue to offer more of our core capabilities as-a-Service. \u2047 In Q3, we introduced unified compute operations as-a-Service through our HP GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. \u2047 This new cloud-based management service simplifies provisioning and automates the management of compute infrastructure wherever it resides. \u2047 Our storage business is transforming into a cloud-native software-defined data services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions. \u2047 In May, we introduced our new cloud data services available through HPE GreenLake, as well as a new HPE Alletra cloud-native data infrastructure. \u2047 And just this week, we closed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection, and run some way of data recovery services, which will be soon available as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake. \u2047 This acquisition immediately positions HPE GreenLake in the high-growth data protection market with a proven scale solution. \u2047 HPE was the first to market four years ago in delivering and as-a-Service cloud experience on-premises in a colocation or at the edge with HPE GreenLake. \u2047 Today, our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform has more than 1,100 customers. \u2047 Our annualized revenue run rate this quarter was $705 million, up 33% year over year, driven by strong as-a-Service orders growth, up 46% year over year. \u2047 Organizations across sectors, including retail, healthcare, financial services, and public sector, are turning to HPE GreenLake. \u2047 For instance, we helped Liberty Mutual shift from a traditional capex IT spend to a new pay-as-you-go model, creating a cloud experience on-premises to provide transparency into consumption while improving their speed in adapting to capacity demands. \u2047 They standardized critical workloads on HPE Synergy delivered through HPE GreenLake, resulting in a reduced data center footprint and significant cost savings, including a monthly unit rate well below public cloud alternatives. \u2047 We also see in the power of the full HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio as customers are turning to HPE for integrated solutions that combine secure connectivity, data insight capabilities, and cloud experiences. \u2047 Woolworths Group Australia and New Zealand's largest retailer selected HPE GreenLake to power its new Wpay payment platform. \u2047 They needed a solution that combines a powerful mission-critical architecture with the ability to scale and also provide a better cost efficiency back to Wpay and its merchant partners. \u2047 Delivered through HPE GreenLake, their solution leverages our full edge-to-cloud portfolio, including HPE Aruba, HPE NonStop, HPE Primera, and HPE Synergy. \u2047 HPE Pointnext Services also provided expertise to us over the company's digital transformation. \u2047 I believe this is a great example of the power of our HPE edge-to-cloud portfolio. \u2047 To extend our leadership position in cloud services and further accelerate our pivot as-a-Service, we are relentlessly innovating. \u2047 We made several compelling announcements at HPE Discover in June. \u2047 I am particularly excited about our new HPE GreenLake Lighthouse offering, a secure cloud-native stack built with HPE Ezmeral software to autonomously optimize different workloads across hybrid estate, reducing time to deployment and operating costs. \u2047 We also introduced Project Aurora to secure the enterprise, embedded in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. \u2047 Project Aurora automatically and continuously verifies and attests the integrity of the hardware, freeware operating systems, platforms and workloads, while also detecting advanced threats. \u2047 And finally, demonstrating our continued commitment to acquiring assets that complement our own capabilities, we acquired data platform developer Ampool. \u2047 Ampool will accelerate HPE Ezmeral analytics run time to deliver high-performance analytics for engineers and business analysts. \u2047 I am proud of HPE's performance in Q3 and year to date and the significant progress we have made in becoming the edge-to-cloud company. \u2047 The momentum we have in the market compels us to move even further and faster, and our ability to transform with increasing speed is imperative. \u2047 This transformation is my No. \u2047 At this pivotal moment, our purpose to advance the way people in the work has never been more important. \u2047 Our vision to become the edge-to-cloud company is proving its tremendous relevance and our portfolio is winning in the marketplace. \u2047 Fueled by our purpose, vision, and portfolio, we have the opportunity to build a more digitally enabled inclusive world. \u2047 We have a mandate to imagine new digital transformation strategies that support our own ESG goals and those of our customers, leading to better business outcomes and societal impact. \u2047 We will never waver from our commitment to being a force for good and a strategic partner for our customers. \u2047 We will continue to bring bold new innovation to our customers, and we will continue to create value for our shareholders. \u2047 And I'm grateful for the incredible team, and I'm confident in and excited about the future. \u2047 I hope you will join us for our virtual Security Analyst Meeting on October 28 to hear more about our position in the market, our priorities, and our outlook for the year ahead. \u2047 I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. \u2047 Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slides 1 and 2. \u2047 So, now let me discuss our Q3 performance, starting with Slide 3. \u2047 I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing very strong demand across all of our businesses. \u2047 Q3 was marked by accelerating order growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and robust cash flow generation. \u2047 Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter and in line with normal sequential seasonality, also in line with our outlook that factored in some of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged. \u2047 We're working to ensure disruption is minimal by taking proactive measures and coordinating with our world-class suppliers to establish tailored recovery plans. \u2047 I am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior-year period. \u2047 This is driven by our deliberate actions to shift toward higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline, and cost takeout. \u2047 As previously indicated, we continue to invest in high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio, both in R&D and go-to-market, particularly in Aruba Software and as-a-Service, which increased our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter. \u2047 We also booked two one-time charging totally $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud involving a channel partner in APJ. \u2047 Even with these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit. \u2047 We continue to be focused on driving further efficiencies in the business. \u2047 Within other income and expense, we benefited from stronger operational performance in H3C and strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio. \u2047 As a result, we now expect other income and expense for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately $50 million. \u2047 With strong execution across the business and despite two unanticipated one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3. \u2047 Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $526 million. \u2047 This puts us at a record $1.5 billion of year-to-date free cash flow, up $1.1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in operating profit. \u2047 Finally, the strength of our business has positioned us to contribute substantial capital to our shareholders. \u2047 We paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. \u2047 We are also announcing today the resumption of share buybacks as a result of greater free cash flow generation and visibility. \u2047 I'll come back to capital allocation more broadly when we discuss the outlook. \u2047 Now, let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. \u2047 Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, are executing strongly and experiencing record order levels. \u2047 In the Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our top-line momentum with record levels of orders and 23% year-over-year revenue growth. \u2047 Switching was up over 20% year over year, whereas wireless LAN experienced more acute supply constraints and was up mid-single digits. \u2047 Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year over year, which reflects enabling software platforms, as well as Network-as-a-Service. \u2047 We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.8% in Q3, up 540 basis points year over year, which included a $17 million one-time legal settlement that impacted margins by 2 points. \u2047 Silver Peak continues to perform strongly and contributed 7 points to the Intelligent Edge growth. \u2047 In addition, we started generating meaningful revenue synergies by cross-selling the Aruba portfolio, which reinforces the merits"], "gold_summary": ["hewlett packard enterprise q3 adj earnings per share $0.47.  \u2047  q3 revenue $6.9 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $6.93
