{"article": ["Today's call is being recorded. \u2047 An archive of the recording will be available later today in the IR Calendar section of the News & Events tab at our IR website, www. \u2047 These materials are labeled Q3 2021 Earnings Conference Call. \u2047 Certain risk factors that may impact our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. \u2047 Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share attributable to Equifax, and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. \u2047 We had a very strong third quarter and first nine months of 2021, a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of $1.223 billion, which was up over 14% with core non-mortgage market and non-UC ERC claims revenue growth of 20%. \u2047 We are executing extremely well against the critical priorities of our EFX2023 strategy, as we highlighted on Slide 4. \u2047 Our focus on leveraging the new Equifax cloud for innovation, new products and growth is clearly driving our strong financial results. \u2047 Our revenue growth has accelerated from 3% in 2019 as we were recovering from the 2017 cyber event and investing heavily in our EFX cloud transformation to 17% last year. \u2047 We are on track to deliver 19% core growth this year at the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance. \u2047 More importantly, our core growth, which excludes the impact of the mortgage market, unemployment claims and ERC-related revenues is expected to accelerate to 21% this year, a powerful figure that reflects the strength of our underlying business model and EFX2023 growth strategy. \u2047 Not only is our core growth accelerating above historical levels during 2021 in challenging COVID markets and more recently, in a declining mortgage market, we are also expanding EFX beyond our traditional credit deal routes to a more diverse data analytics and technology company with our investments in the Equifax cloud, new data assets and NPIs, along with reinvesting our outperformance in bolt-on M&A in areas such as talent, government and ID and fraud. \u2047 We are quickly pivoting from building the Equifax cloud to leveraging it for innovation, new products that will position the new Equifax for stronger and more diversified growth in the future. \u2047 Our EFX2023 growth strategy remains our compass for the future and drives all of our top and bottom line growth initiatives, as we move toward 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5, Equifax had a very strong quarter. \u2047 Revenue at $1.22 billion was up 14.5% with organic constant currency growth of a strong 12%. \u2047 The almost 15% topline growth was off a strong 19% growth last year in a much stronger mortgage market. \u2047 This was our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. \u2047 More importantly, our core growth was up a strong 20%. \u2047 Our U.S. B2B businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 75% of Equifax revenue, again drove our growth, delivering 17% revenue growth despite the 21% decline in the U.S. mortgage market in the quarter. \u2047 Non-mortgage revenue was up over 30%. \u2047 And organic non-mortgage revenue was up 24%, strengthening sequentially from the 16% and 20% we saw in the first two quarters of the year. \u2047 Third quarter Equifax adjusted EBITDA totaled $404 million, up slightly from third quarter last year with margins of 33%. \u2047 As expected, margins were down versus 2020 due to the inclusion of cloud technology transformation costs of $45 million in our adjusted results in the quarter, which were excluded last year. \u2047 And redundant cloud transformation systems cost of $15 million. \u2047 These costs related to cloud tech transformation negatively impacted EBITDA margins by almost 500 basis points. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share of $1.85 a share was down slightly from last year. \u2047 Adjusting for the cloud transformation costs of $45 million or $0.27 a share, adjusted earnings per share would have been up a strong 11%. \u2047 We continue to make significant progress executing the EFX cloud data and technology transformation. \u2047 In the quarter, we completed 4,000 B2B customer migrations, for a total of 15,400 migrations completed so far this year. \u2047 In September alone, USIS completed over 900 customer migrations. \u2047 Since the beginning of the transformation, we've completed almost 97,000 B2B migrations, 3.5 million consumer migrations, and 1 million data contributor migrations. \u2047 We remain on track and confident in our plan. \u2047 We continue to expect the North American transformation to be principally complete in early 2022, with the remaining customer migrations broadly completing by the end of next year. \u2047 International transformation will follow, being principally completed by the end of 2023, with some customer migrations continuing into 2024. \u2047 We're still in the early days of leveraging the cloud, but remain confident that will differentiate us commercially, expand our NPI capabilities, accelerate our topline and expand our margins and the growth in cost savings in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Our NPI performance also continues to accelerate. \u2047 In the quarter, we released 30 new products and we still expect our Vitality Index to accelerate from 5% last year to over 8% in 2021. \u2047 Given our very strong third quarter performance, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance by approximately 320 basis points or $131 million, at the midpoint of a range between $4.9 billion to $4.921 billion, up 19% from last year, and increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.22 per share to a midpoint of $7.57 per share, which adjusting for technology transformation cost implies a 23% growth in EPS. \u2047 Roughly two-thirds of the 320 basis point increase in our revenue growth framework to 19% is from organic business performance, with the balance from the acquisition of Appriss, Health e(fx) and Teletrack, which we expect to add about $45 million to revenue in the fourth quarter. \u2047 In the third quarter, Equifax core revenue growth, the green sections of the bars on Slide 6, grew a very strong 20%, a third consecutive quarter of core growth at or above 20%. \u2047 Non-mortgage growth in EWS and USIS and growth in International drove about 900 basis points to core revenue growth, excluding acquisitions and FX, with mortgage outperformance primarily in Workforce Solutions driving about 800 basis points of organic core growth in the quarter. \u2047 As we move through '22 and '23, we expect to continue to see strong and balanced core growth, reflecting the benefits of the new EFX Cloud, accelerated NPIs, continued strong non-mortgage growth, both from organic growth and acquisitions, as well as continued strong outperformance from Workforce Solutions. \u2047 Turning to Slide 7, Workforce Solutions had another exceptional quarter, delivering revenue of $508 million, which was up 35%. \u2047 This is the first quarter Workforce Solutions has delivered over $0.5 billion of revenue in a single quarter, a big milestone. \u2047 This was against a very strong 57% growth last year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margins were up -- were 54%. \u2047 Non-mortgage revenue at Workforce Solutions was up over 48% with organic non-mortgage revenue up 41%. \u2047 The strength of Workforce Solutions and uniqueness of their twin income and employment data set was clear again in the third quarter. \u2047 Workforce's Verification Services revenue of $403 million was up a strong 34%. \u2047 Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 22% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market with the EWS outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products. \u2047 Importantly, Verification Services non-mortgage revenue was up 55% in the quarter, consistent with the very strong growth we saw last quarter. \u2047 Our government vertical, which provides solutions to federal and state governments in support of assistance programs, including food and rental support, grew over 20% in the quarter. \u2047 Government remains one of our largest non-mortgage segments with attractive growth potential in the future and represents about one-third of non-mortgage verification revenue. \u2047 Our new SSA contract went live this quarter at relatively low start-up volumes, and we expect to see it ramp as we move through 2022. \u2047 We expect new products, the addition of Appriss and expanded federal and state social services to fuel growth in our government vertical in the future. \u2047 Talent Solutions, which provides income employment verifications as well as other information for the hiring and onboarding processes through our EWS data hub, had another outstanding quarter from customer expansion and NPIs growing over 100%. \u2047 Talent Solutions now represents almost 30% of non-mortgage verification revenue. \u2047 As you know, over 75 million people change jobs in the U.S. annually with the vast majority having some level of screening as a part of the hiring process. \u2047 The addition of Appriss Insights and our new partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse will fuel growth and new products in this important vertical. \u2047 The non-mortgage consumer lending business, principally in banking and auto, showed strong growth as well of about 90% in the quarter, both from deepening penetration with lenders and from some recovery in these markets, although auto has been impacted by inventory shortages. \u2047 Employer Services revenue of $105 million was up $30 million in the quarter. \u2047 This is an important growth engine for Workforce Solutions that also delivers records. \u2047 Combined, our unemployment claims and employee retention credit businesses had revenue of about $65 million, up about $14 million from last year. \u2047 Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses had revenue of about $40 million, up 60%, with organic growth of about 35%. \u2047 Our I-9, business driven by our new I-9 Anywhere product continue to show very strong growth, up about 80%. \u2047 Our, I-9 business is now almost half of Employer Services non-UC and ERC revenue. \u2047 Reflecting the growth in I-9 and the return to growth of Workforce Analytics, we expect Employer Services non-UC and ERC businesses, to deliver total growth of about 40% and organic growth of about 25% in the year. \u2047 Reflecting the uniqueness between data, strong verify our revenue and operating leverage resulted an adjusted Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins of 54.3%. \u2047 The decline versus last year is driven -- protect, driven by investments in the tech transformation, as well as redundant systems cost, and as well as significant investments in Data Onboarding, Sales and Marketing to continue to drive Workforce Solutions growth. \u2047 Rudy Floater and the Workforce Solutions team delivered another outstanding quarter and are positioned to deliver a very strong 2021, 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Turning now to USIS, their revenue of $380 million was up slightly from last year. \u2047 Total USIS mortgage revenue of $148 million was down 17%, while mortgage credit inquiries were down 21%, slightly better than the down 23% we expected in July. \u2047 USIS out-performance versus the overall market was driven by growth in marketing and debt monitoring products. \u2047 Importantly, non-mortgage revenue of $240 million grew almost 8% -- sorry, 16% with organic growth of over 9%. \u2047 Year-to-date, non-mortgage revenue was up a strong 17%, and organic non-mortgage revenue growth is over 10%. \u2047 Banking, insurance, commercial and direct-to-consumer, were all up over 10% in the quarter. \u2047 Fraud was up almost 10% organically and up over 75% in total with the inclusion of our Kount acquisition. \u2047 Auto was up mid-single digits, despite supply pressures and telco was down just over 5%. \u2047 Financial Marketing Services revenue, which is broadly speaking our off-line or batch business, was $55 million in the quarter and up about 20%. \u2047 The strong performance was driven by marketing-related which was up over 20%, and ID and fraud revenue, which grew over 15%. \u2047 In 2021, marketing-related revenue is expected to represent about 40% of FMS revenue, identity and fraud above 20% and risk decisioning about 35%. \u2047 The USIS sales team delivered record wins up over 20% versus last year and 40% sequentially in the quarter. \u2047 The new deal pipeline in USIS remains very strong. \u2047 During the quarter, USIS acquired Teletrack, a U.S. leader in alternative credit data. \u2047 Teletrack is being consolidated with DataX, our specialty finance credit reporting agency that we acquired in 2018, to expand our capabilities in the fast-growing alternative data space, serving unbanked and underbanked U.S. consumers. \u2047 The USIS adjusted EBITDA margins were 40% in the quarter, flat sequentially with second quarter. \u2047 Similar to second quarter, the decline in margins in the quarter versus last year was due to both costs related to cloud transformation, which include the cost of redundant systems and inclusion of our adjusted results of the technology transformation costs which are being excluded in 2020 and the expansion of our investments in sales and marketing, as well as new products to leverage both the strengthening U.S. market and accelerate new product introductions to drive revenue growth in '22 and beyond. \u2047 The revenue of $245 million was up 10% on a local currency basis and up 100 basis points sequentially. \u2047 This was the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our global markets following the COVID pandemic impacts. \u2047 Asia Pacific, which is principally our Australia business, performed well in the quarter with revenue of $89 million, up about 7% in local currency. \u2047 Australia delivered this growth despite the extended COVID lockdowns in many portions of that country. \u2047 Australia consumer revenue continued to recover, up 3% versus last year and about flat sequentially. \u2047 Our Commercial businesses combined online and off-line revenue was up 8% in the quarter. \u2047 Fraud and identity was up 13%, following 22% growth in the first half. \u2047 European revenues of $68 million were up 9% in local currency in the quarter and flat sequentially. \u2047 Our European credit reporting business was up about 5% with continued growth in both the U.K. and Spain. \u2047 Our European debt management business revenue increased by about 21% in local currency, off the lows we saw last year during the COVID recession. \u2047 Canada delivered revenue of $44 million in the quarter, up over 8% in local currency despite a weakening Canadian mortgage market that was down 15%. \u2047 Canada experienced strong growth in fintech while supply issues continue to impact our auto business. \u2047 Latin American revenues of $45 million grew 16%"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per
