{"article": ["We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. \u2047 We certainly appreciate you all joining us today, and I hope everybody is staying well. \u2047 I want to start with something difficult. \u2047 I want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the Sorenson family and the thousands of Marriott associates around the world following the heartbreaking news of Arne's passing. \u2047 To say I'm deeply saddened by that loss, it would be an understatement. \u2047 As many of you know, had the opportunity to work with Arne in a number of capacities throughout my career, including earlier on at Host. \u2047 I think it's very fair to say he was an exceptional leader, but also an incredible person and a great friend. \u2047 Our industry is better because of him, and I am a better professional and a better person because of him. \u2047 On behalf of everyone at Hilton family, the entire Marriott family are in our thoughts. \u2047 As we all know, this past year has presented unique challenges, including a pandemic that devastated lives, communities, and businesses across the world, widespread economic declines and acts of social injustice. \u2047 Due to the extraordinary levels of disruption, our industry experienced demand declines we've never seen before in our 101-year history. \u2047 Guided by our founding purpose, to make the world a better place through the light and warmth of hospitality, we acted quickly to ensure the safety and well-being of our people. \u2047 We also took steps to protect our business by rightsizing our cost structure and enhancing our liquidity position while continuing to drive net unit growth and increase our network effect. \u2047 As a result of these moves, we expect to recover from the pandemic as a stronger, higher-margin business that is even better positioned to deliver performance for our owners and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. \u2047 While it's certainly been a very difficult year, we're proud of everything we've accomplished, but we certainly could not have done it without the support of all of our stakeholders. \u2047 Because of our amazing people, we've been able to lean on our award-winning culture, which earned the number one Best Place to Work in the United States for the second consecutive year and the number three World's Best Workplace to help get us through these trying times. \u2047 For the full year, systemwide RevPAR declined 57% with adjusted EBITDA down only modestly, more illustrating the resiliency of our fee-based model. \u2047 We also demonstrated the strength of our brands and power of our customer-centric strategy by achieving market share gains across every region, even in a distressed business environment. \u2047 For the quarter, systemwide RevPAR declined 59%, relatively in line with our expectations. \u2047 The positive momentum in demand that we saw through the summer and early fall was disrupted in November, December by rising COVID cases, tightening travel restrictions and further hotel suspensions, particularly in Europe. \u2047 Similar to the third quarter, drive to leisure travel drove an outsized portion of demand. \u2047 Business transient and group trends showed modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter, but overall demand remained quite muted. \u2047 As we look to the year ahead, we remain optimistic that accelerating vaccine distribution will lead to easing government restrictions and unlock pent-up travel demand. \u2047 For the first quarter, overall trends so far appear to be similar to the fourth quarter with modest increases in demand in the U.S., offsetting stalled recoveries in Europe and Asia Pacific. \u2047 We expect improving fundamentals heading into spring with essentially all systemwide rooms reopened by the end of the second quarter. \u2047 We expect a more pronounced recovery in the back half of the year driven by increased leisure demand and meaningful rebounds in corporate transient and group business. \u2047 Over the last year, the personal savings rate in the United States has nearly doubled, increasing by more than $1.6 trillion to $2.9 trillion, with the potential to go even higher given additional stimulus. \u2047 We expect this to drive greater leisure demand as travel restrictions ease and markets reopened the tourism. \u2047 Additionally, conversations with our large corporate customers along with sequential upticks in business transient booking pace year-to-date indicate that there is pent-up demand for business travel that should drive a recovery in corporate transient trends as the year progresses. \u2047 On the group side, we saw a meaningful step-up in new group demand in January with our back half group position showing significant sequential improvement versus the first half of the year. \u2047 With roughly 70% of bookings made within a week of travel, overall visibility remains limited. \u2047 However, we continue to see signs of optimism. \u2047 In fact, the vast majority of our large corporate accounts agreed to extend 2020 negotiated rates into this year. \u2047 Despite the challenges in 2020, we opened more than 400 hotels, totaling nearly 56,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.1%, slightly ahead of guidance. \u2047 Fourth quarter openings were up nearly 30% year-over-year, largely driven by new development in China, where our focused-service brands continue to command a disproportionate share of industry growth. \u2047 We also celebrated our 1,000,000th room milestone and the openings of our 300th hotel in China, our 600th DoubleTree hotel and our 900th Hilton Garden Inn. \u2047 We ended up the year with 397,000 rooms in our development pipeline, up 3% year-over-year. \u2047 While market disruption weighed on new development signings, conversion signings increased more than 30% versus the prior year. \u2047 As owners look to benefit from the strength of our network, we anticipate continued positive momentum and conversion activity, particularly through DoubleTree and our collection brands. \u2047 During the quarter, we signed agreements to expand our Curio Collection in Mexico and bring our Tapestry Collection to Portugal. \u2047 This marks one of several new Tapestry hotels scheduled to open across Europe this year. \u2047 We also announced plans to debut LXR in the Seychelles with Mango House Seychelles. \u2047 The property will deliver a truly unique hospitality experience with spaces, guest rooms and suites and five world-class food and beverage venues. \u2047 Scheduled to open in the coming months, the hotel underscores our commitment to further expanding our resort portfolio. \u2047 Building on that momentum, we kicked off 2021 with an agreement to bring LXR to Bali. \u2047 Additionally, we celebrated the openings of Oceana Santa Monica, which marked LXR's U.S. debut as well as the Waldorf Astoria, Monarch Beach Resort and the Hilton Vancouver Downtown, which was converted from a competitor brand. \u2047 With these notable openings and many exciting development opportunities in front of us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering solid growth over the next several years. \u2047 The pandemic rapidly changed guest behaviors, priorities and concerns. \u2047 We listen to our customers and move quickly to launch modifications to our Honors loyalty program, deliver industry-leading standards of cleanliness and hygiene with Hilton CleanStay and provide flexible, distraction-free environments for remote work with WorkSpaces by Hilton. \u2047 Additionally, with an even stronger focus on recovery, last month, we implemented Hilton EventReady Hybrid Solutions, an expanded set of resources to help event planners address the dramatic shift toward hybrid meetings as group business rebounds. \u2047 Our flexibility and innovation drove continued growth in our Honors network, ending the year with more than 112 million members who accounted for approximately 60% of systemwide occupancy. \u2047 Throughout 2020, we also remained focused on our corporate responsibility and our commitment to our ESG initiatives. \u2047 We're proud to contribute to our communities, and we're honored to be named the global industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. \u2047 And earmarked by challenge and change, we effectively executed our crisis response strategy, carefully managed key stakeholder relationships and continued to press forward on strategic opportunities. \u2047 I'm confident that there are brighter days ahead and that we are in a stronger, more resilient, and we are better positioned than ever before. \u2047 Before I begin, I'd like to echo Chris' sentiments about Arne. \u2047 During the quarter, systemwide RevPAR declined 59.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the pandemic continued to disrupt the demand environment. \u2047 Relative to the third quarter, occupancy was modestly lower, partially due to seasonality and further tempered by rising COVID cases and associated travel restrictions. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million in the fourth quarter, down 65% year-over-year. \u2047 Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. \u2047 Management and franchise fees decreased 50%, less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better-than-expected Honors license fees and development fees. \u2047 Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. \u2047 For the full year, our corporate G&A expenses were down nearly 30% year-over-year at the high end of our expectations. \u2047 Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging demand environment, temporary closures in Europe and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. \u2047 Continued cost control measures, coupled with onetime items mitigated segment losses. \u2047 For the fourth -- for the quarter, diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.10. \u2047 Turning to our balance sheet. \u2047 We continue to enhance our liquidity position and preserve our financial flexibility. \u2047 Over the last few months, we opportunistically refinanced $3.4 billion of senior notes to extend our maturities at lower rates. \u2047 In January, we also repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. \u2047 On a pro forma basis, taking these transactions into effect as of year-end 2020, we've lowered our weighted average cost of debt to 3.6% and extended our weighted average maturity to 7.2 years. \u2047 We have no major debt maturities until 2024 and maintain a well-staggered maturity ladder thereafter. \u2047 We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. \u2047 [Operator Instructions] Chad, can we have our first question, please? \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted loss per share $0.10.  \u2047  hilton worldwide - system-wide comparable revpar decreased 59.2 percent and 56.7 percent on a currency
