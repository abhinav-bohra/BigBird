{"article": ["We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. \u2047 On a combined basis, these items had a net favorable impact on after-tax earnings of approximately $30 million during the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Even if one chooses to ignore the favorable impact entirely, our earnings during the quarter still exceeded our internal forecast by a wide margin. \u2047 For most of the second quarter, we experienced a continued decline in the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in our hospitals and a corresponding recovery in the number of non-COVID patients. \u2047 As a result, most of our key volume metrics, including acute and behavioral patient days, emergency room visits and surgical cases grew to levels approaching those that we were tracking before the pandemic began. \u2047 This robust recovery in volumes exceeded the pace of our original forecast and drove the favorable operating results even in the face of continuing labor pressures in both of our business segments. \u2047 Our cash generated from operating activities was $119 million during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $1.45 billion during the same period in 2020. \u2047 The decline in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the previously announced early repayment of $695 million of Medicare accelerated payments, which were received by us during 2020 and repaid to the government during the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 We spent $482 million on capital expenditures during the first six months of 2021. \u2047 At June 30, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 35.7% as compared to 38.3% at June 30, 2020. \u2047 As previously announced, we resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021 after suspending it in April 2020 as the COVID volume surged for the first time. \u2047 During the second quarter of 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.21 million shares at an aggregate cost of $350 million. \u2047 And yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion increase to our stock repurchase program, leaving $1.2 billion remaining authorization. \u2047 We were extremely pleased with our second quarter 2021 operating results, which we noted were well ahead of our internal forecast. \u2047 As a consequence, we also raised our full year earnings guidance, including an approximately 6% to 8% increase in our full year forecasted adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 I would note that during the past four to six weeks, many of our hospitals have experienced significant surges in the number of COVID patients, and it is not evident that this surge has yet reached its peak. \u2047 Given the uncertain impact of this most recent surge on non-COVID volumes and on labor shortages, we based our guidance for the second half of the year, primarily on our original internal forecast. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["universal health services increases 2021 fy earnings guidance."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q2 earnings per share $0.08.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.08.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.08."]}
