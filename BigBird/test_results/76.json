{"article": ["Both are now available on the Investors section of our website, americanassetstrust.com. \u2047 First and foremost, I would like to wish all our stakeholders and their loved ones continued health and safety during these truly unprecedented times. \u2047 Now that people are starting to get vaccinated, we are optimistic and even hopeful eventually this pandemic will no longer be a threat, lives will return to some kind of normalcy and the economy will recover. \u2047 However, at the present time, this pandemic continues to create challenges within our portfolio, particularly for our three theaters, gym's and our Waikiki Beach Walk properties. \u2047 As most of you know, all of our properties in Hawaii are owned fee simple and are very valuable. \u2047 We have a strong view that post-pandemic, Waikiki will return to normal, pent up tourism returning and every night being like a Friday night. \u2047 While this pandemic still remains a threat that we believe we are well prepared to endure a prolonged pandemic with our irreplaceable portfolio, our best-in-class operating platform, our top-notch management team, our disciplined financial strength and a very strong balance sheet. \u2047 In such regard, I am extremely proud to announce that our inaugural public offering, which we closed on January 26, 2021, the offering consists of $500 million of 3.38% senior unsecured notes due 2031. \u2047 And by the way, it was oversubscribed 4 times. \u2047 Success and demand of this bond offering in the midst of a pandemic is truly a testament to our incredible properties, efficient operating portfolio, and our top-notch management team. \u2047 Bob will provide more financial details on the bond offering. \u2047 Finally, I'd like to mention that the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.28 for the first quarter, an increase of $0.03 from our previous dividend, which we believe is supported by our collection efforts in the fourth quarter, and is an expression of our Board's confidence in the embedded growth of our portfolio that we believe will recover post-pandemic. \u2047 As you can see, we're mutually cooperative. \u2047 We remain optimistic with the overall performance of our portfolio, even in light of the pandemic, and we are pleased to report that 100% of our properties are currently open and accessible by our tenants in each of our markets. \u2047 Of course, we too have felt the bumps along the road like everyone else in our sectors. \u2047 Yet, our collections of monthly recurring billings due continued to improve in Q4 over Q3 and Q3 over Q2. \u2047 The total collections to-date of approximately 92% in Q4 versus 90% in Q3 and 87% in Q2. \u2047 January is currently trending consistent with Q4, just over 91% to-date, and likely to increase further, all despite the headwinds of Governor Newsom shutdown restrictions in California that lasted through most of December and January. \u2047 Collections for essential tenants in our retail portfolio, which represent approximately one-third of retail build rents were almost 100% in Q3 and Q4. \u2047 And collections for nonessential tenants continued to improve from 69% in Q3 to over 74% in Q4. \u2047 Of note, no tenant in our retail portfolio represents more than 2% of our ABR, and less than 6% of our retail portfolio is due to expire in 2021, assuming no exercise of lease options. \u2047 And of the approximately 500 tenants in our retail portfolio, since the beginning of the pandemic, we have had 13 retailers file bankruptcy, covering 18 total tenant lease spaces, of which 13 spaces have been assumed or are in the process of being assumed in bankruptcy, which we believe is a testament to us having superior locations that these restructured tenants want to remain in. \u2047 Notably, the rejected leases to-date were less than 13,000 square feet in the aggregate. \u2047 As you would expect, our primary collection challenges remain in the retail segment with our movie theaters and gym's, as well as many of our retailers at Waikiki Beach Walk, which until mid-October had no incoming tourism to sustain meaningful revenue for our tenants. \u2047 So, we believe the pent-up demand for travel to Hawaii is massive. \u2047 We expect the tourism to rebound to occur at more deliberate pace until a broader vaccine rollout is achieved, hopefully by this upcoming summer. \u2047 In the meantime, we are working with these challenged retailers who historically have been great operators to bridge them through to the recovery. \u2047 This is part of our recurring thesis of prioritizing long-term strategic growth over the short term. \u2047 Despite the uncertainty, we remain optimistic that we will continue to see sequential improvement spurred by the vaccine's distribution, government stimulus and anticipated pent up travel demand in regions that have yet to fully reopen their economies. \u2047 As Ernest mentioned, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through and manage these challenges. \u2047 We have been through challenging times before and each time we have emerged stronger, given our long-term focus on high quality, diversified asset base. \u2047 We expect this time will be no different. \u2047 Last night, we reported fourth quarter and year ended 2020 FFO per share of $0.41 and $1.89 respectively, and fourth quarter and year ended 2020 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.05 and $0.46 respectively. \u2047 The lower FFO in the fourth quarter, which is approximately $0.05 lower than the Bloomberg consensus is primarily the result of additional reserves for our theaters, gym's and Waikiki Beach Walk retail. \u2047 Nevertheless, we remain optimistic of this portfolio, even in light of the pandemic. \u2047 The highlights of this quarter are, one, we have ample liquidity. \u2047 As Ernest previously mentioned, we recently completed our inaugural public bond offering. \u2047 In the midst of this unprecedented pandemic, we closed on $500 million of 3.38% 10-year senior unsecured notes. \u2047 With the proceeds from the offering, we repaid $150 million Senior Guaranteed Notes Series A and repaid the $100 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit. \u2047 We expect to use remaining $236 million of proceeds to fund our La Jolla Commons III development in the UTC submarket of San Diego, as well as continue our renovation of One Beach Street in San Francisco, with the remaining amounts for general corporate purposes and potential accretive acquisition opportunities. \u2047 At the beginning of this week, we had approximately $380 million of cash on the balance sheet with zero outstanding on our $350 million line of credit. \u2047 We chose to access the public debt markets now because of the low treasury yield and strength of the credit markets that we've been seeing during this pandemic. \u2047 We had the ability to access the public debt market several years prior to this, but we weren't ready to commit to being a regular issuer on a frequent basis until now. \u2047 What's changed is that we have the ability to ladder our existing debt maturities today, so that we have close to, if not more than $400 million in future debt requirements on a recurring basis over an 18 to 24-month period, while at the same time being laser focused on a 5.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA or less. \u2047 A conservative balance sheet is very important to us. \u2047 During this pandemic, our EBITDA has been challenged, like others with exposure to retail and our hotel, resulting in lower EBITDA. \u2047 We believe that our high-quality portfolio and superior close to West Coast locations will begin to return to normal post-pandemic, and our expectation is that our net debt-to-EBITDA will begin working its way back down to 5.5% or less, based on the corporate model that I'm looking at. \u2047 Number two, we have embedded contractual growth and cash flow in our office portfolio, with approximately $24 million of in-place growth in just the office cash NOI in '21 and '22. \u2047 Number three, our same store cash -- office cash NOI came in at just 3% due to abatements that were provided to our GSA tenants at our First & Main in Portland, Oregon, as part of their lease renewal package during Q1 2020. \u2047 These abatements continued through February '21. \u2047 Absent these short-term abatements, office same store cash NOI growth in Q4 '20 compared to Q4 '19 would have been approximately 7%. \u2047 Number four, multifamily properties incurred mixed results based on their geographic locations. \u2047 For our multifamily properties located in Portland, occupancy was down 17% compared to the same quarter last year, while the weighted average monthly base rent increased approximately 1.4%. \u2047 For our multifamily properties located in San Diego, occupancy remained stable at approximately the same over the prior year, while the weighted average monthly base rent increased 7.3% over the prior year. \u2047 Of note, our occupancy levels in Portland have been trending much higher since the beginning of the year with our recent leasing momentum, bringing optimism that we will return to a more normalized pre-pandemic occupancy level. \u2047 Number five, let's talk about guidance. \u2047 As previously disclosed, we withdrew our guidance in April 2020, due to the uncertainty that the pandemic would have on our existing guidance, particularly in our mixed use and retail sectors. \u2047 Until we have a clear view of the duration of the economic impact and the economy shows signs of recovery, we will refrain from issuing formal guidance. \u2047 However, what we can do is provide you a framework on how to think about our portfolio. \u2047 We believe that Q4 '20 was close to, if not the bottom of the economic impact for us. \u2047 We have taken approximately $18 million in combined bad debt expense reserves in 2020, including turning up most of the straight line rent for which reserves have been taking. \u2047 Included in this number is approximately $7.6 million or $0.10 of bad debt expense reserves that were included in our FFO number of $0.41 for Q4 '20. \u2047 From my perspective, I believe $0.41 of FFO for Q4 '20 is the bottom. \u2047 I would suggest that you conservatively use that as a starting base. \u2047 Assume that continues for the first two quarters. \u2047 Beginning in Q3 '21, assuming most everyone in America has been vaccinated, I would expect theaters restaurants and especially Waikiki Beach Walk retail and the Embassy Suites Waikiki to begin their recovery. \u2047 I would apply some percentage growth to the $0.41 of the Q4 2020 FFO beginning in Q3 '21 and continuing into Q4 '21. \u2047 Adjustments that also would need to be made include, in Q1 '21, approximately $0.05 related to the yield maintenance make whole payment on the Series A note prepayment will be a non-recurring expense in Q1 '21. \u2047 Also in Q1 '21 through Q4 '21, the additional proceeds from the public bond offering are expected to increase our interest expense by approximately $0.03 per quarter. \u2047 As we look beyond '21, we expect to see the following. \u2047 First, we expect to see the Embassy Suites Waikiki coming back in full strength in '22, adding approximately another $0.13 of FFO. \u2047 Secondly, the Waikiki Beach Walk retail coming back in partial strength in '22, adding approximately another $0.08 of FFO. \u2047 Also, in our supplemental this quarter, we have included our estimated development yield for La Jolla Commons III, which is expected to take between 24 and 30 months to develop. \u2047 The estimated yield for this development is approximately between 6.5% and 7.5% based on the market conditions today. \u2047 We expect this project to be completed by the end of 2023. \u2047 A 6.5% yield on $175 million is approximately another $11 million of NOI or $0.14 of FFO. \u2047 In the meantime, the cash on the balance sheet earmarked for this development will be a short-term drag on earnings. \u2047 And lastly, we expect our One Beach property on the North Waterfront of San Francisco to complete its renovation by the end of 2022, and we expect this property to produce approximately $0.05 plus of FFO upon stabilization in 2023. \u2047 For now, this is our informal big picture framework of what we conservatively expect in '21. \u2047 But it is not considered or it is not to be considered as formal guidance. \u2047 As we have more clarity and conviction on the back half of '21, we will share it with you. \u2047 We will continue our best to be as transparent as possible. \u2047 At the end of the fourth quarter, net of One Beach, which is under redevelopment, our office portfolio stood at approximately 95% leased, with just under 5% expiring at the end of 2021. \u2047 Our top-10 office tenants represents 51.5% of our total office based rent. \u2047 Given the quality of our assets and the strength of the markets in which they are located, the technology and life science is the key market drivers and we continue to execute leases at favorable rental rates, delivering continued NOI growth in our office segment even in this challenging environment. \u2047 The weighted average base rent increase for the seven renewals completed during the fourth quarter was 5%. \u2047 With leases already signed, we have locked in approximately $24 million of NOI growth in our office segment, comprised of approximately $14 million in 2021 and $10 million in 2022. \u2047 We anticipate additional NOI growth in 2022 and 2023 through the redevelopments and leasing of 102,000 rentable square feet at One Beach Street in San Francisco and 33,000 rentable square feet at 710 Oregon Square in the Lloyd submarket of Portland. \u2047 With the recent entitlements for two blocks at Oregon Square in Portland, we can add up to an additional 555,000 rentable square feet to the portfolio. \u2047 However, we continue evaluating market conditions and prospective tenant interest before commencing development of that project. \u2047 In the next few months, we will commence construction of Tower 3 at La Jolla Commons, a 213,000 rentable square foot, 11 storey Class A plus office tower in the UTC submarket of San Diego. \u2047 With expected completion in Q2 or Q3 of 2023, La Jolla Commons Tower 3 will grow our office portfolio by 6.1%. \u2047 We're moving forward because we believe in the long-term fundamentals of the market, especially in UTC. \u2047 Direct vacancy remains low at 6.5% and the inventory is aging with just 26% or three out of 22 Class A office buildings being built since 2008, two of which are our own towers at La Jolla Commons. \u2047 These 3three newer towers are 97% leased. \u2047 The existing office inventory is actually shrinking due"], "gold_summary": ["q4
