{"article": ["Please visit our website at transdigm.com to obtain a supplemental slide deck and call replay information. \u2047 The company would also like to advise you that during the course of the call, we will be referring to EBITDA, specifically EBITDA as defined, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 First, I'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy and then a few comments about the quarter and a discussion of our fiscal 2022 outlook, then Jorge and Mike will give additional color on the quarter. \u2047 To reiterate, we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good and bad times, as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle. \u2047 To summarize here are some of the reasons why we believe this. \u2047 About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and over three quarters of our net sales come from products, which we believe we are the sole source provider. \u2047 Most of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket revenues, which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns. \u2047 We follow a consistent long-term strategy. \u2047 Specifically, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. \u2047 We utilize a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology. \u2047 We have a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system, closely aligned with shareholders. \u2047 Next, we acquire businesses that fit this strategy where we see a clear path to PE-like returns. \u2047 And finally, our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology. \u2047 Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. \u2047 To do this, we stay focused on both the details of value creation, as well as careful allocation of our capital. \u2047 We continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market and are encouraged by the trends in air traffic among other factors. \u2047 Our Q1 fiscal results show positive growth in comparison to the same period in fiscal 2021 as we are lapping the first quarter of 2021, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic and prior to the widespread availability of vaccines. \u2047 Although our results have improved, they continue to be unfavorably affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels as the demand for air travel remains depressed. \u2047 However, the continued improvement in global air traffic despite emergence of a new COVID-19 variant in late 2021 is encouraging, it further illustrates the pent-up demand for air travel and bodes well for the momentum of the commercial aerospace recovery in 2022. \u2047 To date, the recovery has remained primarily driven by domestic leisure travel, although we are optimistic for recovery of international travel as many governments across the world have softened travel restrictions. \u2047 Even the travel restrictions reimposed by certain governments during the months of December due to the Omicron variant are now starting to ease, which is again an encouraging sign. \u2047 In our business, we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in our commercial markets, with total commercial aftermarket revenues up 10% over Q4 of fiscal 2021 and bookings up more than 15% compared to Q4. \u2047 Commercial OEM bookings came in even stronger with almost 20% sequential improvement over Q4. \u2047 I am also very pleased that despite the challenging commercial environment, our EBITDA as defined margin was 47.3% in the quarter. \u2047 Contributing to this better-than-expected margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, as well as the careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy. \u2047 This was achieved despite the emergence of the Omicron variant during the quarter. \u2047 Additionally, we continued to generate significant cash in Q1. \u2047 We had strong operating cash flow generation of almost $280 million and closed the quarter with a little over $4.8 billion of cash. \u2047 We expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2022. \u2047 Next, an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities. \u2047 We are now at a decision point with regard to our sizable cash balance, which is now approaching $5 billion. \u2047 Consistent with our history, when we have a significant amount of cash available, we aim to get that back to the shareholders in one form or another. \u2047 At this time, we're still in the process of evaluating our capital allocation options with regard to any significant acquisitions, share buybacks and dividends. \u2047 All three options are on the table each individually, but then also potentially in some combination over the next 12 months. \u2047 Any significant M&A, share buyback and/or dividend activity will still leave the company with substantial liquidity and the financial flexibility to deal with any currently anticipated capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future. \u2047 We continue to look at possible M&A opportunities and are always attentive to our capital allocation. \u2047 Both the M&A and capital markets are always difficult to predict, but especially so in these times. \u2047 Regarding the current M&A pipeline, we are still actively looking for M&A opportunities that fit our model. \u2047 We continue to see a pickup in acquisition opportunity activity, but it's still slower than pre-COVID. \u2047 We have a decent pipeline of possibilities as usual, mostly in the small, midsized range. \u2047 I cannot predict or comment on possible closings, we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio. \u2047 Now, moving to our outlook for 2022. \u2047 We are still not in a position to provide full financial guidance as a result of the continued disruption in our primary commercial end markets. \u2047 We continue to be encouraged by the recovery we have seen in our commercial aftermarket revenues and the strong bookings received for both commercial OEM and aftermarket in Q1. \u2047 We will look to reinstitute guidance when we have a clearer picture of the future. \u2047 We continue to expect COVID-19 to have an adverse impact on our financial results compared to pre-pandemic levels throughout the remainder of fiscal 2022 under the assumption that both our commercial OEM and aftermarket customer demand will remain depressed due to lower worldwide air travel. \u2047 Although recent positive trends in commercial air traffic could impact us favorably. \u2047 To reiterate what we said on the Q4 earnings call, our teams are still planning for our commercial aftermarket revenue to grow in the 20% to 30% range. \u2047 We expect our commercial OEM revenue to grow significantly as well, but at a rate slightly less than the commercial aftermarket. \u2047 As you know, we aim to be conservative and would be happy to have both of these end markets rebound more strongly. \u2047 To reiterate, these are planning assumptions for organizational purposes and not guidance. \u2047 As for the defense market, we still expect defense revenue growth in the low single-digit percent range from fiscal 2022 versus prior year despite the slow start to the year. \u2047 Jorge will provide more color on our defense end market. \u2047 We now expect full year fiscal 2022 EBITDA margin to be slightly north of 47% due to the rate of commercial aftermarket recovery. \u2047 Please note that our Q1 EBITDA margin was stronger than anticipated, and we may see less year-over-year margin improvement for Q2 and expect margins to move up throughout the second half of the fiscal year. \u2047 As a final note, this margin guidance includes the unfavorable headwind of our Cobham acquisition of about 0.5%. \u2047 We believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2022. \u2047 As usual, we'll closely watch the aerospace and capital markets as they develop and will react accordingly. \u2047 Mike will provide details on other fiscal 2022 financial assumptions and updates. \u2047 Now, shifting gears for a moment to nonfinancial matters. \u2047 I'd like to touch on our DoD IG audit report, which was released in mid-December. \u2047 As we expected and communicated, the audit scope and results were similar to prior audits. \u2047 The report found no legal wrongdoing on behalf of TransDigm or any of our employees. \u2047 The report asked for a purely voluntary refund of approximately $21 million. \u2047 We disagree with many of the implications contained in the report, as well as the methodology used to arrive at many of the report's conclusions. \u2047 We also disagree with the use of arbitrary standards and analysis, which render many areas of the report inaccurate and misleading. \u2047 Additionally, at the request of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, we participated in a hearing on January 19 to discuss the results of the audit. \u2047 Going forward, we will continue to work with the IG, the DLA and any other relevant parties to evaluate the results of this audit. \u2047 The U.S. government and the U.S. warfighter remained top priorities for TransDigm. \u2047 At this time, we are engaged directly with the DLA and do not have any further update on whether or not we expect to pay all or a portion of the $21 million voluntary refund request. \u2047 Finally, I wanted to announce the retirement of our Vice Chairman, Bob Henderson. \u2047 He retired at the end of first fiscal quarter. \u2047 Bob has been a key member of the TransDigm management team for over 25 years and a significant partner in the company's growth during the entire period. \u2047 He served in a range of roles over his years with TransDigm, including as president of several operating units, executive vice president, COO of TransDigm's airframe business group and most recently, vice chairman, where he oversaw the integration of the operating units acquired as part of the Esterline transaction. \u2047 We wish Bob well in his retirement. \u2047 Let me conclude by stating that I'm pleased with the company's performance in this challenging time for the commercial aerospace industry and with our commitment to driving value for our stakeholders. \u2047 As always, we remain focused on executing our operating strategy and managing our cost structure as we continue on this journey to a full recovery of the commercial aerospace industry. \u2047 We look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2022 and expect that our consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you have come to expect from us. \u2047 Now, let me hand it over to Jorge to review our performance and a few other items. \u2047 I'll start with our typical review of results by key market category. \u2047 For the remainder of the call, I'll provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2021. \u2047 That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. \u2047 This market discussion includes the acquisition of Cobham aero connectivity. \u2047 We began to include Cobham in this market analysis discussion in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. \u2047 This market discussion also removes the impact of any divestitures completed in fiscal 2021. \u2047 In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket. \u2047 Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 13% in Q1 compared with the prior year period. \u2047 Bookings in the quarter were robust compared to the same prior year period and strongly outpaced sales. \u2047 Sequentially, the bookings improved almost 20% compared to Q4. \u2047 We are hopeful that the narrowbody rate ramps disclosed by Airbus and Boeing will play out as forecasted. \u2047 Now, moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion. \u2047 Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 49% in Q1 when compared with prior year period. \u2047 Growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by increased demand in our passenger submarket, although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year Q1. \u2047 Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew approximately 10% and bookings grew more than 15%. \u2047 Commercial aftermarket bookings are up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period and Q1 bookings strongly outpaced sales. \u2047 To touch on a few key points of consideration, global revenue passenger miles remained low but continued to modestly improve throughout our Q1. \u2047 IATA currently forecasts a 39% decrease in revenue passenger miles in calendar year 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Within IATA's estimate is the expectation that domestic travel will be back to 93% of pre-pandemic levels in calendar year 2022. \u2047 Despite the impact of the Omicron variant, December global revenue passenger miles still improved month on month, which demonstrates the strong underlying demand and the willingness of passengers to travel. \u2047 Countries that reimposed travel restrictions due to this variant are already announcing significant easing of those restrictions. \u2047 The limited impact from the Omicron variant on air travel provides optimism for the pace of the recovery of air traffic in 2022. \u2047 The recovery in domestic travel has been more resilient than international. \u2047 Domestic air traffic for calendar 2021 was only down 28% compared to pre-pandemic versus international, which was still down 75%. \u2047 As the commercial aerospace recovery has progressed, the U.S. and Europe have shown strong demand for domestic travel. \u2047 China has been more volatile due to its zero COVID policies, which lead to localized lockdowns and rapid drop-offs in air travel. \u2047 Though the pace of the international air traffic recovery has been slow, we are hopeful for improvement in international travel in 2022 as vaccination rates continue to improve globally and many of the government travel restrictions are softening. \u2047 Global cargo volumes continue to surpass pre-COVID levels and it is generally expected that airfreight demand will remain robust throughout 2022. \u2047 Business jet utilization remained strong. \u2047 Commentary from business jet OEMs and operators have been encouraging and these higher levels of business jet activity may be here to stay, though time will tell. \u2047 Now, let me speak about our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue. \u2047 The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, decreased by approximately 12% in Q1 when compared with the prior year period. \u2047 As we have said many times, defense sales and bookings can be lumpy. \u2047 This quarter, Cobham was lapping a very tough prior year comparison as Cobham's defense sales accelerated in fiscal Q1 2021, which was the last quarter prior to TransDigm's ownership. \u2047 This was the single largest contributor to the year-over-year decline. \u2047 There are also some supply chain-induced delays in fulfilling orders at certain operating units. \u2047 As Kevin mentioned earlier, we continue to expect low single-digit percent range growth in fiscal 2022 for our defense market revenues. \u2047 Lastly, I'd like to wrap up by stating how pleased I am by our operational performance in this first quarter of fiscal 2022, despite the continued impact of the pandemic. \u2047 We remain focused on our value drivers and executing with operational excellence. \u2047 I'm going to quickly hit on some additional financial matters for the quarter and then our expectations for the full fiscal year. \u2047 First, in regard to profitability"], "gold_summary": ["full fiscal 2022 guidance remains suspended at this time."], "pred_summary":
