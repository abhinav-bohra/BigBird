{"article": ["You can access this announcement on the Investor Relations page of our website www. \u2047 aam.com and through the PR Newswire services. \u2047 You can also find supplemental slides for this conference call on the Investor page of our website as well. \u2047 For additional information, we ask that you refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u2047 Information regarding these non-GAAP measures, as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial information is available on our website. \u2047 With that, let me turn things over to AAM's Chairman and CEO, David Dauch. \u2047 Joining me on the call today are Mike Simonte, AAM's President; and Chris May, AAM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 To begin my comments today, I'll review the highlights of our second quarter 2021 financial results. \u2047 Next, I'll touch on some exciting business development news in the quarter, including announcements with the Chinese EV OEM deal and our recent communication about GM's Oshawa plant. \u2047 And lastly, we'll discuss the ongoing and unprecedented challenges within the supply chain and our financial outlook. \u2047 After Chris covered the details of our financial results, we will then open up the call for any questions that you may have. \u2047 AAM delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter of 2021 navigating industry production volatility stemming from the continuity of supply challenges. \u2047 These challenges were greater than we originally anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, but our team did an excellent job in managing these obstacles resulting in solid financial results. \u2047 AAM sales for the second quarter 2021, were $1.28 billion, up approximately 149% compared to $515 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 The increase in our revenues on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects the recovery from COVID-19 related industry shutdowns that we experienced last year. \u2047 North American industry production was up approximately 130% according to third party estimates. \u2047 Light truck production was up 150% year-over-year. \u2047 And volumes of our core platforms increased significantly year-over-year. \u2047 Inventory levels on key light truck programs that we support remain well below normal levels. \u2047 Consumer demand for light trucks remains robust and our OEM customers are building them as fast as possible. \u2047 We believe the demand environment for these products, combined with the lack of inventory should lead to an extended recovery through 2022 which will certainly benefit AAM. \u2047 AAM's adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2021 was $222.6 million or 17.3% of sales. \u2047 This compares to a loss of $52.1 million last year. \u2047 In addition to benefiting from higher production levels, our intense focus on optimizing the business and flexing our cost structure over the past several quarters greatly contributed to our performance in the quarter. \u2047 We remain committed to driving efficiency and managing factors underneath our control. \u2047 AAM's adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 was $0.29 per share compared to a loss of $1.79 in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 And as for cash, I'm very excited about our cash flow generation in the quarter. \u2047 We generated adjusted free cash flow of over $136 million compared to an outflow of approximately $162 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Our operating performance and commitment to efficient capital spending drove this high level of free cash flow. \u2047 Additionally, we prepaid over $140 million of term loans in the second quarter. \u2047 And since the fourth quarter of 2020, to the second quarter 2021, we have paid down approximately $360 million of long-term debt. \u2047 As we previously stated, we are committed to reducing our debt and strengthen our balance sheet this year. \u2047 We are delivering on that goal. \u2047 We achieved 2.5 times net leverage ratio in the second quarter. \u2047 It is this management team's focus to further strengthen AAM's balance sheet. \u2047 On the business front, we are very excited to announce that we will be supplying electric vehicle components to NIO, supporting their next generation of e-Powertrain program. \u2047 And for those of you who don't know who NIO is, NIO is a leading Chinese electric vehicle OEM and a pioneer in China \u2047 s electric vehicle market. \u2047 We continue to see good growth opportunities to support electric vehicles with drive units and a wide range of sub-assemblies and components. \u2047 This applies with both existing and new customers. \u2047 Today's announcement clearly underscores AAM \u2047 s technology in electric vehicle propulsion and our commitment to excellence within this space. \u2047 We are very eager to support this new customer. \u2047 Electrification dialog with multiple global OEMs continues to be very constructive as manufacturers are intensely focused to support this transformation. \u2047 We see plenty of opportunities over the next several years as our state-of-the-art technology, engineering, compact design and new product offerings are attracting strong global interest. \u2047 Our engineering teams are rapidly developing next-generation technology, while supporting the launch of multiple new electrification programs globally. \u2047 Our technology, innovation, and focus on customer service, our strong value propositions, allowing OEMs to compete to win business with both traditional and start up OEMs. It's our goal to be the supplier of choice when it comes to the electric drive units, sub-assemblies and components. \u2047 Clearly, these are very exciting times for AAM. \u2047 Having said that, we continue to deliver on our theme of securing the future by protecting the core. \u2047 We are very pleased to reiterate that AAM will be the sole supplier of front, rear pick-up axles for the production at GM's Oshawa facility. \u2047 This development demonstrates our high quality products and on-time delivery capabilities, as well as our strong relationship with General Motors. \u2047 We look forward to supporting GM as they expand their production of the successful full-sized trucks to meet consumer demand and rebuild their inventories. \u2047 In the quarter, we completed an acquisition which specializes in producing powdered metal components. \u2047 And as we mentioned before, we will do smart, quick-return, bolt-on acquisitions that will complement our core business, drive synergies, and provide solid financial returns. \u2047 This was a compelling high value purchase which should immediately benefit AAM as also part of our long-term lightweighting component strategy. \u2047 Finally, we are recognized as GM overdrive award winner in 2020. \u2047 We are very grateful for this award as it demonstrates our commitment to the continuity of supply, while addressing an unfortunate industrial fire last year. \u2047 Operational excellence is a core value for AAM and will certainly benefit us and provide us the competitive advantage going forward. \u2047 Before I transition to Chris, I want to talk about our current operating environment and our financial guidance. \u2047 The stress on the value chain stemming from shortages and semiconductors, labor, steel, shipping containers, port delays, and rising commodity prices is unprecedented. \u2047 Second quarter 2021 was a challenging environment with the semiconductor challenges causing the production volatility that we saw in our schedules. \u2047 These headwinds are continuing and schedules will remain volatile. \u2047 We believe the second quarter 2021 still to be the trough of this issue and the semiconductor availability to improve in the second half of the year. \u2047 However, we expect supply chain challenges related to this and other constraints to continue into 2022. \u2047 For AAM, we will continue to work diligently with our customers and our extended supply base to protect continuity of supply and support our customers. \u2047 Let's discuss our financial guidance. \u2047 Although there is continued operating uncertainty, especially with the availability of semiconductors, we are maintaining our guidance for revenue and raising the low end of our EBITDA range. \u2047 We are also raising our adjusted free cash flow outlook. \u2047 Our guidance is as follows. \u2047 Our revenue will be $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA $875 million to $925 million. \u2047 And adjusted free cash flow of $350 million to $425 million. \u2047 Aside from the impact of the semiconductor issue and metal market challenges, operationally, our business is running very, very well. \u2047 We are focused on managing our costs and expenses, while ensuring operational and capital efficiency to optimize our business. \u2047 And as I've mentioned before, these fundamentals should support strong margin opportunities as we return to normal operating conditions. \u2047 At AAM, we have two over achieving priorities and both are equally important. \u2047 First, we're focused on the here and the now. \u2047 That means operational excellence, strong cost management, and an unwavering commitment to support our customers. \u2047 We have continued to demonstrate these qualities and manage factors that we can control, leading to strong free cash flow generation, and yes, a stronger balance sheet. \u2047 Second, we're focused on our future. \u2047 We will continue to make investments in R&D to develop the next generation of electrified products and lightweighting of components to drive profitable future growth. \u2047 Our engineering teams are developing creative solutions to offer solid value propositions to our customers. \u2047 This is demonstrated by a high interest in our electric vehicle products. \u2047 And for us, our breadth and depth in drive chains provides us with a competitive advantage in not only technology development, but also an understanding of the OEMs, what the OEMs want from the propulsion system. \u2047 Clearly these are very exciting times and the future is very bright for AAM. \u2047 And with that, let me turn things over to Chris May. \u2047 I will cover the financial details of our second quarter results with you today. \u2047 I will also refer to the earnings slide deck as part of my prepared comments. \u2047 So, let's go ahead and begin with sales. \u2047 In the second quarter of 2021 AAM sales were $1.28 billion compared to $515 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Slide seven, shows a walk of second quarter 2020 sales to second quarter 2021 sales. \u2047 First, we add back the impact of COVID-19 from second quarter of 2020 of approximately $947 million. \u2047 Then, we account for the unfavorable impact of the semiconductor shortage which we estimate to be approximately $162 million in the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Other volume mix and pricing was negative by $99 million. \u2047 Metals and FX accounted for an increase in sales of $82 million. \u2047 During the last several quarters, we have continued to see an increase in the primary index related inputs to metal-based materials that we purchase. \u2047 You may recall, we hedged this risk with our customers by passing through the majority of index related changes. \u2047 The metal portion of this column reflects those elevated pass-throughs on a year-over-year comparison. \u2047 Now, let's move on to profitability. \u2047 Gross profit was $190 million or 14.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a loss of $99 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $222.6 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 17.3% of sales. \u2047 This compares to a loss of $52.1 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 You could see a year-over-year walk down of adjusted EBITDA on slide eight. \u2047 We benefited from the contribution margin on the increase in net sales from last year as we continued to experience positive improvements in performance. \u2047 As a result, the short notice production schedule changes and receipt of long lead inventory items such as steel, our raw, whipped, and finished goods inventories increased in this quarter. \u2047 This drove a $16 million benefit from inventory absorption timing, which should reverse out in the second half of the year as we anticipate reducing inventories during that timeframe. \u2047 As we mentioned, throughout the quarter, our schedules were more volatile than expected, but we were able to close the latter part of the quarter on a strong note. \u2047 Now, let me cover SG&A. \u2047 SG&A expense including R&D in the first quarter of 2021 was $86 million or 6.7% of sales. \u2047 This compares to 14.3% of sales in the second quarter of 2020 as revenues rapidly declined last year due to COVID-19 related shutdowns. \u2047 AAM's R&D spending in the second quarter of 2021 was $30 million compared to $32 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 We will continue to focus on controlling our SG&A costs, while at the same time, continue to invest in key technologies and innovations, with an emphasis on electrification. \u2047 This emphasis includes an appropriate level of funding to be successful and meet our objectives, but also include, smartly utilizing current resources from traditional products to support new technology development in a cost effective manner. \u2047 We do expect R&D to increase in the second half of the year as we are positioning to launch and pursue more electric vehicle business. \u2047 We continue to experience significant customer interest in our new products and technology. \u2047 Now, let's move on to interest and taxes. \u2047 Net interest expense was $47.3 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $51.6 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 We expect this favorable trend to continue as we benefit from continued debt reduction. \u2047 In the second quarter of 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $2.4 million compared to a benefit of $43.9 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 As we continue into 2021, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 15% to 20%. \u2047 We would expect cash taxes to be in the $30 million to $40 million range. \u2047 Taking all these sales and cost drivers into account, our GAAP net income was $16 million or $0.13 per share in the second quarter of 2021, compared to a loss of $213.2 million or a loss of $1.88 per share in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Let's now move to cash flow and the balance sheet. \u2047 Net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2021 was $167.1 million compared to an outflow of $142.5 million last year. \u2047 Capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from the sale of property plant equipment for the second quarter of 2021 was $41 million. \u2047 Cash payments for restructuring acquisition-related activity for the second quarter of 2021 were $16 million. \u2047 The net cash inflow related to the recovery from the Malvern fire we experienced in September of 2020 was $5 million in the quarter. \u2047 However, we anticipate the Malvern fire to have a neutral cash impact for the full year as the timing of cash expenditures and cash insurance proceeds align over time. \u2047 In total, we would expect $50 million to $65 million in restructuring and acquisition costs in 2021. \u2047 This is no change from prior guidance. \u2047 Reflecting the impact of this activity, AAM generated adjusted free cash flow of $136.1 million in the second quarter of 2021."], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share of $0.13.  \u2047  q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.29.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.13.  \u2047  q2 sales
