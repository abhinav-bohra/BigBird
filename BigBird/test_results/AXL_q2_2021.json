financial measures were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \u2047 These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. \u2047 This was another excellent quarter, and I'm extremely proud of the entire SentinelOne team. \u2047 Our ARR growth accelerated to 131% year over year in the third quarter, our third consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. \u2047 We continue to scale our business on the back of leading endpoint protection, machine speed DDR, XDR innovation, and our powerful partner-supported go-to-market strategy. \u2047 The demand environment remains incredibly strong. \u2047 Before digging deeper into the details of our quarterly performance and results, I'd like to share some perspectives on the cybersecurity landscape. \u2047 I'd encourage you all to also look at our shareholder letter we have on our Investor Relations website, which provides a lot more detail. \u2047 We're still early in the generational shift in cybersecurity led by the ongoing digital transformation of the enterprise. \u2047 There are millions of cyberattacks inflicting trillions of dollars in damages every year. \u2047 This is unacceptable and a growing risk to enterprises across the world. \u2047 The increasing number of attacks and sophistication clearly shows that enterprises must deploy best-of-breed solutions that enable them to stay one step ahead of attackers. \u2047 Take the current state of ransomware. \u2047 Attackers have shifted from simply holding operations hostage to actual data compromise and infiltration, infiltrating both legacy and unprotected devices. \u2047 That's where SentinelOne comes in. \u2047 We pioneered the world's first purpose-built, AI-powered XDR platform to make cybersecurity defense truly autonomous from the endpoint and beyond. \u2047 We believe it's essential to protect all parts of the enterprise estate, such as unknown devices, cloud workloads, and the data itself. \u2047 We focus on data to provide enhanced visibility and advanced analytics. \u2047 We protect our customers in real-time at machine speed, empowering human operators with the speed, scale, and precision of technology. \u2047 Our approach is resonating with our customers. \u2047 We received the highest overall rating in the 2021 Gartner Voice of the Customer Report for endpoint protection platforms where 97% of reviewers would recommend the SentinelOne Singularity XDR platform. \u2047 I'm very proud of the work we all do to keep our customers secure, engaged, and delighted. \u2047 We focus on putting our customers first. \u2047 Let's turn the discussion to how we're executing. \u2047 During our IPO earlier this year, we outlined five key aspects to our growth strategy. \u2047 Our third quarter results demonstrate success and progress against each of these. \u2047 First, we continue to innovate and enhance our cybersecurity and data platform. \u2047 Automation is a top priority for SentinelOne. \u2047 Machine speed automation can help counter instantaneous cyberattacks and enable under-resourced IT teams. \u2047 Last quarter, we introduced Storyline Active Response, or STAR, for customized dynamic detection and response rules. \u2047 This quarter, we began offering Remote Script Orchestration, or RSO, to instantly investigate and triage threats on multiple endpoints across entire organizations remotely. \u2047 Together, these two capabilities deliver increased level of automation, as well as help enterprises, consolidate legacy workflows in tooling with the Singularity XDR platform. \u2047 I want to dig more deeply into RSO. \u2047 We designed RSO to transform endpoint management for incidence response providers and enterprises. \u2047 We're offering complete remote control and orchestration across endpoints. \u2047 It's a scalable way for security providers to not only detect and respond with existing endpoints but also manage and control the entire deployed footprint. \u2047 It's like having a security analyst on every single endpoint at all times. \u2047 Our customers and partners are already realizing the benefits of the advanced capabilities of RSO. \u2047 One of our incident response partners said RSO helps eliminate time-consuming efforts to collect and consolidate forensics data in rapidly contained attacks, enabling us to minimize adversary impact. \u2047 On the customer side, a Fortune 500 wholesale company added RSO to help ultimate threat hunting capabilities, making SentinelOne more powerful and integral to their security posture. \u2047 In addition to automation, we believe a true XDR platform must be a comprehensive and open platform that provides visibility, protection, and response across the entire enterprise landscape. \u2047 Customers have been asking us to provide mobile protection to complement our leading protection capabilities. \u2047 And just this week, we announced Singularity Mobile. \u2047 SentinelOne customers can now manage mobile device security alongside endpoint, cloud workloads, and IoT devices. \u2047 Singularity Mobile brings behavioral AI-driven machine speed protection, detection and responds directly to iOS, Android, and Chrome OS devices. \u2047 Putting this all together, we were recently recognized as a strong performer in the Forrester New Wave Extended Detection and Response Providers report. \u2047 Forrester highlighted that SentinelOne Singularity XDR platform is the best fit for companies that want customizability and to grow into XDR. We were also named Best Innovator in SE Labs' Annual Report. \u2047 The second part of our strategy is to protect more enterprises every day. \u2047 In Q3, our ARR grew by 131% year over year, and our revenue was up 128%. \u2047 Our business is performing exceptionally well. \u2047 We added over 600 new customers sequentially. \u2047 We grew our total customer count by over 75% to over 6,000 compared to a year ago. \u2047 Customers with ARR over $100,000 grew 140%, and we continue to see a growing mix of large enterprises within our business. \u2047 In addition to expanding our global presence through direct sales teams, our channel remains a source of scalable growth and differentiation. \u2047 With our partner-friendly approach, we're succeeding by further expanding our scale with incidence response in managed security service provider partners. \u2047 Nick will touch on this in more detail later on. \u2047 Third, we're unlocking further product adoption within our existing customer base. \u2047 In the fiscal third quarter, our net retention rate reached 130%, a new record for our company. \u2047 This growth was driven by strong license expansion, platform upgrades, and customer adoption of our new capabilities. \u2047 We're early in our module strategy, but we're seeing great customer interest and adoption. \u2047 Our emerging products such as Ranger IoT, cloud workload protection, and data capabilities are all growing at impressive triple-digit rates. \u2047 In particular, our cloud workload protection product delivered the highest growth during the quarter, a testament to the demand for our real-time run-time protection for cloud workloads and containerized environments. \u2047 In one case, a leading book publisher selected SentinelOne for cloud workload protection because of its ease of use, simplicity of deployment, and having a true EDR in one console to manage their cloud-native Windows, Linux, and Kubernetes environments. \u2047 The fourth element of our growth strategy is to further expand our global footprint. \u2047 Revenue from international markets grew 159% year over year. \u2047 International markets now represent 33% of our total revenue, up from 29% a year ago. \u2047 As an example, in Q3, we secured a European conglomerate by replacing over 20 different antivirus products. \u2047 This shows how our platform can help with vendor consolidation while also delivering leading performance. \u2047 We're growing our sales coverage and channel presence in international markets. \u2047 Last quarter, we talked about opening a new R&D center in the Czech Republic, and I'm excited that we're hiring great talent in this region. \u2047 These initiatives will continue to strengthen our international presence. \u2047 Fifth and last, we're well-positioned to expand our total addressable market through both acquisitions and strategic investments. \u2047 We further strengthened our leadership team with the appointment of Rob Salvagno to lead Corporate Development. \u2047 As we consider acquisitions, we evaluate prospects that align with our product, customer, and strategic market opportunities. \u2047 Over time, we intend to use these opportunities to extend the reach of our XDR platform into adjacencies that complement our offerings. \u2047 Our strategy also involves making minority investments. \u2047 We recently made two strategic investments in early funding rounds for Laminar and Torq, companies that align with our approach to automation and APIs. \u2047 Investments in emerging technologies will allow us to constantly enhance the SentinelOne platform in areas that may be of future interest to us. \u2047 These investments reflect our long-term commitment to innovation, automation, and securing data wherever it resides with a front-row seat into cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies. \u2047 Finally, as part of our XDR road map, Scalyr is performing extremely well and has continued to grow year over year and quarter over quarter. \u2047 At the same time, we're onboarding all new customers on our revamped back end seamlessly. \u2047 We've begun migrating select existing customers. \u2047 By using Scalyr, our customers are enjoying faster performance and advanced analytics capabilities. \u2047 Our true competitive advantage comes from the employees of SentinelOne. \u2047 We've invested in talent across sales, marketing, engineering, and corporate functions while cultivating an inclusive and diverse workplace. \u2047 We've grown rapidly in the past year, and our number of employees has gone from 600 to about 1,100. \u2047 This has been no small feat, and we're continuing to grow and expanding the team. \u2047 We work very hard to foster a productive and inclusive culture, and our efforts are showing up in results. \u2047 As part of the 2021 Great Places to Work certification, 96% of responses from employees said SentinelOne is a great place to work. \u2047 We received several other awards during the quarter that recognize our workplace culture. \u2047 With the combination of our differentiated technology and dedicated team, we're helping our customers stay ahead of adversaries, prevent breaches, and autonomously respond to innovation. \u2047 We're helping our customers reimagine cybersecurity. \u2047 I'm excited about what we can do from here. \u2047 Our go-to-market flywheel of sales and marketing, channel, and technology partners resulted in another outstanding quarterly performance across the board. \u2047 Strong demand for our Singularity XDR platform is evident by our third quarter results. \u2047 Our customers are clearly choosing SentinelOne as a partner and technology of choice. \u2047 In Q3, we reported an impressive ARR growth of 131%, reaching $237 million compared to last year. \u2047 This growth was driven by a healthy combination of new customer additions, existing customer renewals, and upsells. \u2047 Today, we are protecting over 6,000 customers through our Singularity XDR platform. \u2047 That's total customer growth of more than 75% or almost 2,500 more customers compared to last year. \u2047 Our focus on automation, speed, and accuracy is critical to any enterprise, in fact, all enterprises. \u2047 I want to be clear. \u2047 This is a competitive market. \u2047 The environment has not changed, yet we've maintained incredibly strong win rates in all competitive situations against legacy and next-gen vendors. \u2047 With every new quarter, we're protecting more and more mission-critical businesses around the world. \u2047 In Q3, we added a leading global financial exchange in a seven-figure multiyear agreement. \u2047 This was a true platform win. \u2047 They selected SentinelOne for endpoints, cloud workload protection, remote script orchestration, and data applications. \u2047 It's telling that we're getting so much attention by our competitors, which speaks to the traction we're having in the market. \u2047 We're winning more and more customers, and our growth rates speak for themselves. \u2047 What enterprises need is automated security, not repackaged legacy AV and crowd-powered protection. \u2047 Our mission is to elevate security for our customers through a relentless focus on innovation. \u2047 And our customers are happy with 97% gross retention rate and the highest score in Gartner's Voice of the Customer survey. \u2047 That's hundreds of customer reviews, and that speaks volumes compared to any single customer example. \u2047 Let me take a step back and share some details around our customer and business mix. \u2047 We grew customers with ARR over $100,000 by 140% versus last year. \u2047 Our business mix from customers with ARR over $100,000 continues to grow driven by our success with larger enterprises, strategic channel partners, and increasing module adoption. \u2047 In addition to protecting new larger customers, we're seeing strong retention and expansion within our existing customer base. \u2047 Gross retention rates remained consistent with prior quarters. \u2047 Our net retention rate was 130% this quarter, a new record for our company. \u2047 This record NRR was driven by license expansion, platform tier upsells, and adoption of emerging capabilities. \u2047 In Q3, two of our Fortune 10 customers renewed with multiyear deals, and both expanded their use of the Singularity platform, adding modules such as Ranger and Remote Script Orchestration. \u2047 I'd like to talk more about our channel partners. \u2047 Our partner ecosystem helps magnify our market access and significantly extends our reach and efficiency. \u2047 We do not compete with our partners. \u2047 Instead, we equip them with industry-leading capabilities like multi-tenancy and open APIs. \u2047 In fact, we're expanding our partner ecosystem, and this is driving significant growth for us. \u2047 Let me double click on our managed security service provider partnerships as an example. \u2047 MSSPs provide outsourced monitoring and management of security devices and systems. \u2047 Our growing and highly scalable partnerships with MSSPs give us robust mid-market and large enterprise coverage. \u2047 Together, we have fueled significant new customer and business growth over the past several quarters. \u2047 We're proud to partner with companies like N-able, AT&T, Pax8, Continuum, Kroll, and many others. \u2047 To demonstrate the momentum we're seeing, in our third fiscal quarter, ARR from our MSSP channel increased by 300% year over year. \u2047 In addition to MSSPs, our incident response partners leverage the SentinelOne platform for their breach response services, making us an integral part of their capabilities. \u2047 Last quarter, we talked about our commitment to support even more IR partners through our Singularity platform. \u2047 In Q3, we built upon that progress and further expanded our network of IR partners. \u2047 We added KPMG as a global go-to-market partner for incident response and proactive cybersecurity services. \u2047 Our growing network of IR partners continues to help secure businesses. \u2047 As an example, during the quarter, we won a large airline customer in Asia through one of our IR partners. \u2047 Finally, I'd like to share how we're putting our customers and partners first. \u2047 We recently hosted our first-ever customer conference called OneUP. \u2047 Participation and response has been incredibly positive. \u2047 We've also hosted partner conferences throughout the Americas and EMEA. \u2047 Our goal is to educate on our latest innovations and continue to build on our momentum. \u2047 Over the last few quarters, we've also received great feedback on our accreditation programs. \u2047 We added continuing education courses"], "gold_summary": ["q3 revenue rose 128 percent to $56 million.  \u2047  qtrly
