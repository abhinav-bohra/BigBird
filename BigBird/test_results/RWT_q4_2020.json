A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our fourth quarter Redwood Review available on our website. \u2047 Also note that the content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. \u2047 The company does not intend and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. \u2047 Finally, today's call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website later today. \u2047 As I reflected on the past year, it's hard to contextualize what our country has been through in the opening weeks of 2021, let alone all of 2020. \u2047 With unprecedented turmoil in Washington, an economy still rocked by the coronavirus pandemic, now seemingly populist revolt under way on Wall Street, it's hard for any investor to navigate all the tumult and volatility. \u2047 So we feel all the more fortunate to have emerged from such an unprecedented year in a renewed position of strength. \u2047 It's motivated us to make 2021 the best year in our company's history. \u2047 We exited 2020 with momentum building across both of our platforms, including record lock volumes in residential lending and very strong originations and contribution from business purpose lending. \u2047 GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.42 per share, well in excess of our $0.14 per share dividend, and our GAAP book value increased $0.50 per share from the third quarter to $9.91 in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Based on the trajectory of our operating businesses and our expectations for sustainably higher net interest income throughout the year, we are confident that we can safely support a stable to growing dividend in 2021. \u2047 We plan to announce our first quarter dividend in March. \u2047 Looking ahead, our strategic priorities for 2021 include allocating ample capital to our residential consumer and business purpose lending platforms, doubling down on our technology investments to scale our business and continuing to support and develop our team members. \u2047 Strategically speaking, the COVID-19 pandemic has only further validated our core investment thesis, as demand for single-family detached housing has grown significantly. \u2047 We expect much of that demand to be durable, as families choose to move away from dense urban areas, and more people are able to work remotely out of their homes regardless of proximity to the workplace. \u2047 This has already caused ripple effects across both the residential and commercial property sectors, especially in major metropolitan areas. \u2047 That's why our primary focus for 2021 will remain on our operating platforms. \u2047 The operating capital we allocate to these businesses is expected to generate returns on equity north of 20% post tax levels very difficult to come by when sourcing third-party investments in today's compressed yield environment. \u2047 Most importantly, these businesses serve large and growing markets not covered by government lending programs, and as such are positioned to generate scalable and repeatable sources of future earnings, even in a less accommodative interest rate environment. \u2047 Since they are earned within our taxable subsidiaries, the earnings generated can also be retained to provide a steady stream of internally sourced investment capital that can be deployed to further grow earnings and book value. \u2047 Turning to our investment portfolio, our portfolio remains a strategic element of our business model, so that supports our operating platforms and third-party investing activities. \u2047 Overall credit performance of the book remained strong as delinquencies have continued to decrease since their peak in the summer and strong home price appreciation has kept the actual credit losses low. \u2047 This means that, even if we retrace back to \"preCOVID-19\" valuations, we continue to expect significant further upside in these investments. \u2047 Coupled with positive credit trends, high prepayment speeds have begun to unlock additional value on most of our credit investments held at a discount to par. \u2047 And to channel the late Yogi Berra, I'll remind everybody that \"loans that prepay, don't default. \u2047 On the technology front, speed and disruption are top of mind in 2021 across the Redwood enterprise. \u2047 The goal is not simply to grow volume or issue more securitizations. \u2047 We aim to fundamentally change how the non-Agency sector operates, from end-to-end. \u2047 That entails more speed and automation, and keeping technology at the forefront of our planning process. \u2047 In the past several months, we have launched several new technology initiatives through both organic and new venture investment strategies. \u2047 And just today, we are announcing the recent launch of RWT Horizons, a new venture investing strategy focused on early stage technology companies with business plan squarely focused on innovations that can disrupt the mortgage finance landscape. \u2047 The amount of capital deployed through this new platform will likely be smaller at first, however, the investments are designed to have an outsized impact on how our business operates. \u2047 Our strategy centers on creating new efficiencies across the mortgage value chain, thereby making us a more meaningful partner to the broad network of market constituents to whom we provide liquidity. \u2047 Paramount to our success are our people and the core values by which we conduct our business. \u2047 Caring for our employees has never been as important, as we continue to support our team members and their families through the impacts of COVID-19. \u2047 Investments in our employee programs and stewardship of our culture remain strategic priorities, and we're proud of the work that we've done to engage, develop and retain our workforce over such a challenging year. \u2047 We stand behind our core values, including an earnest focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, and a commitment to strong corporate citizenship, both socially and environmentally. \u2047 Our commitment to our larger communities through volunteerism and charitable giving have also remained in sharp focus for us, particularly as our shared humanity has been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We believe our strategy will enable us to scale our business and take market share, grow durable and repeatable earnings and serve our mission to help make quality housing whether rented our owned, accessible to all Americans. \u2047 With optimism on the horizon for 2021, we're looking forward to the positive impact that Redwood can make for our collective stakeholders, including our shareholders, our employees and our communities. \u2047 With record performances from our operating businesses during the second half of 2020, we entered 2021 in a position of strength. \u2047 Our fourth quarter results reflect continued improvement in the broader credit markets, the depth and breadth of our competitive advantages and opportunities for our business to further build market share and growing segments of housing finance. \u2047 Our crisp execution during the quarter was supported by progress on key technology initiatives and increased efficiency in turning our capital. \u2047 Before getting into our results, I will further discuss some of the key housing industry trends we are observing. \u2047 The theme as we saw in the third quarter have continued and tailwinds for our operating businesses remain strong. \u2047 Secular trends driving single-family housing demand do not appear to be abating. \u2047 Even with the promise of a vaccine, consumers are embracing the flexibility of the work-from-home model, detethering them from urban centers and creating a substantial pocket of fresh demand for housing. \u2047 The need for space and functionality to conduct business in private homes has driven higher home values at all price points, in turn fueling the potential for expansion in both the owner occupied and an investor-owned segments of the market. \u2047 Home price appreciation continues at pace as demand for single-family homes as far outstripping supply. \u2047 Market observers estimate that US housing stock and a total of $2.5 trillion in value in 2020, including $2.2 trillion from appreciation and existing homes. \u2047 Nationwide home prices were up over 10% year-on-year in December. \u2047 And while the number of homes sold rose over 20%, inventory available for sale fell over 40%. \u2047 Resale inventories at its tightest level ever in many top markets and on average stands at less than two months of supply. \u2047 Once more mortgage rates have remained at or near record lows, even as 10-year treasury rates now stand more than 25 basis points higher than in late December. \u2047 And while the pandemic continues to impact certain segments of the labor market in different ways, the personal savings rate at year end was up 90% from the end of 2019. \u2047 As such, a key outcome of Fed stimulus has been meaningful upward pressure on bank deposit levels, a phenomenon that among other things has important ramifications for bank appetite for assets. \u2047 This data coupled with the demand trends we are seeing for our products and the performance of our portfolio makes us optimistic about our immediate and long-term opportunities for growth. \u2047 In many ways, we will measure our success in 2021 by the velocity with which we enter 2022. \u2047 We believe our competitive positioning, commitment to technology solutions and deep client base will allow our businesses to operate at a steadily increasing capacity as the year progresses. \u2047 Now I'll turn to some key metrics from the fourth quarter. \u2047 Sparkling results from our residential and BPL platforms coupled with strong performance in our investment portfolio drove a 20% annualized return on equity for the quarter. \u2047 In our residential business, we recorded a record $3.8 billion of locks with over 90 discrete sellers, up 81% from the third quarter. \u2047 Loan purchase commitments, those adjusted for potential pipeline fallout during the quarter were $2.5 billion, more than double the amount in the third quarter. \u2047 Momentum has continued into 2021, as January locks totaled $1.6 billion. \u2047 The vast majority of our locks continue to be select loans, which are reflecting some of the strongest credit metrics we have seen since the great financial crisis. \u2047 Including average FICOs in the high-700s and debt ratios of 30% or lower. \u2047 These record volumes were well balanced by our multi-channel distribution model. \u2047 During the quarter, we achieved strong execution on two securitizations backed by $669 million of loans in aggregate, including a $345 million single-investor securitization placed with an insurance company. \u2047 We also sold over $800 million of loans during the fourth quarter and entered into agreements to sell forward an additional $1 billion, expected to settle in the coming weeks. \u2047 We believe that in 2021, we will see a pronounced increase in consumer demand for jumbo loans, and that we are in the early stages of historically significant refinancing wave. \u2047 With rates remaining low, we are seeing our seller network continue to hire additional loan officers to support pent-up demand in the jumbo pipeline and an increase in participation in our seller training sessions. \u2047 In December, we officially launched a new seller initiative, Redwood Rapid Funding, demand has exceeded our expectations. \u2047 And as of January 31st, we had funded nearly $120 million of loans through the program. \u2047 We are in the process of onboarding several more sellers as we transition from the pilot phase into a more formal program for a broader set of our clients. \u2047 Additionally, we recently launched the pilot phase of Redwood Live, an app-based tool designed to give our sellers visibility into the underwriting process with live status updates for each of their loans. \u2047 Also during the fourth quarter, we launched a new initiative to modernize our workflow on the Capital Markets' desk, which will include an end-to-end solution for accessing, reporting and analyzing standardized loan level data for our Sequoia securitizations. \u2047 This platform will provide secure real-time data and transparency on the underlying loan performance within our existing securitizations and a portal for potential investors during the marketing period. \u2047 In the coming months, we look forward to sharing more on these and other new programs, including the automation of certain portions of our underwriting process. \u2047 Turning to CoreVest, our investment thesis for entering the business purpose lending segment continues to be supported by origination growth and clean credit performance. \u2047 CoreVest continues to post truly differentiated operating results, fueled by growing consumer demand for single-family homes for rent and institutional investor appetite for the asset class. \u2047 We originated $448 million in BPL loans during the quarter, up 71% from the third quarter. \u2047 Almost 80% of this production was in single-family rental loans, for which demand from the securitization markets remains a highlight. \u2047 We completed two securitizations in the fourth quarter, including an innovative single-investor transaction placed with a leading insurance company. \u2047 Our broadly distributed deal was backed by $274 million of SFR loans and was particularly well received by the market. \u2047 Certificates placed with third-party investors represented 91% of the capital structure with the weighted average yield of 1.48%. \u2047 This was 20 basis point improvement upon the already strong execution of our previous issuance. \u2047 The single-investor securitization provides $200 million in financing for SFR loans, and includes a unique ramp up feature that enhances capital efficiency and reduces our reliance on traditional warehouse funding. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we distributed $60 million in SFR loans into the structure and expect to complete the ramp up later this month. \u2047 We intend to pursue similar deals in 2021, which would accelerate our ability to grow the business with more efficient use of capital and reduced market risk. \u2047 Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we called one of our previously issued SFR securitizations, which has $75 million of outstanding loans, the majority of these loans have either been refinanced or resecuritized, and the call allowed us to recycle our capital at a significantly improved cost of funds. \u2047 Our BPL borrowers are encouraged by the resilience of tenant performance this past year, and continue to raise additional capital to expand their portfolios. \u2047 Importantly, we continue to believe that there is a deep group of potential borrowers, many of which are seasoned real estate investors that remains unserved by these types of lending products. \u2047 The tailwinds that fueled our residential and BPL businesses have also positively impacted our investment portfolio. \u2047 During the quarter, the fair value of our securities book increased approximately 3%, supported by of our securities book increased approximately 3%, supported by continued improvement in credit spreads and strength in underlying credit performance. \u2047 Overall, 90-plus day delinquencies in our securitized portfolios across both jumbo and SFR are now below 2%. \u2047 Additionally, elevated prepayment speeds are accelerating our ability to unlock the value of many of our subordinate bonds. \u2047 The majority of which we have the right to call at specified dates or once the underlying pools pay down to a certain size. \u2047 These call rights are generally at par reflecting a discount to our current estimate of the fair value of the underlying loans. \u2047 In total, the net discount on our securities portfolio as of year-end was well in excess of $400 million. \u2047 And while expected losses will to an extent influence its full realization, this discount reflects substantial potential upside to book value. \u2047 All in all,"], "gold_summary": ["q4 gaap earnings per share $0.42.  \u2047  gaap book value per common share was $9.91 at december 31, 2020."],
