{"article": ["Let me start out by saying Q4 was another very good quarter for us with all four business segments exceeding same quarter prior year revenue, adjusted EBITDA and margin. \u2047 2019 was a solid year for development growth for the company. \u2047 We added a new 60-bed rehabilitation hospital in partnership with the University of Florida Health System in Gainesville, induced 60-bed rehabilitation hospital in partnership with Dignity in Las Vegas and a new 30-bed rehabilitation hospital with partners in New Orleans. \u2047 We also relocated our rehabilitation hospital in Newport News, Virginia that we operate in partnership with Riverside Health into a new 50-bed hospital. \u2047 In addition, we acquired four critical illness recovery hospitals in two separate transactions and added additional critical illness recovery hospital through a joint venture partnership. \u2047 We also increased our portfolio of outpatient rehab clinics by 78 clinics during the year and in 2019 with 1,740 clinics under our management. \u2047 During 2019, we completed the integration of U.S. HealthWorks into our Concentra business and have fully captured the synergies we outlined when we acquired the business in early 2018. \u2047 Let me now take you through our operational metrics for the fourth quarter and the full year. \u2047 Overall, our net revenue in the fourth quarter increased 8.7% to $1.37 billion. \u2047 For the full year, net revenue increased 7.3% to $5.45 billion. \u2047 Net revenue in our critical illness recovery hospital segment in the fourth quarter increased 6.7% to $455 million. \u2047 The increase was driven by both an increase in volume and rate with patient days up 5.2% compared to the same quarter last year and revenue per patient day up 1.5% to $1,742 per patient day in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Occupancy in our critical illness recovery hospital segment was 67% in the fourth quarter compared to 66% in the same quarter last year. \u2047 For the year, net revenue in our critical illness recovery hospital segment increased 4.7% to $1.84 billion. \u2047 Again, we experienced an increase in both volume and rate compared to last year. \u2047 Patient days were up 2.6% and net revenue per patient day was up 2.2% to $1,753 per patient day for the year. \u2047 Overall, occupancy in our critical illness recovery hospitals was 68%

in our outpatient rehab segment for the fourth quarter increased 7.7% to $272 million compared to $252 million in the same quarter last year. \u2047 Patient visits increased 7.2% to over $2.25 million

million visits compared to 11.4 million visits last year. \u2047 Revenue per visit was $122 this year compared to $124 per visit last year. \u2047 The decline in revenue per visit for both the fourth
