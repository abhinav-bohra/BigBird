{"article": ["I'm joined today by Roy Harvey, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and William Oplinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 With that, here's Roy. \u2047 We had another strong quarter, bolstered by aluminum prices that are higher than we've seen in more than a decade. \u2047 Before we get underway, however, in particularly at a time where we are experiencing a rapidly changing market dynamic, I would like to reinforce once again that our values, which we established when we launched as an independent company in 2016 continue to guide us. \u2047 It's not just about the results, but also how we achieve them. \u2047 Our values continue to be foundational for our company and our embedded in all of our decisions. \u2047 Now, as Alcoa Corporation approaches its five-year anniversary, we've been reflecting on the achievements Alcoans across the globe that helped us to accomplish. \u2047 It is clear that our strategic priorities are creating value. \u2047 Today, Alcoa is much stronger than when we launched. \u2047 We've significantly improved our processes, we've strengthened our balance sheet, we've reshaped our portfolio, we responded to societies need for responsible production launching the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of low-carbon products, and we've also certified many of our assets to the stringent standards of the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative. \u2047 In addition, our strategic priorities have helped us to do exactly what we said we wanted to do, strengthen our company to prepare for an even brighter future. \u2047 And today, we've reached an important milestone. \u2047 Additionally, we've authorized a new share repurchase program that will complement our existing program that was authorized in 2018. \u2047 These decisions concerning capital returns align with our existing capital allocation framework and reflect two important points. \u2047 First, we have confidence in the strength of our company and our ability to generate cash to sustain these programs through the commodity cycle. \u2047 Today, both our balance sheet and operating portfolio are in a much stronger position, with no substantial debt maturities until 2027. \u2047 Second, we believe the markets we participate in will be stronger, that this cycle will last longer and then Alcoa is well positioned to deliver in a low-carbon ESG focused world. \u2047 But our work is never complete. \u2047 These achievements simply serve as a strong foundation. \u2047 Despite the positive financial news, I am disappointed that we had a serious injury in the quarter. \u2047 An electrical contractor in Brazil sustained a life-threatening electrical shock. \u2047 Our focus must always be on the safety of everyone who visits or works at our facilities. \u2047 As our comments progress today, I'd like to highlight some recent initiatives that align with our strategic priorities and that use this strong foundation as a starting point. \u2047 The Alumar restart that will be powered by renewable energy, the joint development project for high purity alumina and our net-zero ambition. \u2047 The green evolution is happening fast and as evidenced by these projects, we are positioning ourselves for the future. \u2047 Also, we'll talk more today about the strength in aluminum pricing and an improved pricing trend in Alumina. \u2047 But first, let's review the financials with our CFO, Bill Oplinger. \u2047 This quarter was even better than the previous one. \u2047 Revenues at $3.1 billion were up $276 million or 10% sequentially. \u2047 Revenues were up $744 million or 31% from the same period last year on higher aluminum and alumina prices. \u2047 Realized aluminum prices were up 13% sequentially and 64% year-over-year. \u2047 Third quarter earnings per share was $1.76 per share, $0.13 per share higher than the prior quarter and $2.02 per share higher than the year ago quarter. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter increased 38% sequentially, to a record $2.05 per share. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items also increased, up 18% sequentially to $728 million, much higher than last year's $284 million. \u2047 These charts, which debuted last quarter show that the Aluminum segment with modest income taxes and virtually no minority interest continues to outperform and drive record net income. \u2047 In the first nine months of 2021, the Aluminum segment has had its best year so far, with nearly $1.4 billion or 73% of Alcoa's total adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items of $1.9 billion. \u2047 That segment EBITDA generated record adjusted net income. \u2047 Before this year our best full year adjusted net income was in 2018 at $698 million. \u2047 In 2021, our adjusted net income for the first nine months is already $822 million or $124 million higher. \u2047 Now with Aluminum prices remaining at post global financial crisis highs and Alumina prices recovering nicely, earnings should be even better in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Now let's review adjusted EBITDA in more detail. \u2047 The $110 million increase in adjusted EBITDA excluding special items was driven by higher metal prices as well as favorable currencies, slightly higher Alumina prices and better product pricing in Alumina and Aluminum. \u2047 However, as you know, a Bauxite unloader at Alumar sustained structural damage in mid-July and we ramped down refinery production by roughly one-third with corresponding impacts to Bauxite production assurity[Phonetic]. \u2047 This outage had a $27 million impact in the quarter, mostly affecting shipment volume and production costs. \u2047 In addition, we experienced a few other impacts in the quarter, higher raw material costs, mostly caustic in the Alumina segment and carbon products in smelting, higher energy costs in Europe and to a lesser extent in Brazil were unfavorable by $71 million. \u2047 Spain costs increased by $53 million, while we also experienced higher costs in Norway and Brazil. \u2047 These increases were favorably offset by strong earnings in the Brazil hydros, the highest earnings in a decade for a net unfavorable energy impact of $17 million. \u2047 Lastly in the Aluminum segment, railcar delays in Canada and seasonal shipping patterns in Europe negatively impacted the results in the quarter. \u2047 The other column primarily reflects the non-recurrence of the Portland smelter government support, which ended in the second quarter after we repowered the facility through July 2026, and increased accruals for residue storage area improvements in Brazil. \u2047 Now let's look at impacts in our cash flows. \u2047 The cash flows continue to highlight major corporate actions as well as the benefits from very strong adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 To illustrate the strong cash generation in the last quarter, we have bridged from the second quarter ending cash balance to the third quarter cash balance. \u2047 Cash declined $200 million to $1.45 billion, our largest single outlay was $518 million in September when we redeemed the 2026 bonds, followed by working capital use of $206 million, $83 million of capital expenditures and a modest $19 million of pension and OPEB funding which is mostly OPEB. \u2047 EBITDA and other factors provided net inflows of $626 million. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, you can see the benefit of the strong nine months of EBITDA and the additional major sources of cash inflows, including non-core asset sales and the $500 million bond issue. \u2047 Those cash flows and EBITDAs also impact key financial metrics. \u2047 Return on equity increased to 30.2% for the first nine months of 2021, nine month 2021 free cash flow less non-controlling interest distributions was negative $51 million due to the second quarter's $500 million pension funding, but was positive $320 million in the third quarter due to the strong EBITDA, partially offset by a three-day increase in days working capital. \u2047 Most importantly, our key leverage metric proportional adjusted net debt is now below our $2 billion to $2.5 billion target range at $1.7 billion. \u2047 Working capital has increased in line with expectations, as metal prices continue to rise and now are being joined by Alumina price increases. \u2047 Moving to our outlook for the remainder of the year. \u2047 The full year 2021 outlook is expected to see modest changes. \u2047 For Bauxite shipments, the expected ranges are decreasing 1 million tons to 49 million tons to 50 million tons due to the Alumar unloader outage in the third quarter. \u2047 We are expecting improvements on the income statement below the EBITDA line. \u2047 Depreciation, depletion and amortization is expected to improve $10 million to $665 million, while interest expense is also expected to improve $10 million due to our redemption of the 2026 notes. \u2047 In the cash flow section, there are three expected changes. \u2047 Return seeking capital expenditures are expected to be $10 million lower. \u2047 Payment of prior year taxes has been adjusted $5 million to $30 million and environmental and ARO spending is expected to be $20 million better, down to $120 million for the year. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, overall with Alumar refinery production returning close to normal operating levels and if current Aluminum and Alumina index pricing levels persist, we expect another record-setting quarter. \u2047 However, at the San Ciprian refinery and smelter, the current high energy costs in the country and the strike if both persists through the quarter end are expected to be primary factors decreasing adjusted EBITDA approximately $100 million sequentially and increasing working capital sequentially $120 million. \u2047 Included in the San Ciprian impacts are in refining, we expect sequentially lower shipments of 86,000 metric ton and an unfavorable EBITDA impact of approximately $15 million. \u2047 In smelting, we expect sequentially lower shipments of 52,000 metric tons and an unfavorable EBITDA impact of approximately $85 million. \u2047 For the rest of the portfolio, adjusted EBITDA in the Bauxite segment is expected to improve $10 million sequentially, primarily due to recovery from the Alumar unloader outage in 3Q 2021. \u2047 Aside from Index pricing, currency and the San Ciprian impacts that I mentioned, the Alumina segment adjusted EBITDA is expected to be flat sequentially, higher shipments, cost improvements and the partial recovery from the Alumar unloader outage are expected to offset higher raw materials and energy costs. \u2047 In the Aluminum segment, again excluding the San Ciprian impact Index pricing and currency impacts and assuming today's spot alumina prices persist, while we expect substantial benefit in the Alumina segment, Alumina costs in the Aluminum segment are estimated to increase by $100 million. \u2047 Higher shipments are expected to offset increased raw materials and production costs, energy related impacts are expected to be comprised of two factors. \u2047 $30 million as Brazil hydro sales seasonally decline and higher smelter energy costs of $20 million primarily in Norway. \u2047 As Bill noted, the Aluminum segment has a significant role in our profitability. \u2047 The LME Aluminum price was the highest that has been in 13 years and has doubled relative to the low point in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 In addition, regional premiums are being influenced by higher transportation costs into deficit markets such as North America and Europe. \u2047 The continued economic recovery and the tightness of supply have continued to support this LME rally and high regional premiums. \u2047 We continue to see positive GDP in industrial production across the world's leading economies, which supports Aluminum demand across all major end-use sectors. \u2047 This year, we expect annual global demand for primary Aluminum to increase approximately 10% relative to 2020 and to surpass the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. \u2047 Strong demand is also being supported by China's continued status as a net importer of primary Aluminum. \u2047 In 2021, China has curtailed more than 2 million tons of annualized capacity due to power shortages and its enforcement of policies related to energy and the environment. \u2047 These curtailments represent one of the largest supply cuts the Aluminum industry has ever experienced, particularly given that they are occurring during a year in which we have seen strong demand growth. \u2047 These supply dynamics are not only occurring in China. \u2047 There have been recent reports in Europe regarding energy shortages and high power costs that may lead to smelting cuts there as well. \u2047 For Alcoa's commercial impacts, we are also seeing significant year-over-year growth for our value-add Aluminum products. \u2047 In the third quarter, the premiums we earn for value-add products were up relative to the second quarter. \u2047 Strong demand supported high spot premiums for open volumes. \u2047 Much of our volume for value-add products is sold in annual contracts. \u2047 So, only a portion benefits from high spot pricing. \u2047 However, current market dynamics provide a positive environment for 2022 contract negotiations. \u2047 Next, I'd like to comment on what we're seeing in the Aluminum market, which is also on the rise. \u2047 As we've noted previously, we are the world's largest third-party producer of Alumina and market fundamentals there have also become more favorable over this last month. \u2047 In the first two months of the quarter, ex-China Alumina prices remained more muted than in Aluminum, high freight costs made shipments to China unattractive and the market outside China had sufficient supply. \u2047 However, in the last month or so, we have seen a substantial rally in ex-China Alumina pricing. \u2047 Some unplanned production disruptions outside of China reduced the amount of Alumina available for spot purchases. \u2047 At the same time, some refineries in China have restricted production to be the same dynamics I discussed earlier in regards to the smelting cuts. \u2047 Power shortages and policies related to the environment in energy. \u2047 These dynamics have driven current global supply tightness in Alumina. \u2047 While China remains short in Alumina as a net importer, it is now competing with smelters outside of China for available Alumina. \u2047 As a result, prices for Alumina outside of China are at the highest levels they've been since 2018. \u2047 Now, let's move to a slide that recap some of the items that Alcoa has been doing to support our business for the future. \u2047 Our strategic actions over the past two years and our ongoing activities are positioning Alcoa for the future. \u2047 Two years ago, we announced three key strategic programs. \u2047 The new operating model, non-core asset sales amd the portfolio review. \u2047 We've already met the goals on two of these. \u2047 First, we fully implemented the new operating model and captured the annual savings. \u2047 Second, we also met the top end of our target for non-core asset sales. \u2047 The portfolio review, meanwhile, has three years remaining and was designed to improve both the cost structure and sustainability position of our global production assets, focusing primarily on smelting and refining. \u2047 It considers options for significant improvement, curtailment, closure or divest"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 adj earnings per share of
