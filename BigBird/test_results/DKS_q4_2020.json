{"article": ["A playback of today's call will be archived in our Investor Relations website located at investors. \u2047 dicks.com for approximately 12 months. \u2047 And finally, a couple of admin items. \u2047 First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices. \u2047 Our consolidated same-store sales calculation include stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 Accordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers. \u2047 We've never had quite a year like 2020. \u2047 We were challenged in numerous ways, as were so many others, but as an organization, we not only survived, we thrived. \u2047 The strength of our diverse category portfolio, technology capabilities and advanced omni-channel execution helped us capitalize on the favorable shifts in consumer demand across golf, outdoor activities, home fitness and active lifestyle. \u2047 For the full year, we delivered record sales and earnings. \u2047 Our consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 9.9%, which was on top of our 3.7% comp increase from the prior year. \u2047 And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.12 represented a 66% increase over last year. \u2047 We developed innovative technology, including curbside pickup that set the pace for the retail industry and helped drive full year eCommerce sales of over $2.8 billion, an increase of 100%. \u2047 Most importantly, we cared for each other and our communities every step of the way. \u2047 As we reopened our stores, the health and safety of our teammates and athletes was our highest priority, and we established protocols and procedures to provide a safe shopping experience. \u2047 Our frontline hourly associates and distribution center teammates went above and beyond in 2020, and we showed our appreciation to our premium pay program. \u2047 In total, in 2020, we invested approximately $175 million across incremental teammate compensation and safety costs. \u2047 Additionally, last Friday, we partnered with Allegheny Health Network to host a COVID-19 vaccination clinic at our corporate headquarters. \u2047 As a result of this partnership, approximately 6,000 community members were vaccinated. \u2047 The largest single vaccination clinic in State of Pennsylvania to date. \u2047 We plan to host a number of these vaccination clinics in the future also. \u2047 We also recognize that youth sports programs have been severely hampered by the pandemic and low-income communities of color have been most impacted. \u2047 To help get these kids back on the field, we donated $30 million this year to our Sports Matter Foundation to help serve these impacted communities. \u2047 While the pandemic informed much of our ESG activity in 2020, we also increased our focus on caring for the planet. \u2047 Among other actions, this past year, we committed to become the sports retail sector lead of the Beyond the Bag Challenge, which aims to identify innovative solutions to replace today's single-use plastic retail bags in a way that is both sustainable and convenient for our customers. \u2047 We also joined the outdoor association's Climate Action Corp and committed to publishing climate-related goals in 2021. \u2047 Today, as Lauren and Lee talk about another strong quarter, I remain as committed and is excited about our business as I've ever been. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of how our teammates managed through this challenging year. \u2047 They came together to care for their communities, their families and each other. \u2047 At DICK's, it is our people who make us great, and I am so excited for our future and for what I know we will all accomplish together. \u2047 Now on to our results. \u2047 Our Q4 consolidated same-store sales increased 19.3%, which was on top of our 5.3% comp increase in the same period last year. \u2047 Our strong comps were supported by significant growth across each of our three primary categories of hardlines, apparel and footwear, as we continued to benefit from favorable shifts in consumer demand, as well as strong execution from our team. \u2047 From a channel standpoint, our brick-and-mortar stores comped positively for a second straight quarter, increasing mid-single digits and our eCommerce sales increased 57%, representing nearly one-third of our total business. \u2047 Within eCommerce, we continued to see the strongest growth across in-store pickup and curbside, which increased nearly 250% compared to BOPIS sales in the prior year. \u2047 These same-day services are fully enabled by our stores, which are the hub of our industry-leading omni-channel experience, both serving our in-store athletes and providing over 800 forward points of distribution for digital fulfillment. \u2047 In fact, during Q4, our stores enabled 90% of our total sales and fulfilled over 70% of our online sales, either through ship-from-store, in-store pickup, or curbside. \u2047 During Q4, we again remained very disciplined in our promotional strategy and cadence, and certain categories in the marketplace continued to be supply constrained. \u2047 As a result, we expanded our merchandise margin rate by 372 basis points. \u2047 This merchandise margin expansion drove a significant improvement in gross margin, which on a non-GAAP basis increased 507 basis points. \u2047 In total, our fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.43 represented an 84% increase over last year. \u2047 It's clear that our strategies over the past several years are working and have helped us not only withstand the pandemic, but thrive, setting us up for long-term success. \u2047 As we enter 2021, our business has so much momentum, and we are pleased with the start to our year. \u2047 Our focus this year will center around enhancing our existing strategies to accelerate our core and enable long-term growth. \u2047 First within merchandising, our strategic partnerships with key brands have never been stronger, and we will continue to make big bets with important brand partners. \u2047 At the same time, we will continue to elevate our vertical brands. \u2047 As we've discussed on previous calls, our vertical brands have become a significant source of strength and growth. \u2047 During 2020, our vertical brands eclipsed $1.3 billion in sales, with comps outperforming the Company average by over 400 basis points. \u2047 Our DSG brand finished the year as our largest vertical brands and CALIA was again our second largest women's athletic apparel brands only behind Nike. \u2047 Furthermore, our vertical brands together represented the Company's largest brand in golf, fitness, outdoor equipment and team sports. \u2047 During 2021, we will invest in making our vertical brands even stronger, which will improve space in store and increase marketing, while expanding into additional product categories. \u2047 Later this month, we will augment our men's apparel collection by launching Burst[Phonetic], our new premium apparel brand that serves the modern athletic male. \u2047 Burst, which will only be available at DICK'S, will put us in a much stronger position to compete with similar offerings from premium apparel brands and specialty athletic apparel stores. \u2047 Also in 2021, we will build on our momentum from 2020 and drive growth in important categories, including golf, athletic apparel, footwear and team sports, as well as in fitness, we saw significant gains throughout the pandemic. \u2047 In 2020, our golf business across both DICK'S and Golf Galaxy was tremendous. \u2047 As the country's largest golf retailer, we are very well positioned to capitalize on increased participation and other favorable trends. \u2047 And in 2021, we will invest in TrackMan technology to enhance the fitting and lesson experience in our Golf Galaxy stores. \u2047 It will also enable online booking of lessons and club fittings, and we'll invest in talent to elevate our in-store service model. \u2047 Additionally in 2021, we plan to build on the strong results and momentum in our athletic apparel and footwear businesses. \u2047 Our athletic apparel assortment for 2021 is on trend, and we're excited to continue the energy in this category beyond the pandemic. \u2047 As part of this, we will convert over 100 additional stores to premium full-service footwear, taking this experience to over 60% of the DICK's chain. \u2047 We believe that these enhancements, along with strong consumer trends and improving allocations of the most in-demand styles, will drive continued positive results in our athletic apparel and footwear business. \u2047 Lastly, we expect our team sports business to provide a nice tailwind during 2021, as kids get back out on the field following a year in which many seasons were canceled. \u2047 Furthermore, we plan to reconceptualize our soccer business, an initiative we delayed last year because of COVID. \u2047 We will follow the same playbook we used to attack the baseball category in 2019, centered around more premium product, enhanced store experiences, and exceptional service. \u2047 Beyond merchandising, in 2021, we will focus on several key areas to enable the profitable growth of our business, including our omni-channel experience, data science and customer relationships. \u2047 Within our omni-channel experience, we will continue to lean on our stores as well as our eCommerce business to serve our customers whom we call athletes whenever, wherever and however they want. \u2047 As Ed mentioned earlier, in 2020, our eCommerce sales increased 100%, partially driven by our curbside service that we launched in March and continuously improved throughout the year. \u2047 Curbside pickup, along with fewer promotions and leverage of fixed costs, drove significant improvements in the profitability of our online channel in 2020. \u2047 In 2021, we expect curbside to remain a meaningful piece our omni-channel offering as our athletes turn to the service for speed and convenience. \u2047 In addition, the curbside will continue to improve our online shopping experience. \u2047 This includes leading with mobile, which for 2020 represented over 50% of our online sales. \u2047 This also includes shortening the path to purchase and reducing delivery times, as well as becoming a more consistent destination for our athletes' needs by offering a more integrated loyalty experience. \u2047 Beyond online shopping, through our game changer technology, we will enhance our scorekeeping and live streaming offering for youth sports with video on demand, all delivered through a premium subscription service. \u2047 We will also continue building relationships with both new and existing athletes in our stores and online. \u2047 In fact, the key to our omni-channel offering is our ScoreCard program, which in 2020 drove over 70% of total sales. \u2047 In 2021, we will continue to use data science to leverage our extensive athlete database to drive more personalized one-to-one marketing to increase loyalty among the 8.5 million new athletes that we acquired in 2020, including more than 2.5 million new athletes added during Q4. \u2047 Lastly, we are very excited to be opening our first experiential prototype store next week in Rochester, New York. \u2047 This new DICK's store called DICK's House of Sport will focus on service and community and allow us to innovate and deliver elevated experiences to our athletes, including an outdoor field to host sports events and from a product trial, a rock climbing wall and health and wellness basis for in-store programing. \u2047 It will serve as the test and learn center, and will roll the most successful elements into our core DICK'S stores. \u2047 As I look at our business, we are really in a great position. \u2047 Our brick-and-mortar stores and our technology platforms are working seamlessly together to deliver an industry-leading omni-channel experience. \u2047 We have world-class vertical brands and our vendor relationships with key partners have never been stronger. \u2047 We've become more athlete-centric focusing on friendly, knowledgeable and available service. \u2047 Importantly, we have a respected and loved brands, and are aligned behind our common purpose to create confidence and excitement by personally equipping all athletes to achieve their dreams. \u2047 In closing, we're extremely pleased with our Q4 and 2020 results and look forward to building on this success in 2021. \u2047 Let's begin with a brief review of our full-year 2020 results. \u2047 Consolidated sales increased 9.5% to $9.58 billion, even though stores were closed to foot traffic during the spring, representing 16% of our store days closed on average for the year. \u2047 Consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 9.9%. \u2047 And within this, we delivered a 100% increase in eCommerce sales. \u2047 And as a percent of total sales, our online business increased to 30% compared to 16% last year. \u2047 Gross profit for the full year was $3.05 billion, or 31.83% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, improved 249 basis points from last year. \u2047 This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 204 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy cost of 114 basis points, partially offset by shipping expenses resulting from meaningfully higher eCommerce sales growth. \u2047 Gross profit also included approximately $23 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs. \u2047 SG&A expenses were $2.3 billion, or 23.98% of net sales on a non-GAAP basis, and leveraged 25 basis points from last year, primarily driven by the significant sales increase. \u2047 SG&A dollars increased $178 million compared to last year's non-GAAP results, driven by $152 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs, as well as a $30 million donation we made to the DICK's Foundation to help jump-start youth sports program struggling to come back from the pandemic. \u2047 Apart from these items, increases in store payroll and operating expenses incurred to support the increase in sales were offset by expense reductions, including advertising during our temporary store closures. \u2047 Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $733.3 million, or 7.65% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $292.8 million, or 262 basis points from the same period last year. \u2047 In total, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.12, compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.69 last year, a 66% year-over-year increase. \u2047 Now moving to our Q4 results. \u2047 Consolidated net sales increased 19.8% to approximately $3.13 billion. \u2047 Consolidated same-store sales increased 19.3%, driven by a 20.3% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 1% decrease in transactions. \u2047 Our eCommerce sales increased 57%. \u2047 And as a percent of total net sales, our online business increased to 32% compared to 25% last year. \u2047 And lastly, we delivered significant growth across each of our three primary categories, hardlines, apparel and footwear. \u2047 Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $1.05 billion, or 33.67%
