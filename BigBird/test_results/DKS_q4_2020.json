{"article": ["This is Kasey Jenkins, Vice President of McCormick Investor Relations. \u2047 We will begin with remarks from Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO; and Mike Smith, Executive Vice President and CFO, and we'll close with a question and answer session. \u2047 These include information in constant currency as well as adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted income from unconsolidated operation and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA and a gain realized on sale of our unconsolidated operation. \u2047 In our comments, certain percentages are rounded. \u2047 Actual results could differ materially from those projected. \u2047 I will now turn the discussion over to Lawrence. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, we remained steadfast in our focus on our growth performance and people strategies, while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and positioning McCormick to emerge stronger from the crisis. \u2047 We continue to execute from a position of strength with the combination of our business model, the strategic investments we have made and capabilities we've built as an organization. \u2047 Our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, the acceleration of consumer trends that our strategies capitalize on and the effective execution of those strategies as well as our recent acquisitions of two fantastic businesses, and importantly, the engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth despite challenging comparisons as we lap very strong growth last year. \u2047 Our second quarter results were strong on top of our exceptional second quarter performance last year and also reflect our robust growth momentum on a two year basis, as seen on Slide 4. \u2047 We delivered significant double-digit two year growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share and expanded adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating margins. \u2047 Even considering increased COVID-19 and inflation costs as well as planned brand marketing investments, we are driving growth through executing on our long-term strategy, actively responding to changing consumer behavior and capitalizing on new opportunities. \u2047 We are emerging stronger. \u2047 As we enter the second half of the year, we continue to be confident in the effectiveness of our strategies, our growth trajectory and that we are well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated growth in 2021 with an even stronger outlook. \u2047 As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels. \u2047 The breadth and reach of our portfolio across segments, geographies, channels, customers and product offerings, creates a balanced and diversified portfolio to drive consistency in our performance in a volatile environment, as evidenced again by our second quarter results. \u2047 During last year's second quarter, the onset of the pandemic drove a surge in consumers' cooking and eating more at-home, at-home consumption, resulting in a substantial increase in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food customer -- food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment. \u2047 Last year, we also experienced a sharp decline in demand from our restaurant and other foodservice customers for the away-from-home products in our portfolio. \u2047 Our second quarter results reflect the lapping of these year ago comparisons as well as the sustained shift to consumer at-home consumption higher than pre-pandemic levels and the robust recovery from away -from -home customers. \u2047 Our second quarter results also included strong contributions from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions, which further extended the breadth and reach of our portfolio with new product offerings, channels and customers. \u2047 Taken together, these impacts continue to demonstrate the strength and diversity of our offering, and we are confident in our balanced portfolio that will continue to differentiate McCormick and sustainably position us for growth. \u2047 Now let me cover the highlights of our second quarter results. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6. \u2047 Total second quarter sales grew 11% from the year ago period and constant currency sales grew 8% attributable to substantial growth in our Flavor Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in our Consumer segment, both impacted by the factors I've mentioned a few moments ago. \u2047 The considerable shift in sales between segments resulted in an adjusted operating income decline of 1% or 4% in constant currency. \u2047 At the bottom line, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 in the year ago period, driven lower primarily by a higher tax rate. \u2047 As we stated in our March earnings call, we expect growth to vary by quarter in 2021 given 2020's level of demand volatility and the pace of COVID-19 recovery. \u2047 Importantly though, we started the first half of the year with outstanding performance. \u2047 Year-to-date, we've grown sales and adjusted operating income 16% and 14% year-over-year respectively, both of which include 3% favorable impact from currency, and we've grown adjusted earnings per share 10%. \u2047 While Mike will provide more details in a few moments, I'd like to comment on our outlook. \u2047 With our first half results and our robust operating momentum, we are increasing our 2021 outlook for sale, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. \u2047 We are operating in the dynamic cost environment and we're certainly not unique in experiencing cost pressures. \u2047 We're seeing broad-based inflation across our various commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. \u2047 To offset rising costs, we are raising prices where appropriate, but usually there are the lag times associated with pricing, particularly with how quickly costs are escalating. \u2047 Therefore, most of our actions won't go into effect until late 2021. \u2047 As pricing discussions are ongoing, we can't provide further specifics. \u2047 We have a demonstrated history of managing through inflationary period with the combination of pricing and cost savings. \u2047 Now let's turn to our second quarter segment business performance, which will include comparisons to 2019 pre-pandemic levels as we believe these to be more meaningful than the comparisons to 2020 given the dramatic shift in consumer consumption between at-home and away-from-home experienced in the year ago period. \u2047 Starting on Slide 7, with our Consumer segment comparing to the highly elevated demand levels in the second quarter of last year, sales declined by 2% or in constant currency, 5%. \u2047 Our Consumer segment organic sales momentum on a two year basis was up double-digits, highlighting how sustained shift in consumer consumption continues to drive increased demand for our products, and importantly, outpaces pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Our Americas constant currency sales declined 7% in the second quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth. \u2047 Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, declined 26%, following a 55% consumption increase in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 The difference between year-over-year shipment and consumption changes is attributable to two factors. \u2047 First, we under-shipped consumption in the second quarter of last year. \u2047 Second, we continue to replenish retailer and consumer pantry inventories that were completed throughout last year, demand has remained high, and we continue to realize the benefit of our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion. \u2047 Throughout our first half of the year, we restored products which had been suspended at the end of last year and continue to see service levels improve, and we are refilling the inventory pipeline. \u2047 As we have said previously, inventory replenishment will progress throughout the year. \u2047 Through working with our customers on improving shelf conditions, we estimate approximately 90% of suspended products are now back on shelf. \u2047 We know the categories most impacted by supply constraints, spices and seasonings and dry recipe mix, there is a high correlation between our share performance and the shelf conditions resulting from product suspension or allocation. \u2047 Products that had strong supply and remained on shelf performed well. \u2047 And as suspended products are restocked on shelf, we are seeing improved performance. \u2047 This improvement is somewhat masked due to the lapping of significant overall share gains in the second quarter of last year. \u2047 Importantly, we continue to anticipate regaining share as conditions continue to improve. \u2047 Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our IRI consumption data, combined with unmeasured channels, indicates consumption of the portfolio grew 18% versus the second quarter of 2019 led by significant growth in spices and seasonings and hot sauces, and also includes triple-digit pure-play growth in e-commerce with McCormick-branded consumption outpacing all major categories. \u2047 This is the third consecutive quarter our U.S. branded portfolio consumption grew double-digits in the mid -to-high-teens versus the two year ago period, which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our categories. \u2047 Our key categories continue to outpace the center of store growth rates, favorably impacting not only the McCormick brand, but smaller brands as well. \u2047 Household penetration and repeat buyer rates have also growth versus 2019. \u2047 And when our consumers shop, they are buying more of our products than they were pre-pandemic. \u2047 And finally, for the Americas, our initiative to reinvent the in-store experiences for spices and seasonings consumers with new merchandising elements to improve navigation and drive inspiration is yielding great early results. \u2047 Where implemented, the category and McCormick-branded growth is outpacing the rest of market as we plan to implement this in thousands of additional stores in the third quarter. \u2047 Now turning to EMEA, which has continued its outstanding momentum. \u2047 We had strong market share performance in the second quarter versus last year, maintaining or gaining share in our core brands and markets following the strong gains in the second quarter last year. \u2047 Notably, both Schwartz and Ducros spices and seasonings as well as Frank's RedHot grew consumption during the second quarter against a strong comparison to double-digit growth last year. \u2047 And not only are we retaining new households we gained last year, but we are also continuing to increase household penetration for the fifth consecutive quarter. \u2047 Our investments in brand marketing in the EMEA, which significantly increased in the second quarter compared to last year, are proven to be effective as evidenced by the metrics I just discussed as well as are achieving above benchmark rates for reach, engagement and click there for instance in our digital marketing. \u2047 Additionally, the creativity of our Vahine Half-py Birthday Campaign received national media attention in France as well as the prestigious award for its excellence in advertising the design. \u2047 On a two year basis, compared to the second quarter of 2019, we drove double-digit consumption growth and market share gains in our core categories and markets, including total EMEA region spices and seasonings, Vahine homemade desserts, France, and both Schwartz recipe mixes and Frank's RedHot in the U.K. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our EMEA supply chain has been very well positioned to meet the elevated demand and has contributed to our ability to grow share across the region. \u2047 In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter sales growth was strong. \u2047 During this time last year, China's Hubei province, where our Wuhan operations are located, remains in lockdown in part of the second quarter. \u2047 And our results reflect the recovery from that as well as the recovery of branded foodservice sales in China. \u2047 China's foodservice has almost fully returned to pre-pandemic levels with restaurant home delivery increasing at popularity. \u2047 Our consumer product demand declined due to lapping significant growth last year. \u2047 In Australia, we continue to see elevated consumption and share gains versus the second quarter of 2019 with Frank's RedHot and Stubb's consumption growing triple-digits and gaining share. \u2047 The Gourmet Garden, McCormick and Keen's spice and seasonings outpacing the categories with double-digit consumption growth. \u2047 Across all our regions, our new products continue to be integral to our growth, and we're gaining significant momentum with our recent launches. \u2047 For instance, our Grill Mates all-purpose seasoning and our Frank's frozen appetizers are driving growth in the Americas as consumers have shifted their thinking about convenience from no cooking to cooking easily. \u2047 And in EMEA, the rollout of our first choice glass bottle into the Eastern European market is going very well, increasing our relevance with consumers and driving share gains, as they perceive the glass bottle as a premium to sachet. \u2047 Moving forward, while we know we will be lapping challenging year-over-year consumption comparisons in the second half of the year, we are confident that we continue to capture the momentum in our Consumer segment. \u2047 We have more consumers than pre-pandemic. \u2047 They have come into our brands, are having a good experience and are buying our products again. \u2047 We are excited about our growth trajectory and expect continued and long-lasting growth from the sustained shift to consumers cooking more at home, fueled by our brand marketing, new product and category management initiatives as well as growth from our Cholula acquisition. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8. \u2047 Our Flavor Solutions second quarter results include not only recovering from the significant curtailment of away-from-home dining during last year's second quarter, but also the growth momentum we are gaining with our restaurant and other foodservice customers as well as the continued strong momentum with our packaged food and beverage customers. \u2047 In the second quarter, our sales rose 39% or 34% at constant currency with double-digit growth in all three regions. \u2047 And on a two year basis, our sales also increased double -digits in all three regions. \u2047 In the Americas, our FONA and Cholula acquisitions made a strong contribution to our significant growth in the second quarter, and we are executing on our strategy to shift our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products. \u2047 We continue to see strong growth in our consumer packaged food customers, while executing on our portfolio migration through new products and base business strength. \u2047 Compared to last year's second quarter, snack seasonings grew double-digits with strong growth in core iconic products as well as new products, and the innovation pipeline continues to be robust. \u2047 Consumers' rising global demand for hot spicy flavors is driving growth for our customer snacks and for our seasonings that flavor them. \u2047 And with the flavor hard seltzer trend accelerating, we are winning new business and growing our flavor sales for beverages considerably, up triple-digits in the second quarter. \u2047 Demand from our Americas away-from-home customer base or branded foodservice and restaurant customers increased significantly due to the recovery I mentioned a few moments ago. \u2047 Our away-from-home rebound in this region is at a slower pace as our customer base is more skewed to branded foodservice. \u2047 We anticipate our demand from this channel will strengthen as the year progresses and more dining options reopen. \u2047 In EMEA, as we cycle the significant decline in last year's second quarter from regionwide shutdowns, our growth was substantial. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.69.  \u2047  q2 sales rose 11 percent.  \u2047  sees fy sales up 11
