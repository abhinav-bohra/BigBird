{"article": ["We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments in the second quarter. \u2047 Their collective efforts delivered the company's strongest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.6 billion, surpassing last quarter's record by 43%. \u2047 Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is almost $2 billion higher than the first half of 2020. \u2047 Wood Products delivered another record quarter at $1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA, surpassing last quarter's record by 56%. \u2047 Turning now to our second quarter business results. \u2047 I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages five through eight of our earnings slides. \u2047 Timberlands earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter. \u2047 In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the second quarter. \u2047 Western domestic markets remained favorable despite the decline in lumber prices late in the quarter and a healthy supply of logs to the market. \u2047 Demand remains strong as mills took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories in response to an early fire season resulting from persistent dry conditions in a period of extremely high temperatures. \u2047 This steady demand pull drove our sales volumes modestly higher during the second quarter. \u2047 Salvage operations from last year's fires in Oregon are continuing to supply an abundance of smaller diameter logs to the market. \u2047 Consequently, prices for smaller diameter logs in Oregon have experienced some downward pressure. \u2047 As a result of this dynamic, our domestic sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. \u2047 To date, we've harvested nearly 2/3 of our planned salvage volume in Oregon. \u2047 Salvage productivity has slowed somewhat as warm summer weather arrived early and we began to transition salvage harvest operations into higher elevation tracks, which generally have lower productivity and higher operating costs. \u2047 Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher during the quarter as we do a significant amount of this work during the warmer summer months. \u2047 Turning to our export markets. \u2047 In Japan and China, demand for our logs remained strong, and our sales realizations increased significantly. \u2047 Global logistics constraints, particularly with respect to shipping container availability and strong North American lumber prices continued to impact the availability of imported lumber into Japan and China. \u2047 This has resulted in strong demand for locally produced lumber and increased demand for imported logs. \u2047 Additionally, a ban on Australian logs continues to reduce the supply of imported logs to China. \u2047 Our China sales volumes increased in the quarter as we intentionally flexed volume from the domestic market to capitalize on strong demand signals and pricing from our Chinese customers. \u2047 Moving to the South. \u2047 Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 10% compared with the first quarter. \u2047 Southern sawlog markets improved due to record lumber and panel pricing for most of the quarter and supply limitations resulting from persistent wet weather. \u2047 Fiber markets also strengthened as mill inventories remain lean and wet conditions constrained supply. \u2047 As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the first quarter. \u2047 Fee and sales volumes were significantly higher in the quarter despite impacts from multiple heavy rain events across the Gulf South. \u2047 The wet weather in the quarter did, however, limit our ability to catch up on delayed harvest from the first quarter snow and ice events. \u2047 Log and haul costs increased slightly, and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. \u2047 Although Southern export represents a small component of our operations, we continue to see strengthening demand signals from China and India, resulting in increases in both sales volumes and realizations in the second quarter. \u2047 However, container availability and increased freight rates continue to be a notable headwind. \u2047 In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions, partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations. \u2047 Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages nine and 10. \u2047 Earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter due to timing of real estate sales and mix of properties sold, but were significantly higher than the year ago quarter. \u2047 Earnings increased by more than 230% compared with the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Demand for HBU properties has been very strong year-to-date and average price per acre remains elevated compared to historical levels. \u2047 We continue to capitalize on this market and have been increasing our prices in many regions. \u2047 This is resulting in a steady stream of high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber. \u2047 In Energy and Natural Resources, production of construction materials increased as demand remained strong during the quarter. \u2047 Wood Products, Pages 11 through 13. \u2047 Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by almost $0.5 billion compared with the prior quarter. \u2047 Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses all established new quarterly adjusted EBITDA records in the second quarter. \u2047 These exceptional results were delivered, notwithstanding ongoing challenges with transportation and resin availability in the quarter. \u2047 In the lumber market, average framing lumber composite pricing increased 29% compared with the first quarter. \u2047 Lumber demand was strong during the first half of the quarter, but began to soften as do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity weakened toward the latter part of May. \u2047 The drop-off in the do-it-yourself segment, largely a result of changing consumer spending habits coming out of COVID restrictions and to some extent, record high lumber prices resulted in lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers and treaters. \u2047 As a result, lumber prices peaked in late May and retreated at a rapid pace for the remainder of the quarter. \u2047 Although inventories at home centers and treaters increased, inventory levels at dealers and distributors serving the homebuilding and professional repair and remodel segments remained below normal at quarter end. \u2047 Buyer positioning remains cautious with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory positions and a dynamic pricing environment. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for lumber increased $291 million or 57% compared with the first quarter. \u2047 Our sales realizations increased by 25% and sales volumes increased moderately. \u2047 Log costs increased slightly in the second quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. \u2047 OSB markets experienced historic strength in the second quarter as demand continued to outpace supply. \u2047 Inventories remain lean throughout the channel and supply constraints persisted due to resin availability and transportation challenges. \u2047 As a result, pricing continued to accelerate to record levels before peaking at the end of the quarter. \u2047 Average OSB composite pricing increased 52% compared with the first quarter. \u2047 OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $172 million or 57% compared to the first quarter. \u2047 Our sales realizations improved by 48%. \u2047 Production and sales volumes decreased modestly and unit manufacturing costs increased, primarily due to a planned extended maintenance outage to complete a capital project at our Elk in OSB mill. \u2047 Fiber costs were slightly higher in the quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. \u2047 Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $11 million compared to the first quarter, a 26% improvement. \u2047 Sales realizations improved across all products, and we continue to benefit from the price increases announced over the last year for solid section and I-joists products. \u2047 This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board web stock, resin and veneer. \u2047 Sales and production volumes increased for solid section and I-joists products. \u2047 In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased $36 million compared to the first quarter, a 92% improvement as strong demand drove higher sales volumes for most products and the business captured improved margins. \u2047 I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. \u2047 We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date. \u2047 These are our highest first half operating cash flows on record. \u2047 Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD for year-to-date second quarter 2021 totaled nearly $1.9 billion, with approximately $1.2 billion related to second quarter operations, as highlighted on Page 16. \u2047 Year-to-date, we have returned $255 million to our shareholders through payment of our quarterly base dividend. \u2047 As a reminder, we target a total return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD; in the case of 2021, the majority will be returned to the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework. \u2047 Turning to the balance sheet. \u2047 We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. \u2047 During the second quarter, we repaid our $225 million variable rate term loan due in 2026 and incurred no early extinguishment charges. \u2047 We plan to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter and full year 2021 are presented on Pages 17 and 18. \u2047 In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than second quarter. \u2047 Turning to our Western Timberland operations. \u2047 Domestic mills ended the second quarter with ample inventory. \u2047 We anticipate slightly lower domestic log sales realizations in the third quarter, absent significant fire-related disruption. \u2047 This is primarily due to modestly lower pricing for smaller diameter sawlogs. \u2047 We expect large log pricing will remain favorable due to limited supply and strong export demand. \u2047 We anticipate seasonally higher forestry and road spending as those activities accelerate with favorable weather conditions. \u2047 Typical of the drier, warmer summer months, harvest activity will focus on higher elevation tracks where operations are less productive, resulting in slightly lower fee harvest volumes and higher per unit log and haul costs. \u2047 Moving to the export markets. \u2047 In Japan, log demand remains strong. \u2047 We expect our third quarter sales realizations and log sales volumes to be generally comparable to the second quarter. \u2047 In China, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes and slightly higher sales realization. \u2047 Although Chinese log demand generally moderates during the summer rainy season, we expect demand for U.S. logs will remain strong as imports from other countries remain constrained. \u2047 In the South, we anticipate significantly higher fee harvest volumes as well as higher per unit log and haul costs during the third quarter due to a seasonal increase in activity. \u2047 Although our sawlog and fiber log pricing should be comparable to the second quarter, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly lower due to a higher percentage mix of fiber logs. \u2047 We also expect seasonally higher forestry and road costs as most of this activity is completed during these dryer summer months. \u2047 In the North, sales realizations are expected to be lower due to mix, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher as we come out of the spring breakup season. \u2047 I'll wrap up the Timberlands outlook with a comment on the sale of our North Cascades Timberland, which was completed on July 7. \u2047 In the third quarter, we will record a cash inflow of $261 million and a gain of approximately $30 million related to this transaction. \u2047 The gain will be reported as a special item within the Timberlands segment. \u2047 Turning to our real estate, energy and natural resources segment. \u2047 We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter 2020, but earnings will be approximately $20 million higher than one year ago due to a lower average land basis on the mix of properties sold. \u2047 As Devin mentioned, we continue to capitalize on exceptionally strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. \u2047 In addition, we've seen strong year-to-date production of construction materials. \u2047 As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to $290 million. \u2047 We now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 30% to 35% for the year. \u2047 For our Wood Products segment, third quarter benchmark pricing for lumber has significantly reduced from record levels and benchmark pricing for oriented strand board has also recently declined. \u2047 As a result, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower in the third quarter. \u2047 For lumber, our quarter-to-date realizations are approximately $425 lower, and current realizations are approximately $535 lower than the second quarter average. \u2047 For OSB, our current realizations are still significantly higher than the second quarter average due to the length of our order files. \u2047 Our quarter-to-date OSB realizations are approximately $155 higher and current realizations are approximately $125 higher than the second quarter average. \u2047 As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. \u2047 And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. \u2047 For lumber, as prices have retreated, we expect higher sales volumes as inventories at home centers and treaters normalize and demand signals improve for do-it-yourself activity. \u2047 We are also anticipating improved unit manufacturing costs during the quarter. \u2047 We anticipate this will be partially offset by slightly higher costs for Canadian and Western logs. \u2047 For oriented strand board, we expect demand will remain favorable due to continued strength in new residential construction activity. \u2047 We expect improved operating rates following the second quarter outage to complete the capital project at our Elkin OSB mill previously mentioned. \u2047 With increased operating rates, we anticipate higher third quarter sales volumes and improved manufacturing costs. \u2047 These improvements are expected to be partially offset by higher fiber costs. \u2047 For Engineered Wood Products, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-joists products as we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases. \u2047 In May 2021, we announced another increase, which ranges from 15% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. \u2047 We anticipate significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board web stock, as the cost of web stock lags benchmark OSB pricing by approximately 1/4. \u2047 For our Distribution business, we're expecting the recent declines in commodity pricing will result in reduced margins and significantly lower adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 Business results are expected to remain strong compared to a historical perspective. \u2047 I'll wrap up with a couple of additional comments on our total company financial items. \u2047 Each year in the second quarter, we finalize prior year-end estimates for pension assets and liabilities. \u2047 As a result, we recorded a $138 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense. \u2047 Slide 18 includes our current full year outlook for pension and post-employment items. \u2047 It also shows the $40 million capital expenditure increase we announced back in June for some additional high-return projects across our"],
