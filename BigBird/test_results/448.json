{"article": ["We refer to certain of these risks in our SEC filings. \u2047 Participating in today's call with me will be Paul McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Riffee, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Karen Filter, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; Drew Hammond, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer; and Graham Montgomery, Vice President and Head of Research. \u2047 We delivered strong second quarter financial performance against the backdrop of the ongoing economic disruption, highlighting the resilience of our portfolio. \u2047 As the local economy gradually reopens, our primary focus continues to center around the health and safety of our residents, tenants, employees and their families. \u2047 Over the past several months, WashREIT created and implemented a comprehensive reentry plan to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 at our properties. \u2047 We connected with our office tenants through personalized outreach to understand their needs and discuss our approach to make sure that they are comfortable with the protocols that we have implemented. \u2047 We are fortunate to have not experienced material bad debt to date in alongside reentry planning, we've been diligently working with tenants who have been financially impacted by the economic shutdown to discuss and finalize deferral arrangements. \u2047 As of today, we are pleased to report that we have substantially completed that effort. \u2047 There is no doubt that these are trying times. \u2047 However, we have adjusted to the new demands of today's operating environment and have taken swift and deliberate action to protect and support our residents and tenants. \u2047 I could not be more proud of the dedication shown by the WashREIT team during this challenging period. \u2047 Furthermore, these times have highlighted the importance of social fairness, equity and justice. \u2047 And our company has responded with a refocused commitment to improving diversity, inclusion and belonging within our company and our community and creating long-lasting positive change. \u2047 As we enter the second half of the year, we are increasingly confident in the resilience of our region and likewise, our portfolio. \u2047 Our Washington metro focus provides economic stability compared to other major metropolitan areas. \u2047 This is true both historically and during the current downturn. \u2047 As the Washington metro area continues to experience fewer job losses since the pandemic hit than other large metro areas and the U.S. overall. \u2047 Washington Metro employment declined 9% during the second quarter compared to over 11% for the U.S. overall. \u2047 A recent analysis completed by Delta Associates determined that the Washington multifamily market is better positioned to weather a down cycle than nearly all of the nation's other large metropolitan areas. \u2047 This is due in large part to the presence of the federal government and the corresponding stability of the professional business services sector, which together comprised 46% of the D.C. metro economy compared to 25% for the 30 largest metro areas. \u2047 Furthermore, our professional business services sector is more heavily weighted toward the professional, scientific and technical subsector, which has fared very well during this crisis and generated year-over-year job growth of 1.6% in June. \u2047 This sector is expected to bounce back much quicker than other sectors and continues to be the primary private job creation source in the region over the long term, according to Delta Associates. \u2047 Unsurprisingly, the federal government sector has been the least negatively impacted by the pandemic thus far. \u2047 Many federal agencies actually received funding a funding boost, which could lead to additional hiring, especially at critical agencies such as the FDA, NIH and FDA. \u2047 Government contractors have seen $1.2 billion in contracts awarded year-to-date that are directly tied to the COVID-19 response, according to JLL. \u2047 Employment trends for the regional information sector reflect limited disruption and major tech industry investments, including Amazon's HQ2 campus construction and Virginia Tech yard campus. \u2047 The Washington metro area led the country in Q2 leasing activity, driven by 1.6 million square feet of positive net absorption in Northern Virginia. \u2047 Despite the stay-at-home orders, office leasing activity in Northern Virginia declined only 12% in the second quarter compared to the five-year trailing quarterly average, according to CBRE. \u2047 Over half of the leasing activity in Northern Virginia was driven by government contracting services. \u2047 Government contractor awards are up 4% year-over-year due to the government's response to COVID-19. \u2047 Check and government contracting for 60% of our office leasing volume in Northern Virginia last year. \u2047 And looking forward, we expect demand from these sectors to continue to grow. \u2047 Unsurprisingly, Washington D.C. office leasing activity has slowed more than it did in Northern Virginia due to lower momentum leading into this downturn. \u2047 However, the impact of local job losses for office using sectors in D.C. has been limited. \u2047 With no office using sector losing more than 5% of the total workforce during the second quarter, according to BLS data. \u2047 Additionally, the number of tours increased substantially in July. \u2047 We expect our D.C. office portfolio to act defensively against this backdrop. \u2047 Maryland, Virginia and D.C. each took a phased approach to reentry beginning at the end of May. \u2047 D.C. and Maryland are currently in Phase two with limited reopenings of shops and restaurants, and Virginia is in Phase 3, which has allowed all retail and public services to resume with social distancing measures in place. \u2047 With the implementation of Phase two reentry protocols, we are seeing increased activity across all of our asset classes. \u2047 Multifamily touring and application volumes have increased threefold from early April for both our same-store and non-same-store assets and same-store applications are trending above prior year levels. \u2047 Following the closure of our leasing office, we took advantage of our virtual touring capabilities and continued leasing in April and May. \u2047 And once social distancing requirements were eased locally, we began offering self-guided tours in June. \u2047 Just recently, we have opened our multifamily amenities in common areas and started offering in-person tours with additional safety precautions. \u2047 Lease-up of Trove continues to progress and is expected to reach stabilized occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 While the economic shutdown has impacted the original expected pace of leases, we averaged approximately 16 leases per month during the second quarter and expect to reach breakeven levels of occupancy by year-end, followed by steady quarterly NOI growth thereafter. \u2047 Our total lease rate growth for the quarter was a positive 40 basis points, which, combined with our sequential decline in ending occupancy of less than 80 basis points to our stabilized properties demonstrates the resilience of our value-oriented multifamily portfolio. \u2047 Lease rates for our non-same-store portfolio, which includes strong performance from our Class B suburban communities, grew over 2% during the quarter on a blended basis, comprised of 2.6% of renewal lease rate growth and 1% of new lease rate growth. \u2047 Our suburban garden-style apartments offer larger unit sizes, open-air hallways and less density compared to mid or high-rise buildings, allowing us to participate in the increasing demand for these qualities over the near-term in the wake of the pandemic. \u2047 Over the long term, the expansion of our multifamily portfolio to growing suburban markets in the D.C. metro suburbs positions us to capture an increasing share of regional household formation and job growth. \u2047 We began to experience an uptick in utilization at all of our office properties toward the end of the quarter, although, most notably at our Northern Virginia office assets, as Northern Virginia is now in Phase three of reopening. \u2047 In preparation for the repopulation of our properties, we prepared a detailed property reentry plan that emphasizes employee and tenant health and well-being as top priorities. \u2047 We have reached out to our tenants to discuss the plans and protocols that we have put in place. \u2047 The feedback regarding our collaborative approach has been very positive, and in many cases, we strengthened our relationships with our tenants. \u2047 We've upgraded our office buildings to ventilation filters, which is the standard for superior commercial office buildings, installed directional safety practice signage, contactless opening technology and proactive shield around front office desk in addition to a variety of other measures taken to facilitate safe reentry. \u2047 We have also established enhanced cleaning protocols that include more frequent cleaning and the use of electrostatic cleaning sheets and have developed elevator and common area safety protocols designed to mitigate the risk of virus transmission. \u2047 Our tenant experience app, NU, which began rolling out in January, has kept us connected with many of our tenants despite working remotely. \u2047 The Concierge program has continued to provide a wide range of on-demand services and partner with local vendors and farmers to provide grocery and other essential deliveries. \u2047 We could not have picked a more critical time to roll out this technology to assist our tenants both professionally and personally during this challenging time. \u2047 Our Space+ program has allowed us to meet changing tenant needs more efficiently with flexible lease terms. \u2047 Our spaces offer tenants quick move-ins all in pricing, flexibility for short and long-term planning as well as privacy and independence, not just for brand building, but now more importantly than ever for control over the health of the tenant's office. \u2047 All of our Space+ tenants have control over their own private space, which is becoming increasingly important in this COVID-19 environment. \u2047 In an environment where many tenants are moving slower on larger and longer requirements, flexibility is key, and Space+ is playing a crucial role in meeting tenant needs. \u2047 We entered 2020, expecting to see sequential quarterly growth, driven by renovation-led value creation and commercial lease commencements. \u2047 While the pandemic has disrupted the timing of that growth, our key growth drivers remain intact. \u2047 In multifamily, we have positioned our portfolio to retain the growth drivers but we may capture that value for our shareholders as normal activities and opportunities return. \u2047 We've allocated capital to Class B properties in submarkets with wider than average gaps between Class A and Class B rents and limited competitive supply, which sets us up for a quick recovery and preserve the value-add rent growth from renovations for the future. \u2047 Through our 2019 strategic allocation, we increased our renovation pipeline to over 3,000 units, which represents five years of growth at compelling return on costs. \u2047 While most of our portfolio does not directly compete with new supply, deliveries in Northern Virginia, where 80% of our multifamily portfolio is located, are expected to decrease by 24% over the next 12 months. \u2047 Furthermore, the pandemic will likely cause delays in projected construction starts in the second half of 2020, which will reduce the number of deliveries in 2022 and into 2023. \u2047 And overall, there is an acute housing shortage in the Washington metro region and our in-house research affirms our confidence that growth opportunities are still ahead of us. \u2047 We also have a tremendous opportunity for growth, having substantially made the capital outlay for Trove with Phase two delivering in a couple of months. \u2047 While the disruption certainly changed the initial pace of lease up, we expect to reach a breakeven occupancy level in the fourth quarter and thereafter achieve quarterly sequential NOI growth through stabilization in 2021 and into 2022. \u2047 We in the office portfolio, our embedded growth is comprised of future commencements for high-quality space and value-oriented pricing and move-in ready space with flexible lease terms. \u2047 We expect signed leases to continue to occupy, and we expect to benefit from higher occupancy in the fourth quarter and throughout 2021. \u2047 Many of our speculative leasing opportunities, for which we had excellent momentum before the pandemic hit, are located in our best assets, including Watergate 600, Arlington Tower and Silverline center as well as our Space+ program, which is positioned well to meet demand in these early, cautious transition months. \u2047 While physical touring did pause, it is now resuming, although decision-making remains slower than normal wire entry is being more pure by prospective tenants. \u2047 We believe those leasing opportunities are a matter of when, not if, they will commence. \u2047 I'll start off by discussing our cash collection performance before reviewing our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2020. \u2047 Our multifamily collections continue to be very strong, which is a testament to the resilience of our submarkets and industry mix and lower average rent-to-income ratio of 26%. \u2047 We collected over 99% of cash rents during the second quarter and over 99% of contractual rents. \u2047 And our rent collections through the first three weeks of July have been strong also. \u2047 While we are offering deferred payment programs to residents who've been financially impacted by the pandemic to date, deferrals have been relatively low, representing less than 0.4% of total monthly rental income on average. \u2047 Our monthly multifamily collection performance continues to track above national averages. \u2047 We collected 99% of cash rents in June compared to 96% per NMHC. \u2047 We attribute our outperformance in part to high exposure to industries that have outperformed during this crisis and lower relative exposure to underperforming industries. \u2047 The impact of COVID-19 on the Washington metro market has been contained primarily to three sectors, representing approximately 75% of Washington metro job losses. \u2047 While the impact has been more broadly spread across a wider range of sectors in the U.S. overall. \u2047 As those same three sectors represented less than 60% of total losses nationally through June. \u2047 Thus, the U.S. overall is experiencing job losses that are spread across more industries than our region. \u2047 The Washington metro market's relative strength reflects the stability in business revenue provided by technology and federal contracting. \u2047 We track the industries our residents are employed in, and our exposure is most heavily weighted to the most resilient economic sectors and likewise, less weighted to the industries that have been most impacted, which has resulted in very high collection rates and stable cash flows. \u2047 We collected 97% of cash rents during the second quarter and over 99% of contractual rents, which excludes rent that has been deferred. \u2047 As of July 22, our collections for July are in line with the same period in June. \u2047 Similar to our multifamily resident industry minutes, our office tenants are relatively weighted to the stronger economic sectors than the U.S. overall, which has helped us experience limited bad debt thus far. \u2047 We have agreed to defer $1.2 million of rent for office tenants, and we expect to collect over 85% of that deferred rent by year-end 2021 with the balance thereafter. \u2047 We believe our efforts to substantially derisk our portfolio by selling all single-tenant office assets and 75% of our prior retail exposure, including all of the power centers, and reallocating that capital to our multifamily portfolio is certainly proving its value in these economic times. \u2047 Retail now comprises just 6% of NOI and while retail tenants have struggled the most, we collected 72% of retail rents in the second quarter. \u2047 Excluding deferred rent, our collection rate was approximately 90% during the second quarter and 91% during the first three weeks of July. \u2047 Year-to-date, we've only"], "gold_summary": ["washington real estate investment trust q2 core ffo per share $0.39.  \u2047  q2 core ffo per share $0.39.  \u2047  qtrly same-store noi
