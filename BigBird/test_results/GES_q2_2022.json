{"article": ["including potential impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. \u2047 Comments will also reference certain non-GAAP or adjusted measures. \u2047 Before turning the call to Carlos, I would like to mention that we will be participating in the fireside chat at the Goldman Sachs Annual Global Retailing Conference on Friday, September 10 at 03:20 PM Eastern. \u2047 We hope to see you there. \u2047 We are very proud of our team and our accomplishments. \u2047 We just closed a great quarter and we plan to review what drove our performance in detail. \u2047 But most importantly, I want to share with you where we are today and how we see the future, both short and long-term. \u2047 Let me start with our results. \u2047 For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings from operations of $89 million. \u2047 This compares to adjusted operating earnings of $48 million for the LLY period exceeding our pre-pandemic performance by 85%. \u2047 This was well ahead of our expectations. \u2047 We reported revenues of $629 million, 58% over last year and 8% below the LLY period. \u2047 The entire decline to LLY was due to a timing shift of European wholesale shipments into Q3 and permanent store closures, which are accretive to operating profit. \u2047 This is in spite of being significantly less promotional during the period in all of our direct-to-consumer businesses. \u2047 For the quarter, we delivered that 14% adjusted operating margin. \u2047 We expanded our operating margin by over 700 basis points from 7% in the LLY period. \u2047 The star of this quarter was the North America Retail segment that reported an operating profit of $38 million versus $6 Million in the LLY period and almost 540% increase. \u2047 Our Wholesale and Licensing businesses also outperformed, and Europe and Asia delivered roughly flat operating performance to the LLY period. \u2047 Paul and I continue to be thrilled with our team's performance all over the world, adjusting and reacting seamlessly to the fluidity of the current environment. \u2047 We are happy to see demand recovering and stores reopened across the globe. \u2047 We still see the pandemic's impact on customer traffic and on the supply chain globally. \u2047 The labor market has also been impacted as companies are challenged to rehire workers leading to labor shortages and higher wages. \u2047 At Guess, we remain laser focused on what we can control. \u2047 As a global brand, we have adapted quickly to the changing levels of demand and restrictions across our markets. \u2047 We are sizing our inventory buys accordingly, adjusting prices to the perceived value of our products, strategically managing promotional activity and increasing labor rates to attract and retain top talent. \u2047 We continue to keep cost very tight by eliminating redundancies and increasing efficiencies. \u2047 We have been relentless in mitigating supply chain disruptions. \u2047 We are strategically partnering with our vendors to accelerate deliveries when feasible, changing countries of origin when appropriate to increase speed to market and investing in faster transportation modes when it makes sense. \u2047 Our strategy is working and our results reflect this. \u2047 I am proud to share with you that we published our latest sustainability report this summer, focused on our three pillars to operate with integrity, empower our people and protect the environment. \u2047 Some highlights include reaching gender pay parity, increasing our eco-smart Guess penetration to 20% and receiving approval in our ambitious science-based targets for greenhouse gas reductions. \u2047 We are confident in our actions here. \u2047 In fact, we successfully passed a reasonable assurance review by a big firm making Guess the first in fashion to subject our ESG data to such a high level operator. \u2047 We have increased our environmental quality score with the Independent shareholder services to a 1 out of 10, the highest rating possible, as a result of this work. \u2047 Let me now spend a few minutes talking about what's going on in the different regions and channels of our business. \u2047 In North America, traffic has improved sequentially each quarter, but remains well below historical levels and we continue to see higher conversion rates and higher average spend. \u2047 We are in the midst of back-to-school and we have solid demand for denim, activewear and knits. \u2047 In addition, we have seen sequential sales growth for our dresses category, which was positive to LLY for the first time since that pandemic began. \u2047 Both our Guess and Marciano brands are experiencing increases in sales of dressing, apparel and accessories as the customer is returning to social life. \u2047 We have also been successful with our handbags and wear-now products and our men's business has been particularly strong. \u2047 In Europe, we had a stronger start to the second quarter, which leveled off as the delta variant spread in many countries there. \u2047 Activewear continue to outperform in this region, both for women and men and we saw substantial pop in denim in Q2 as well as improved demand for dresses and outerwear. \u2047 We are encouraged by the progress that most countries in Europe have made with vaccination levels and we remain optimistic about the recovery of this region in the second half of the year. \u2047 In Asia, our customer traffic is the most challenged due to the virus and the trends remain relatively consistent in Q2 versus Q1. \u2047 The product categories that have performed better in this environment includes sweaters, denim and outerwear. \u2047 While we have made good progress in several areas of the operation, our challenges with topline performance remain. \u2047 We are reassessing our team and we are making leadership changes to reorganize the business today. \u2047 Our e-commerce business grew 11% in North America and Europe for the quarter versus last year. \u2047 Growth here was more moderate than prior quarters as we were a lot less promotional. \u2047 I'm pleased that we continue to significantly improve profitability in this channel. \u2047 In the back half of the year, we will be strategically investing more in marketing to support further growth in this business. \u2047 Our European wholesale business is performing well. \u2047 We are currently shipping our fall-winter season, which had orders up high-single digits. \u2047 As I mentioned, some of the products are delayed coming in. \u2047 So, they will ship in Q3 versus Q2. \u2047 The spring-summer season campaign is underway and we estimate that the order book will be higher than LLY with strong growth, particularly in our kids and footwear collections. \u2047 We're also very pleased with our Americas Wholesale business, which grew 19% in sales and 54% in operating profit versus LLY. \u2047 Denim had a great quarter and delivered strong performance at Macy's. \u2047 We're also having success in apparel for both men and women and accessories, particularly handbags. \u2047 Our global licensing business also recorded significant revenue growth of 18% versus the LLY period. \u2047 We have a big business here, primarily driven by handbags, eyewear, footwear and fragrances. \u2047 Regarding our strategic plan, I want to spend a few minutes updating you on our progress with our brand elevation and customer centricity initiatives. \u2047 I will start with our brand innovation strategy, which touches almost every aspect of our business. \u2047 Paul has been driving this very ambitious initiative with our product and creative teams. \u2047 His strong leadership and the work that the teams put into this to transform our model have been extraordinary and many major milestones have already been conquered. \u2047 We are focused on higher quality and sustainability across the board. \u2047 In addition, the new assortments have been priced based on the products perceived value. \u2047 Our visual merchandising on the images and photography in all the new marketing campaigns, catalogs and websites have been optimized to showcase our brand more effectively. \u2047 And our product development, marketing, visual merchandising and buying are integrated more closely than ever before. \u2047 We[Indecipherable] deep in these key styles to increase full price selling and maximize sales. \u2047 The last important step for elevating the brand is to improve the customer experience across the Guess ecosystem, including our stores, our websites, wholesale distribution and through our licensees. \u2047 We are mobilizing our field and business units to address this and we plan to upgrade our technology and tools to deliver superior service to our customers. \u2047 Some examples of these upgrades in store technology include enhanced WiFi networks, extended payment methods and mobile check outs. \u2047 These projects should be complete by the end of next year. \u2047 Regarding customer centricity, let me start with our customer base. \u2047 As you know, we resonate across three distinct customer groups: heritage, Millennials and Generation Z and we develop our product assortment to support the unique lifestyle needs of these customers. \u2047 With Gen Z, specifically, we have a separate strategy including differentiated product development, marketing and customer engagement. \u2047 This is our brand partnerships group led by Nicolai Marciano. \u2047 Product collaborations and events drive this business. \u2047 We had great success here pre-pandemic with key collaborations such as J Balvin. \u2047 But as you can imagine, the pandemic impacted our ability to execute this event-driven marketing campaign. \u2047 Now, we are able to restart these collaborations. \u2047 In fact, this past weekend, we had a successful event with Babylon and influential skate and streetwear label on our campus in LA where we hosted over 6,000 people over three days. \u2047 Regarding our digital business, we continue to make progress in optimizing our user online experience via the e-commerce platform that we implemented last year. \u2047 For example, in Europe, we are seeing improved conversion rates, especially from mobile, which represents over 80% of our traffic. \u2047 Our average web session duration increased over 20%, bounce rate decreased 10% and loading time versus our previous platform is 70% faster. \u2047 And during the quarter, we implemented some upgrades to the platform resulting in an increase in our add to basket sessions of over 30%. \u2047 We continue to work on implementing omnichannel capabilities in Europe as well as upgrade North America's current capabilities. \u2047 We plan to complete this project by mid-year next year. \u2047 The last pillar of our customer centricity strategy is related to customer data capture, segmentation and analytics. \u2047 We have built out a high-performance platform, but we're still operating on an extremely limited capacity to process and utilize our customer data. \u2047 We're now working on a platform, which includes powerful tools to fuel data collection, consumer insight analysis, personalized marketing and client telling. \u2047 We can use these tools to maximize sales from our existing customer base, as well as efficiently target new customers. \u2047 This implementation is underway and will be completed by next year. \u2047 This will be a game changer, allowing us to use our data to unlock a ton of value. \u2047 Now, let me talk about our outlook. \u2047 When I came back in early 2019, we identified several opportunities for value creation. \u2047 At that time, the most significant of these were in margin expansion. \u2047 We laid out a plan to increase operating margin by about 450 basis points to 10% in five years. \u2047 We used the pandemic as an accelerator to transform our business and not only are we expecting to reach our 10% target this year, but we are now increasing our operating margin target to 12% by fiscal year 2024, when we plan to deliver $2.8 billion in revenue. \u2047 I'm excited to share with you that this would yield a return on invested capital of over 30%. \u2047 I'm confident in this outlook and this is why. \u2047 We see clear opportunities for revenue growth from category expansions in areas like denim, Marciano, handbags, dresses and outerwear to new store development to digital sales growth. \u2047 Our margin expansion has come from concrete changes to our business model, including IMU improvements, store portfolio optimization and cost reductions. \u2047 And while we are currently operating in what might be on abnormally low promotional period industry wide, this company will never go back to the levels of promotional activity that it had pre-pandemic. \u2047 Our balance sheet is in a very good position, which allows us to fund our business needs, as well as return value to shareholders. \u2047 We announced today that our Board has authorized a share repurchase program of $200 million. \u2047 In closing, when I was invited to come back to Guess, I came back with high expectations, I knew that the company had an amazing global brand with tremendous potential and I felt that I could contribute to realize that potential. \u2047 But like Steve Jobs said I couldn't connect the dots looking forward and I had to trust my gut. \u2047 When I look back at what happened in the last two and a half years, I couldn't be more proud of what we have accomplished in the face of a pandemic of my partnership with Paul and of the transformation of our business into a company with an elevated global brand and a strong business model. \u2047 This is a company that is poised to gain significant market share, a company ready to deliver high return on invested capital fueled by high margins and a capital-light model. \u2047 A company with an amazing team ready to take the business to the next level of growth and profitability. \u2047 Today, I am thrilled to connect the dots looking backward and I couldn't be happier I trusted my gut to come back to my home. \u2047 With that, let me pass it to Katie to review our financials in more detail. \u2047 I want to start with something you can't see in the numbers. \u2047 Of course, I'm thrilled that we almost doubled operating profit from pre-pandemic levels this quarter, even in the midst of a challenging environment. \u2047 But first I want to mention how proud I am to be part of this team at Guess. \u2047 It's a team that works hard and works smart to execute our strategy and achieve our goals. \u2047 Now, let me take you through the details on the quarter. \u2047 Second quarter revenues were $629 million, up 58% to last year in U.S. dollars and 51% in constant currency. \u2047 We were down 8% compared to LOI. \u2047 This was slightly short of our expectations, as a result of timing in our European wholesale business worth about 4% to LLY, where delays in product receipts moved some shipments a few weeks into the third quarter. \u2047 Overall, the 8% revenue decline to LLY was driven by the impact of permanent store closures worth roughly 5% of revenue and the shift in wholesale shipments in Europe. \u2047 I want to note that our promotions were well below pre-pandemic levels across all of our direct-to-consumer businesses, which is impacting our sales level versus LLY, significantly driving our profit. \u2047 Let me get into a bit more detail on sales performance by segment. \u2047 In Americas Retail, revenues were down 6% versus LLY, better than our expectations. \u2047 This decline was entirely driven by permanent store closures, which were worth about 8% of the sales to LLY. \u2047 Store comps in the U.S. and Canada were up 5% in constant currency. \u2047 Same-store sales were solid positive in the U.S., but the recovery in Canada is moving a bit more slowly. \u2047 Although traffic is still materially negative, from"], "gold_summary": ["increases share repurchase authorization to $200 million.
