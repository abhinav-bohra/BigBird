retirement of debt of $53.2 million or $0.26 per diluted common share. \u2047 The after-tax amortization of the cost of reinsurance of $15.5 million or $0.08 per diluted common share, an after-tax impairment loss on the right-of-use asset related to one of our operating leases for office space we are no longer using to support our general operations of $11 million or $0.05 per diluted common share, a net after-tax realized investment gain on the company's investment portfolio of $600,000 or $0.01 per diluted common share and a net tax expense related to a U.K. tax rate increase of $24.2 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. \u2047 Net income in the second quarter of 2020 included an after-tax impairment loss on the right-of-use asset of $10 million or $0.05 per diluted common share and a net after-tax realized investment gain of $25.4 million or $0.12 per diluted common share. \u2047 So excluding these items, after-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2021 was $286.2 million or $1.39 per diluted common share compared to $250.1 million or $1.23 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter. \u2047 I am very pleased with our second quarter results. \u2047 We showed a 13% increase year-over-year in after-tax adjusted operating income to $1.39 per share. \u2047 These improved results were driven in large part by the significant decline in COVID-related mortality this quarter and by excellent performance in our investment portfolio. \u2047 Given our strong second quarter results, we are raising our outlook for full year 2021 growth in after-tax adjusted operating income per share to a decline of approximately 1% to 3% compared to our previous outlook of a decline of 5% to 6%. \u2047 We believe we're making good progress to returning to our pre-pandemic levels of profitability and margins over the coming quarters with the trajectory of that improvement dependent on the developing trends in COVID and the Delta variant. \u2047 Embedded in our expectations is that COVID mortality will improve but only slightly in the third and fourth quarters. \u2047 In many ways, results for this quarter played out in line with our expectations, with declining mortality impacts, solid underlying premium trends and further strengthening of our healthy capital position. \u2047 This quarter was also highlighted with some areas of positive upside relative to our expectations. \u2047 Most notably, we saw continued excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio, which is benefiting from the strong financial markets and growth in the economy. \u2047 We also saw a record level of quarterly operating income for Colonial Life along with an impressive recovery in sales. \u2047 And rounding it out, we had favorable underlying benefits experience from our Closed Block business lines, both long-term care and the Closed Disability Block. \u2047 In addition to the positive trends we saw this quarter, I am pleased that our indicators continue to support our expectation of generating slightly positive growth in premium income in our core business segments this year with further improvement expected into 2022. \u2047 Sales trends are emerging in line with our expectations at our primary business lines within Unum US. \u2047 And Colonial Life showed very strong results this quarter with over a 50% increase from the year ago quarter, a good indicator of consumer interest in the basic financial protection products we offer. \u2047 It also highlights that the agency model of Colonial Life is quite resilient as we saw some of the most pronounced headwinds in the early stages of the pandemic. \u2047 In addition to sales trends, we remain very encouraged with the strong levels of persistency we're seeing across the majority of our business, which provide a solid base to grow. \u2047 Finally, we're seeing a pickup in natural growth primarily from higher wages in many sectors of the economy as we continue to build back premium income that was impacted by the sharp spike in unemployment in the first half of 2020. \u2047 The environment we are seeing today is quite good for our core business. \u2047 We often talk about wage inflation, but you have to add to the mix there is renewed recognition for the need to prepare for the unexpected. \u2047 And in a competitive world for talent, employers are looking to ensure that they have competitive benefits package for their current and prospective employees. \u2047 Turning to our capital position at quarter end. \u2047 It remained very healthy as well, with holding company cash of $1.7 billion and weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional U.S. insurance companies at 375%. \u2047 Both of these measures are in excess of our targets and provide substantial flexibility for us going forward. \u2047 Additionally, this quarter, we successfully completed a 30-year debt issue and redeemed a shorter high-coupon maturity, enabling us to further extend our debt stack while reducing the overall coupon. \u2047 Leverage remains approximately 28% -- 26% and provides further capital flexibility for us. \u2047 This strong capital position creates options for us as we look to create value for our shareholders. \u2047 Our deployment strategy will first focus on continuing to invest in the growth of our core business segments, both organically and through capability-driven acquisitions. \u2047 We like our position in the employee benefits market, and putting money to work to grow our core franchise is where we are focused. \u2047 We also expect to be consistent in returning capital to shareholders through dividends, which will increase by 5.3% with the dividend to be paid this month. \u2047 We do have funds in excess of these needs, so as we look to the future, we are constantly evaluating how to best deploy or hold on to this capital. \u2047 A key question is how we can use these funds to lessen the challenge to our current share price from the overhang of our legacy LTC block. \u2047 Our goal is to help reduce the LTC discount in our stock. \u2047 And in the future, this funding would be utilized in any risk transfer transaction that we explore on a portion of this block should that become an option for us. \u2047 While we are clearly optimistic looking forward, we do see areas of our business that continue to be impacted by the pandemic. \u2047 Results in our short-term disability line and leave services continue to be impacted by COVID-related claims, which remains stubbornly high. \u2047 The group life and AD&D business within Unum U.S. returned to profitability in the second quarter after recording losses in the previous two quarters as COVID-related mortality in the U.S. declined materially from the peak levels experienced late last year through the early months of 2021. \u2047 What we are watching now is that the Delta variant is impacting a younger, unvaccinated population that has different dynamics from what we have seen to date from COVID-19. \u2047 Recently updated estimates for COVID-related mortality for the third quarter and second half of 2021 are pointing to persistently high counts and only a marginal improvement relative to the second quarter. \u2047 We continue to watch these trends closely and are reflecting them in our own plans. \u2047 There is room for optimism, though, as we have started to see employers looking at the role that they might play in getting more of the population vaccinated. \u2047 As we look at growth in our enterprise, the steps we're taking -- we've taken to run our business more efficiently have freed up funds that we're reinvesting in new products and capabilities that tackle some of today's critical business workplace challenges. \u2047 During the quarter, we launched our new Total Leave and behavioral health solutions, and we've logged our first sales for both offerings. \u2047 On the digital front, platforms like My Unum and Colonial Life's improved portal are steadily providing more self-service, real-time capabilities for clients and customers. \u2047 And new technology we're testing will enhance the digital enrollment experience, automate processes and allow people to interact with us in new ways. \u2047 Equally important is the work we're doing to strengthen our culture and engage our employees across the enterprise. \u2047 We've taken steps during the quarter to accelerate and expand our inclusion and diversity journey, and we broaden the scope of our social justice fund to support even more groups facing discrimination. \u2047 These and many other efforts help place Unum among the Points of Light, Civic 50, and in Forbes Best Employers for Diversity, Best Employers for Women and Best Employers for New Graduates. \u2047 We're also happy to receive another perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to be named a best place to work for disability inclusion. \u2047 These efforts and accomplishments reflect the strong culture we have built. \u2047 We are proud of how it has helped us endure through the challenges of the past 1.5 years and how the engagement of our team will propel us going forward. \u2047 Now I'll ask Steve to cover the details of the second quarter results. \u2047 I'll start with the Unum US segment, which reported adjusted operating income for the second quarter of $179.3 million compared to $115.7 million in the first quarter. \u2047 These results improved significantly due to the improvement in COVID-related mortality in our group life business line, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment. \u2047 We also saw improved operating income from the supplemental and voluntary line, while income in the group disability line declined compared to the first quarter. \u2047 Within the Unum US segment, the group disability line reported operating income of $59.9 million in the second quarter compared to $64.1 million in the first quarter. \u2047 The primary driver of the change was lower net investment income, which largely resulted from a lower level of on calls. \u2047 Premium income was generally consistent between the two quarters and on a year-over-year basis increased 1.1%. \u2047 The group disability benefit ratio for the second quarter was 74.7%, which is consistent with the first quarter benefit ratio of 74.8%. \u2047 We feel the benefit ratio will likely remain at this level over the near term due to the impacts we are seeing from COVID in the Delta variant, which we now believe will likely persist through the second half of the year. \u2047 Adjusted operating income for Unum US group life and AD&D showed a sharp improvement in the second quarter to income of $5.2 million compared to a loss of $58.3 million in the first quarter. \u2047 This improvement is consistent with our expectations and largely explained by the significant reduction in COVID-related mortality in the U.S., which declined from approximately 200,000 nationwide observed deaths in the first quarter to approximately 52,000 in the second quarter. \u2047 We estimate that we incurred approximately 800 excess claims from COVID in the second quarter compared to an estimate of 2,050 COVID claims in the first quarter. \u2047 Our average size of claim increased in the second quarter by approximately 10% as we experienced a mix shift to a more younger, working-age policyholders who typically have higher benefit amounts. \u2047 Non-COVID-related mortality had little impact on results this quarter relative to the first quarter as lower incidents was offset by higher average claim size. \u2047 Now looking ahead to the third quarter, our current expectation for nationwide COVID related mortality of approximately 40,000 compared to approximately 52,000 experienced in the second quarter. \u2047 Assuming the shift in the mix continues to more younger, working-age individuals with a continued higher average benefit amount, we would estimate third quarter group life operating income to show a modest improvement over second quarter results to approximately $15 million. \u2047 We are closely watching the impacts emerging from the COVID variants, which have led to increase in estimates for second half mortality expectations. \u2047 Now shifting to the Unum US supplemental and voluntary lines. \u2047 We saw an improved quarter with adjusted operating income of $114.2 million in the second quarter compared to $109.9 million in the first quarter. \u2047 Looking at the three primary business lines. \u2047 First, we remain very pleased with the performance of the individual disability recently issued block of business both in the second quarter and throughout the pandemic. \u2047 Though the benefit ratio did increase to 48.4% in the second quarter from 42.4% in the first quarter, it continues to perform quite well compared to our pre-pandemic experience as new claim incidence trends and recovery levels remain favorable. \u2047 The voluntary benefits line recorded a strong level of income as well. \u2047 The benefit ratio increased in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, though it did remain consistent with the pre-pandemic results. \u2047 The benefit ratio in the group critical illness line increased, offsetting the improved experience in the life lines of business. \u2047 And then finally, utilization in the dental and vision line was higher this quarter, as was the average cost per procedure, pushing the benefit ratio to 77.1% in the second quarter compared to 73.2% in the first quarter. \u2047 Dental and vision utilization has been volatile since the significant decline in utilization we did experience in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Sales for Unum US in total declined 3.1% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to a decline of 10.3% in the first quarter. \u2047 For the employee benefit lines, which include LTD, STD, group life, AD&D and stop loss, total sales declined by 3.1% this quarter. \u2047 We saw good activity and results in the core markets for group disability and group life. \u2047 While large case sales were down year-over-year, we are seeing a good level of quote activity in the group markets, which is back to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Sales trends in our supplemental and voluntary lines showed similar improvement in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. \u2047 For this quarter, total sales declined 3.1% year-over-year compared to the 22.3% decline in the first quarter. \u2047 Our recently issued individual disability sales increased 4.9%, and dental and vision sales increased 2.4% year-over-year. \u2047 Voluntary benefit sales were down 7% in the quarter, which is consistent with our view that these sales will take longer to recover. \u2047 Large case DB sales in particular have a longer sales cycle and are more concentrated around January one effective date. \u2047 Persistency for our major product lines in Unum US remained in line to higher this quarter relative to the first quarter of 2020, providing a good tailwind for premium growth for the full year and into 2022. \u2047 We have also seen favorable trends and natural growth in our employee benefits lines primarily from higher wage growth at this point. \u2047 Now moving to the Unum International segment. \u2047 Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $24.8 million compared to $26.4 million in the first quarter and $15.1 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 The primary driver of"], "gold_summary": ["unum group q2 adjusted operating earnings per share $1.39.  \u2047  q2 adjusted operating earnings per share
