{"article": ["The team at Union Pacific continued to demonstrate their capability, as we moved increasing volumes while dealing with challenging capacity constraints in some of our important supply chains. \u2047 The result was the team delivered all-time record financial results. \u2047 Our employees are making good on our strategy to serve, grow and win together. \u2047 This compares to $1.1 billion or $1.67 per share in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 While comparisons to the second quarter of last year are skewed by the COVID impact, a comparison to 2019 further demonstrates the impressive results we achieved during the quarter. \u2047 Our quarterly operating ratio of 55.1% is an all-time record. \u2047 In addition, we set quarterly records for operating income, net income and earnings per share. \u2047 These records highlight how the team is running the Union Pacific franchise to deliver results, as we pulled all three profitability levers simultaneously, volume price and productivity. \u2047 The second quarter also marked an important milestone in our quest to reduce our carbon footprint, as we achieved a second quarter best fuel consumption rate. \u2047 Locomotive fuel efficiency is the critical element to achieving our goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \u2047 And we're helping our customers achieve their ESG goals too, as they eliminated 5.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the quarter, by using rail versus truck. \u2047 While, our financial results were impressive in the second quarter, our customers felt the impact of intermodal supply chain disruptions and costly rail equipment incidents. \u2047 Within the intermodal space, we've taken numerous actions to mitigate the customer impact, and are actively working with all parties in the supply chain. \u2047 Even so, it's likely these issues will persist through the end of the year, as the capacity to move boxes from our ramp to the final destination falls short of demand. \u2047 Relative to rail equipment incidents, while the number and rate improved their impact on the network was notable. \u2047 We're redoubling our efforts to utilize best-in-class technology, training, and root cause analysis to keep our crews, our customers and our communities safe. \u2047 To that end, we'll start with Eric and an update on our operations. \u2047 While we don't see these events impacting us long-term, there's real work to be done to get past them. \u2047 Moving to Slide 4, taking a look at our key performance metrics for the quarter. \u2047 It's important to note that year-over-year comparisons are a little skewed. \u2047 2020 included a couple historically low volume months at the start of the pandemic. \u2047 So as Lance said, we've provided a 2019 comparison to give a little more context to more normal, seasonal volumes. \u2047 Freight car velocity improved from 2019 due to the execution of PSR principles that reduced freight car terminal dwell and improved train speeds. \u2047 However, we still have work to do to return to running a more fluid network, with the goal to return this metric back to the 220 to 230 miles per day range, we achieved earlier this year. \u2047 As you can see, our service reliability as measured by trip planned compliance has improved over the time in both service categories. \u2047 However, current quarterly metrics do not meet our expectations or that of our customers. \u2047 Disruptions in the international supply chains especially in the intermodal space have impacted our network significantly. \u2047 At the expense of our own service metrics, we chose to help reduce port congestion by moving more assets into dock operations. \u2047 But that West Coast port congestion has now moved east, and is affecting some of our inland terminals, most notably in Chicago. \u2047 We are working proactively with our commercial team and ocean carrier customers to address the congestion, while continuing to sustain shipment volumes, to and from the ports. \u2047 To help alleviate the congestion and maintain fluidity, we also temporarily reopened Global III in Chicago for use as an inland storage. \u2047 We are also working with our customers to develop additional storage and transportation options. \u2047 We will continue to work with all members of the supply chain, our ocean carrier customers, beneficial cargo owners, port operators, chassis providers, and dray carriers to mean the fluidity of international freight flows. \u2047 During the first-half, our network has been impacted by weather and costly rail equipment incidents as well. \u2047 We have made good progress on reducing the frequency of rail incidents. \u2047 However, the location of a couple of the incidents occurring on our East West main corridor, and our sunset route had a notable effect on both intermodal and manifest auto trip planned compliance measures. \u2047 Ultimately, we recognize the importance of improving these metrics to support our customers and our long-term growth strategy. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5, we continue to make good progress in our efficiency measures, as both locomotive and workforce productivity improved in the quarter. \u2047 Improvement in locomotive productivity was the result of running an efficient transportation plan that requires fewer locomotives. \u2047 Workforce productivity was an all-time quarterly record, driven by an increase in daily car miles of more than 20%, while workforce levels remained flat. \u2047 These improvements were also driven by our continued focus on growing train linked, which has grown by 9% since the second quarter 2020 to just over 9,400 feet. \u2047 Increasing and more consistent volumes provide the team with more optionality to adjust transportation plans. \u2047 We will continue to focus on train length to run a more efficient and reliable railroad for our customers. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6, one driver of the continued increase in train length is our siding extension program. \u2047 Through the first-half of the year, we've completed seven sidings and began construction or the bidding process on more than 20 additional sidings. \u2047 Through growing train size, other productivity initiatives and technology, our fuel consumption rate was a second quarter record, improving 3% compared to last year. \u2047 The operating department understands the important role we play in achieving our long-term greenhouse gas emission goals. \u2047 Wrapping up on Slide 7, the entire team is focused on performing our work safer every day. \u2047 Year-to-date, our safety results have been mixed. \u2047 Real equipment incidents have decreased, but personal injuries increased. \u2047 To address personal injuries, we are maturing our peer-to-peer safety programs, which is a continuation and next level of our Courage-to-Care program. \u2047 Recently, our network has been impacted by wildfires in Northern California. \u2047 Our Dry Canyon Bridge north of Redding, California sustained significant structural damage. \u2047 The team is working around the clock to repair the bridge. \u2047 Current projections have a reopening in late August. \u2047 We are actively rerouting traffic in that area, which requires additional crew and locomotive resources, as well as adding transit time to those customer shipments. \u2047 Ultimately, I have the utmost confidence that we will guide our network through these transitory challenges, and return our service product to the level our customers expect and deserve. \u2047 The team did an excellent job during the quarter and how efficiently we added volume to our network. \u2047 PSR remains our guiding principle and the improvements you've seen, and our productivity and operating efficiency speaks to that commitment. \u2047 Our ability to be far more volume variable with our cost structure is a testament to our employees who execute the plan every day. \u2047 Our second quarter volume was up 22% from a year ago, as all of our major markets improved from the economic shutdown that we saw from the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 Freight revenue was up 29%, due to the volume increase coupled with a higher fuel surcharge and core pricing gains. \u2047 We clearly have easy comp this quarter versus last year. \u2047 In order to provide a little more color into the current business, I will also share our sequential comparison to the first quarter, as I walk through each of the business groups. \u2047 So, let's get started with our bulk commodity. \u2047 Revenue for the quarter was up 19% compared to last year, driven by a 13% increase in volume, and a 5% increase in average revenue per car, reflecting core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue. \u2047 Coal and renewable carloads grew 6% year-over-year and 14% from the first quarter, due to higher natural gas prices supporting domestic coal demand, Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter, as well as increased coal exports. \u2047 Grain and grain products were up 22% year-over-year due to the strength in both domestic and export grain. \u2047 Ethanol shipments also continue to improve as production recovers from COVID-related shutdown. \u2047 Fertilizer carloads were up 2% year-over-year and 23% from the first quarter, due to strong agricultural demand and seasonality of fertilizer applications. \u2047 And finally, food and refrigerated volume was up 17% year-over-year and 7% from the first quarter, driven primarily by higher consumer demand, as the economy recovers from COVID, along with increased growth from truck penetration. \u2047 Moving on to industrial, industrial revenue improved 24% for the quarter, driven by a 15% increase in volume, coupled with an 8% increase in average revenue per car from a positive mix of traffic, core pricing gains and a higher fuel surcharge. \u2047 Energy and specialized shipments were up 20% year-over-year, but we're down 1% compared to the first quarter, as strength in specialized shipments were offset by fewer crude oil shipments, and seasonal LPG demand. \u2047 Forest products continue to be a bright spot, as second quarter volumes grew 28% year-over-year and 7% over the first quarter. \u2047 Lumber drove this increase from strong housing start, repairing remodels, along with further penetration from product moving over the road. \u2047 Industrial chemicals and plastics shipments were up 11% for both year-over-year and the first quarter comparison. \u2047 The sequential growth was driven by the recovery of the Gulf Coast production rates from the February storm and improved demand. \u2047 Metals and minerals volumes was up 12% year-over-year and 25% from the first quarter, driven by increased rock shipments and stronger steel demand, as the industrial sectors recover. \u2047 Turning now to Premium, revenue for the quarter was up 50% on a 31% increase in volume. \u2047 Average revenue per car increased by 14% from higher fuel surcharge revenue, positive mix of traffic and core pricing gains. \u2047 Automotive volume was up 119% year-over-year, but down 4% compared to the first quarter, driven by shortages for semiconductor-related parts. \u2047 Intermodal volume increased by 21% year-over-year, and 10% from the first quarter. \u2047 Domestic intermodal improved from continuous strength in retail sales and recent business wins, parcel in particular, benefited from the ongoing strength in e-commerce. \u2047 International intermodal saw continued strength in containerize import, despite congestion in the overall global supply chain. \u2047 Now, looking ahead to the back-half of 2021. \u2047 Starting out with our bulk commodities, we expect coal to remain stable for the remainder of the year, based on the current natural gas futures as well as export demand. \u2047 Our food and refrigerated shipments should continue to be strong, as the nation recovers from COVID coupled with truck penetration wins. \u2047 We're also optimistic with our grain products business, as ethanol shipments will improve from increased consumer demand, and our focus in growing the renewable diesel market. \u2047 Lastly, while we see positive signs for the upcoming grain harvest and strengthen export demand, we expect tight supply in the third quarter, as well as top year-over-year comparisons in the back-half of the year. \u2047 As we look ahead to our industrial commodities, the year-over-year comps for our energy market are favorable. \u2047 However, there is still uncertainty with crew plans supporting crew by warehouse shipments. \u2047 We continue to be encouraged by the strength and the industrial production forecast for the rest of 2021, which will positively impact many of our markets. \u2047 In addition, forest product volume will remain strong for us in the second-half of the year. \u2047 And lastly for premium, automotive sales are forecasted to increase from 14 million units in 2020 to almost 17 million in 2021. \u2047 However, we are keeping a watchful eye on the supply chain issues for parts related to the semiconductor chip. \u2047 Now switching to intermodal, on the international side we expect demand to remain strong through the rest of the year. \u2047 The entire supply chain continues to be constrained by most notably to haul away our containers from our inland ramp. \u2047 But I've been pleased with the collaboration between our commercial and operating teams, as we work together to create solutions for our international customers to improve service and network fluidity. \u2047 With regard to domestic intermodal, limited truck capacity will encourage conversion from over the road to rail, tampered by constraint on chassis supply. \u2047 Retail inventories remained historically low, and restocking of inventory along with continued strength in the sales should drive intermodal volumes higher for the remainder of this year. \u2047 Overall, I'm encouraged by the improving economic outlook, but more importantly, by our commercial teams' intensity and ability to win in the marketplace. \u2047 As you heard from Lance, Union Pacific recorded record second quarter financials with earnings per share of $2.72 and an operating ratio of 55.1%. \u2047 Rise in fuel prices throughout the quarter and the two month lag on our fuel surcharge programs, negatively impacted our quarterly ratio by 210 basis points, and earnings per share by $0.04. \u2047 Below the line, our previously announced real estate gain and a lower effective tax rate associated with reduced corporate tax rates in three states added $0.13 to earnings per share. \u2047 Partially offsetting that good news in 2021 is a real estate gain of $0.08 recorded in last year second quarter. \u2047 Setting aside the impact of one-time items and fuel, UP's core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 800 basis points, and added $1.04 to earnings per share. \u2047 These results are a clear demonstration of how we are positioned to efficiently leverage volume growth to the bottom-line. \u2047 Looking now at our second quarter income statement on Slide 15, where we're showing a comparison of this quarter's results to second quarter 2020, as well as 2019. \u2047 This is to provide additional context to our results by comparing periods with more normal seasonal volume levels. \u2047 For perspective, seven day car loadings in the second quarter of 2019 were almost 166,000, versus only 133,000 in 2020, and then rebounding this year to 163,000. \u2047 So, not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 For second quarter 2021, the combination of operating revenue up 30% and operating expense only up 17%, illustrates our efficient handling of volume growth to produce record quarterly operating income of $2.5 billion. \u2047 Net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share also were quarterly records. \u2047 Looking more closely"], "gold_summary": ["q2 earnings per share $2.72.  \u2047  qtrly business volumes, as measured by total revenue carloads,
