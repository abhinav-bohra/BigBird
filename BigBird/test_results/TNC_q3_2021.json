{"article": ["I'm William Prate, Senior Director of Global Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. \u2047 Dave will brief you on our operations and enterprise strategy, and Fay will cover the financials. \u2047 After their remarks, we will open the call to questions. \u2047 The risks and uncertainties are described in today's news release and the documents we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u2047 We encourage you to review those, particularly our Safe Harbor statement, for a description of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our results. \u2047 Additionally, on this conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures that include or exclude certain items. \u2047 Our third quarter results reflect the returns of pre-pandemic demand across the majority of our geographic markets and verticals. \u2047 Our comprehensive and innovative product offerings are resonating with customers during this broad-based market recovery, and we expect this demand environment to continue for the foreseeable future. \u2047 While we are certainly encouraged by these positive trends, our financial performance continued to be impacted by the unexpected and prolonged global supply disruptions, inflation and labor constraints that have affected virtually every industry and geographic markets. \u2047 The increased demand for our products combined with the effect of macro level constraints on our production capabilities contributed to a record order backlog that varies by product category or region and is now 3 to 5 times our historical averages. \u2047 In response, we've taken actions wherever possible to minimize the impact on our operations. \u2047 Our plants continue to remain open and operate due to the significant efforts by our global teams to maximize output and to safeguard our customers' experience. \u2047 While we expect that these macro headwinds will continue well into 2022, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term sustainable growth and improve our operational efficiencies to generate long-term value for our shareholders. \u2047 We are doing so not only through short-term mitigation actions, but also to the changes we've made and continue to make as part of our enterprise strategy. \u2047 To minimize the impact of higher freight costs and related supply disruptions, we continue to prioritize local-for-local and region-for-region manufacturing and sourcing to allow us to manufacture our products closer to our customers. \u2047 As an example, we are making the necessary investments to add production of our T16 line to our China plants mid next year. \u2047 The T16 is a highly maneuverable battery-operated ride-on scrubber that has proven to be very popular with our customers within the APAC region. \u2047 By adding production to the local market, we can help minimize freight costs, improve lead times and better leverage our global production capacity. \u2047 We have continued to make capital investments to drive greater efficiency and capacity in all of our plants. \u2047 As just one example, we have invested in the new lays in our Minneapolis plant that will improve production flow, reduce the amount of labor spent machining parts and will allow us to in-source items that we would have otherwise purchased from vendors. \u2047 New tooling, specifically tooling related to our rotational molding machines, is another example of how we are investing in our business to support our local-for-local initiatives. \u2047 This lets us manufacture key components at the point of assembly, meaning, we can avoid situations where we manufacture in one location before shipping to a second location for final assembly. \u2047 These actions help avoid unnecessary shipping delays, freight costs, added time to manufacture and inventory carrying costs. \u2047 While our teams are taking every opportunity to find creative solutions to address the current supply chain environment, each day brings new challenges in terms of parts availability. \u2047 Right now, the lack of availability of hydraulic pumps, chips and other electronic components, which are critical parts within our machines, are main drivers of our increased backlog and are directly affecting our ability to deliver on our full year potential. \u2047 However, we will continue to control everything we can control and work diligently to capitalize on the strong demand environment. \u2047 An important component of our enterprise strategy is a long-term move toward platform design. \u2047 In the current environment, our engineering teams are taking a balanced approach to this initiative as they weigh the long-term benefits of platform design with the near-term need to adjust our designs to allow for available parts and to increase our sourcing flexibility. \u2047 Of course, our commitment to quality and safety and meeting the needs of our customers will not waiver. \u2047 Regarding labor shortage, specifically in manufacturing, we are staying competitive with wages and are making every effort to attract new talent by providing a safe, rewarding and fulfilling work environment. \u2047 We are also supplementing and strengthening our talent acquisition teams by partnering with third-party vendors to assist with our employment outreach through targeted marketing campaigns and professionally staged hiring events. \u2047 We are encouraged by these actions which are having a positive effect on our recruiting and helping to mitigate the ongoing labor challenges. \u2047 As Fay will discuss, while our revised full year guidance reflects what continues to be a challenging operating environment, our team remains committed to meeting the needs of our customers and executing against our enterprise strategy to deliver on our long-term financial commitments. \u2047 In particular, we continue to innovate for profitable growth, which is the third pillar of our enterprise strategy. \u2047 Over the past year, we've announced the introduction of new products to help address the evolving needs of our customers. \u2047 Earlier this year, we introduced new mid-tier products, which leverage our IPC product portfolio, to meet the needs of a broader segment of customers by offering a wider range of performance and price points. \u2047 Our mid-tier products have been well received by our customers and distributors. \u2047 While they leverage the same IPC platform, these Tennant-branded products benefit from the broader customer experience associated with the Tennant brand, including the full ecosystem of application expertise, technological innovations and best-in-class sales and service support. \u2047 During the past year, we've also introduced two key new products to our AMR portfolio, including the T380AMR and the T16AMR. Together with the T7AMR, these products have created a comprehensive robotic portfolio to meet all of our customers' needs. \u2047 With the addition of these new products, we have been able to strategically enter new verticals outside of just retail, including manufacturing, logistics and warehousing and education, among others. \u2047 Our AMR portfolio continues to be well received by an expanding number of customers, and we look forward to updating you on a number of other AMR innovations as they materialize. \u2047 The one strategic pillar I haven't yet touched on is winning where we have a competitive advantage. \u2047 For example, we recently launched a value realization exercise in Australia building on our successful North American execution back in 2019 where we assessed all of our strategic accounts and distributor partners. \u2047 In Australia, this allowed us to realign over 40% of our strategic account customers and 80% of our distributor partnerships, ensuring that we have an optimized channel structure in place to serve this highly competitive market. \u2047 By adjusting our customer segmentation appropriately, we can better adjust lead times, pricing and sales support across our customer base. \u2047 In doing so, we are aligning the customer experience with our profitability goals. \u2047 Moreover, we are relentlessly focused on providing our customers with high quality products and exceptional service as we execute on our enterprise strategy. \u2047 With that goal in mind, we will continue to take decisive and appropriate actions to maintain our customer experience, while remaining focused on our business objectives. \u2047 For the third quarter of 2021, Tennant reported net sales of $272 million, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year, which included a favorable foreign currency effect of 1.2% and a divestiture impact of negative 2% related to the sale of our Coatings business in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 Organic sales, which exclude the impact of these currency effects and divestitures, increased 4.7%. \u2047 As Dave mentioned, our revenue results were tempered by the continued global supply chain disruptions and labor constraints, with North America being the most affected. \u2047 Tennant groups its sales into three geographies. \u2047 The Americas, which include all of North America and Latin America. \u2047 EMEA, which covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \u2047 And Asia Pacific, which includes China, Japan, Australia and other Asian market. \u2047 In the third quarter, sales in the Americas decreased 0.6% year-over-year, which included a negative divestiture impact of 3.1%, organic growth of 2% and a favorable foreign exchange effect of 0.5%. \u2047 Strong customer demand in Brazil and Mexico drove a year-over-year increase in sales in Latin America. \u2047 North America delivered modest organic growth as compared to the prior year, due to the previously mentioned supply chain and labor challenges as well as the lapping of the significant AMR order in the prior year. \u2047 Additionally, the current year period benefited from an increase in our service, parts and consumables businesses. \u2047 Sales in EMEA increased 16.1% or 14% organically, including a favorable foreign exchange effect of 2.1%. \u2047 The results which were impacted by global supply chain challenges reflected growth across all countries and product categories in the region as demand returned to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Sales in APAC decreased 0.4% or 2.9% on an organic basis and included a positive foreign exchange effect of 2.7% and a negative revenue impact of 0.2% related to the sale of the Coatings business. \u2047 The sales decline was partially attributed to pandemic-related lockdowns in some regional markets during the third quarter of 2021. \u2047 Supply chain disruptions and labor constraints impacting North America plants that supply APAC also limited our ability to meet orders across the region with the largest impact experienced in China and Japan. \u2047 Even so, the region experienced strong results for parts and consumables and service with strength in the Australian market across all product categories. \u2047 Reported and adjusted gross margin in the third quarter were both 40.1% compared to a reported gross margin of 39.6% and adjusted gross margin of 39.8% in this year ago period. \u2047 Although the comparison to the prior year was favorable, the year ago period was unfavorably impacted by certain strategic investments and pandemic-related productivity challenges. \u2047 As we highlighted during our last conference call, our third quarter adjusted gross margin was lower than the adjusted gross margin in the first half of 2021. \u2047 This decrease was primarily due to increased material and freight costs and productivity challenges caused by parts availability. \u2047 As for expenses, during the third quarter, our adjusted S&A expenses were 28.3% of net sales compared to 29.3% in the year ago period. \u2047 The year-over-year improvement in leverage was a direct result of the cost saving actions as well as the adjustment of management incentives in Q3 of 2021 to better reflect current expectations. \u2047 Net income in the third quarter was $21.5 million or $1.14 per diluted share compared to $11.7 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the year ago period. \u2047 Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude non-operational items and amortization expense was $1.33 per share compared to $0.90 per share in the year ago period. \u2047 The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by lower interest expense and increased business performance. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased to $36 million or 13.2% of sales compared to $32.6 million or 12.4% of sales in Q3 of last year. \u2047 The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by increased revenues based on strong demand as we continue to lap the pandemic-related slowdown of 2020 as well as improved gross margins and an adjustment of management incentives previously mentioned. \u2047 As for our tax rate, in the third quarter, Tennant had an adjusted effective tax rate excluding non-recurring expenses of 3.8% compared to 11.3% for the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven primarily by a tax benefit resulting from an election to step-up the tax basis of certain assets in Italy. \u2047 Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. \u2047 Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investment in growth, appropriately managed leverage, pursue strategic and accretive M&A and then to return excess free cash flow over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $140.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and our net leverage of 0.93 times adjusted EBITDA is lower than our stated goal of 1.5 to 2.5 times. \u2047 Cash flow from operations was strong with $25.1 million generated in the third quarter and $62.9 million generated on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 Additionally, capex is approximately $12 million for the first nine months of the year. \u2047 Our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to return capital to shareholders through the following actions. \u2047 First, and as previously announced, Tennant's Board of Directors has authorized a 9% increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share. \u2047 The increased dividend is payable on December 15, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2021, marking the 50th consecutive year that the company has increased its annual cash dividend. \u2047 Secondly, during the third quarter, Tennant repurchased approximately 102,000 shares of its common stock for $7.5 million under its existing share repurchase program. \u2047 The increase in the dividend and our share repurchase activities are aligned with our long-term capital allocation priorities and display continued confidence in our ongoing business performance and future cash flow generation. \u2047 Lastly, turning to guidance. \u2047 As included in today's earnings announcement, Tennant adjust its full year guidance for 2021 as follows. \u2047 Net sales of $1.09 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting organic sales growth of 9% to 10%. \u2047 Full year reported GAAP earnings in the range of $3.50 to $3.70 per diluted share. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.40 per diluted share. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA of $137 million to $142 million. \u2047 Capital expenditures of approximately $20 million. \u2047 And an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 15%. \u2047 The challenges we're facing with global supply chain and labor shortages are not unique to Tennant and are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. \u2047 These challenges did have a direct impact on our Q3 results and our ability to meet our full potential in 2021. \u2047 However, we are encouraged by the strong response to our innovative suite of products and the market recovery that is now at pre-pandemic levels of demand. \u2047 Our continued execution of our enterprise strategy has enabled us to better navigate to continued macro challenges facing the overall economy. \u2047 But more importantly, the strategic actions we've taken over the past couple of years will"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $1.33.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $1.14.  \u2047  sees fy gaap
