{"article": ["I'm Rebecca Gardy, Head of Investor Relations at Campbell Soup Company. \u2047 Today's remarks have been prerecorded. \u2047 These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. \u2047 On Slide 4, you will see today's agenda. \u2047 Mark will share his overall thoughts on our fourth quarter and full year performance, as well as end market performance by division. \u2047 Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter and the year in more detail and then provide our guidance for the full year fiscal 2022. \u2047 In fiscal 2021, the pandemic continued to present challenges across North America. \u2047 But I am so proud of how our teams, particularly our front-line and supply chain teams adapted and rallied to keep each other safe and meet the sustained demand for our products. \u2047 On behalf of the entire Campbell leadership team, I am deeply grateful for their dedication and we continue to make their safety and well-being paramount as they work to meet the needs of our customers, consumers and our communities. \u2047 As difficult and complex as this time has been, it has also been an extraordinary period for Campbell, and we've made clear meaningful progress advancing our strategic plan. \u2047 We've evolved into a different company, one that is stronger, more agile and with growing more relevant brands that are better positioned for the future. \u2047 For the full year, I'm pleased to report that Campbell's organic net sales were comparable to fiscal 2020 and grew 3% on a two-year compounded annual growth basis driven by both divisions, reflecting strong end market performance. \u2047 In fact, three quarters of our portfolio grew or held market share for the year, reflecting our continued momentum. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT lagged fiscal 2020 as we lapped dramatic scale and efficiency from a year ago, and navigated a much higher inflationary environment this year. \u2047 However, on a two-year CAGR, adjusted EBIT grew 5% and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% as we de-levered and improved our balance sheet. \u2047 Turning to Slide 7, full-year organic net sales were comparable to prior year, which included a positive fourth quarter finish to fiscal 2021 in light of last year's remarkably strong performance. \u2047 If you recall, our first half fiscal 2021 was driven by strong elevated end market performance as we continue to gain share and made steady progress on supply to restore the shelf. \u2047 The third quarter reflected the challenging comparisons to the prior year as we cycle the demand surge that accompanied the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and navigated several headwinds, including increased inflation and executional pressures in our Snacks division. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid results ahead of our expectations across all three key metrics: net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, and addressed the executional pressures we experienced last quarter. \u2047 Organic net sales declined 4% as we lapped a 12% growth than the prior year and delivered 4% growth on a two-year CAGR basis. \u2047 Our fourth quarter performance accelerated relative to third quarter, driven by strong end market results, particularly in US Soup and Goldfish, and the continued recovery of our foodservice business. \u2047 In Snacks, we delivered sequential operating margin improvement of 270 basis points versus the third quarter despite the continued industry wide supply chain challenges. \u2047 An important barometer of the health of our brand portfolio is our end market performance. \u2047 For the full year, 75% of our brands grew or held share versus the prior year, and the majority of our brands in our 13 core categories grew ahead of pre-COVID levels. \u2047 To note, repeat rates on our brands in all core categories are ahead on a two-year basis. \u2047 Total company in-market consumption was minus 1% compared to fiscal 2020, on a 52-week basis. \u2047 Importantly, compared to the fiscal 2019 period, consumption grew 10%, driven equally by strength in both our Meals and Beverages and Snacks divisions, as we continue to make material advances in attracting and retaining consumers, especially the critical Millennial cohort. \u2047 Turning to our division performance on slide 9, let me begin with Meals & Beverages. \u2047 Our 4th quarter organic net sales decline of 9% and end market performance of minus 2% reflects cycling the partial inventory recovery and elevated consumption levels in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we continued to grow share in Swanson broth, condensed soup, Prego, ready to serve soup and Pacific Foods. \u2047 On a two-year basis, we delivered strong consumption growth of 13% against organic net sales growth of 10%, narrowing the gap as our foodservice business continued to stabilize. \u2047 On US Soup, we delivered another quarter of record share growth of nearly 2 points, with gains in all segments. \u2047 This included gains from Swanson broth, condensed soup, Well Yes! \u2047 and Slow Kettle driven by the continued recovery in our total points of distribution or TPDs. \u2047 Our share of TPDs grew for the fourth consecutive quarter this year. \u2047 US Soup two-year dollar sales growth of 16% in the fourth quarter exceeded the growth in total shelf stable meals and was just slightly behind total edible growth in that same time period. \u2047 Household penetration and repeat rates remain elevated compared to pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Condensed soup increased dollar share for the 10th consecutive quarter with the largest driver of share growth coming from condensed eating varieties as we nearly restored the full range of offerings to the shelf. \u2047 As our ability to supply improved, we were also pleased to see household gains and ready to serve versus the prior year as a result of the shelf recovery, and favorable at-home consumption behaviors particularly for lunch occasions. \u2047 Ready to serve end market consumption grew an impressive 21% on a two-year basis, led by Chunky, Slow Kettle and the successful relaunch of Well Yes! \u2047 Pacific Foods continues to strengthen its position as the number one organic soup brand with the fourth quarter marking seven straight quarters of share gains in measured channels. \u2047 We expanded distribution and have recovered the majority of our supply, while bringing in more millennials to the category than any other soup or broth brands. \u2047 On Swanson broth, we increased our share by 3.7 points, our highest quarter of share growth in over three years, driven by our investment in supply recovery. \u2047 This is important as it demonstrates the strength of the brand as we recovered lost share to lower priced players as our supply improved. \u2047 Prego delivered its best year of dollar share gains in four years and maintained the number one share position for 27 consecutive months. \u2047 The brand grew in market consumption on a two-year basis and delivered 5% growth over the prior year. \u2047 Household penetration was elevated versus fiscal 2019 in every quarter and grew 1 points in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Overall, the Meals & Beverages division delivered strong end market performance against difficult comparisons to the prior year and achieved share gains in key categories, particularly with millennials. \u2047 On Slide 11, we are excited to share with you a glimpse into our Meals & Beverages innovation plans for fiscal 2022. \u2047 Our new items focus on new occasions and relevant wellness trends, expanding on the relaunch of our better for you Well Yes! \u2047 brand is the launch of Well Yes! \u2047 Power Bowls with five unique varieties for both lunch and snack occasions. \u2047 We have also expanded our successful Slow Kettle Crunch innovation with four varieties of Campbell's red and white Crunch including our iconic classic tomato soup with Goldfish toppings. \u2047 On our Pacific Foods business, we are launching additional plant-based products, including creamy oat milk soups and creamy plant based protein broths. \u2047 Finally, if you haven't tried the new chunky spicy chicken noodle it's fantastic and brings variety to the critical at-home lunch occasion. \u2047 In addition to our relevant and consumer-driven innovation, another element of our winning soup strategy is a refresh of our Campbell's condensed soup. \u2047 We are contemporizing the brand to better match our growing millennial consumer base, while improving the product and its shopability as we continue to support our positioning as a starting point for delicious meals. \u2047 We also have continued our journey of simplifying our ingredient lines and improving quality. \u2047 It's always tricky when looking to evolve such an iconic design and product but our new graphics and improved ingredient line strike the right balance and have been met with a very positive customer and consumer response. \u2047 Let's now turn to Snacks. \u2047 This quarter was the second highest 13-week quarter of net sales for the Snacks division since the Snyder's-Lance acquisition. \u2047 Organic net sales grew 1% over the prior year quarter and 7% on a two-year basis. \u2047 In-market performance declined only 1% year-over-year, but grew 11% on a two-year basis. \u2047 Turning to our Snacks Power brands, which continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 2% this fiscal year and 15% on a two-year basis driven by double-digit consumption growth in the majority of our brands. \u2047 Compared to the prior year, we grew share on many of our power brands, most notably Cape Cod potato chips, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Goldfish Crackers and Late July snacks. \u2047 Compared to pre-COVID levels, household penetration remains elevated and repeat rates are higher on all Power brands. \u2047 Turning to Goldfish, we delivered sustained share growth, increasing for a second quarter in a row by more than 1 point compared to this time last year. \u2047 On a one and two-year basis, Goldfish delivered strong results including double-digit consumption growth, increased household penetration and higher repeat rates. \u2047 This solid performance on Goldfish was due in part to the successful launch of limited edition Goldfish Frank's RedHot crackers. \u2047 Additionally, the reinstatement of promotions improved performance on multi-packs and an effective marketing campaign contributed to our strong results. \u2047 We are excited to continue to introduce on trend limited editions on Goldfish with the launch of this week of Goldfish Jalapeno Popper and plans for additional innovation later this fiscal year. \u2047 Entering the fourth quarter amid rising inflation, labor shortages and some executional pressures, we better focused our agenda in the Snacks division, driving operational excellence and allocating additional resources throughout the supply chain network. \u2047 We are very pleased with the speed and progress we have made to address the executional pressures we experienced in the third quarter. \u2047 We head into fiscal 2022 with a stronger foundation and confidence we can continue our significant transformation on this important business. \u2047 On Slide 17, we do expect the challenging environment in fiscal 2022 as COVID persists and inflation in labor availability remain highly volatile. \u2047 However, we also anticipate our effective pricing actions, supply chain productivity programs and cost savings initiatives to be significant offsets, resulting in an improvement in the second half of the fiscal year relative to the prior year and exiting fiscal 2022 with momentum, as we continue to make progress on our strategic plan. \u2047 Mick will provide more details on our fiscal 2022 outlook and assumptions in a moment. \u2047 Turning to Slide 19 for the fourth quarter organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the additional week and the impact of the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business declined 4% as we cycled both the elevated demand in food purchases for at-home consumption, and a partial retailer inventory recovery in the prior year. \u2047 Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, which we view to be more meaningful given the COVID-19 impact to prior year, organic net sales increased 4% on a two-year CAGR. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT decreased 13% compared to prior year, to $267 million driven by lower sales volume, including the impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter and a lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and lower adjusted administrative expenses. \u2047 Our adjusted EBIT margin was 14.3% compared to 14.6% in the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.08 or 13% versus prior year to $0.55 per share, partially driven by the estimated $0.04 contribution from the additional week in fiscal 2020. \u2047 For the full-year organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the additional week, divestitures hence the impact of currency were comparable to the prior year and grew 3% compared to fiscal 2019 on a two-year CAGR basis. \u2047 Compared to prior year, Meals & Beverages organic net sales decreased 1% driven by declines in foodservice, partially offset by growth in V8 beverages. \u2047 In Snacks, organic net sales were flat, as gains in our salty snacks portfolio including Late July snacks and Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps and in Goldfish crackers were offset by declines in Lance sandwich crackers and in partner brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio. \u2047 Full-year adjusted EBIT decreased 3% versus the prior year to $1.4 billion. \u2047 The decline reflected lower adjusted gross margin and lower sales volume, including the impact of prior year's additional week, partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and higher adjusted other income. \u2047 Our marketing and selling expenses represented 9.6% of net sales compared to 10.9% last year. \u2047 Full year 2021 adjusted EBIT margin was 16.6% compared to 16.7% in the prior year. \u2047 Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operation increased 1% to $2.98 per share. \u2047 On the next slide, I'll break down our net sales performance for the fourth quarter. \u2047 Organic net sales decreased 4% during the quarter lapping an increase of 12% in the prior year quarter when the demand for at-home consumption remained elevated and retailers partially recovered on the inventory. \u2047 The organic net sales decline was driven by a 5 points headwind due to volume declines, partially offset by favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending, which each drove a 1 point gain in the quarter. \u2047 The impact of one last week in the quarter subtracted 7 points and the recent sale of Plum subtracted 1 point. \u2047 All in, our reported net sales declined to 11% from the prior year stronger than anticipated as in-market demand remained elevated. \u2047 Turning to Slide 22, our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin decreased by 420 basis points from 35.6% last year to 31.4% this year, which was generally consistent with our expectations. \u2047 Mix and operating leverage had a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points and 40 basis points respectively on gross margin, as we continue to transition from last year's elevated demand. \u2047 Net pricing drove a 100 basis point improvement due to lower levels of promotional spending in the quarter as well as favorable price and sales allowances, which do not yet reflect the price increases effective first quarter of fiscal 2022. \u2047 Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 640 basis points with slightly more than half of the"], "gold_summary": ["program has no expiration date and is in addition to the $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program.  \u2047
