be found on our Investor Relations website. \u2047 We got off to a solid start to the year with every business making an important contribution to the quarter. \u2047 Overall, revenue at constant currency grew 14% and every business improved their EBIT performance. \u2047 For the second consecutive quarter, SendTech improved EBIT on a year-to-year basis. \u2047 As I mentioned before, the transformation of SendTech from a business in secular decline to a business well positioned to capture new value in the shipping market is one of the most impressive transformation I've ever seen. \u2047 The business has leveraged digital technologies to transform our offerings and our go-to-market strategy. \u2047 SendTech's platform is built on IoT technologies that are delivered on a fast chassis and this business is very well positioned going forward. \u2047 Our Presort business continued with the momentum we saw at the end of last year with both revenue and EBIT improving on a year-to-year basis. \u2047 Global Ecommerce revenue at constant currency grew 40% for the quarter and EBIT margins improved nearly 400 basis points on a year-to-year basis. \u2047 Importantly, profit performance improved throughout the quarter as our labor model continued to mature and pricing changes kicked in. \u2047 In the month of March, Domestic Parcel Services per unit labor cost delivered the best performance compared to any quarter since second quarter of last year. \u2047 We expect unit labor cost to continue to improve and transportation and automation efficiencies are primarily still in front of us. \u2047 Transportation cost remain high in both our Ecommerce and Presort businesses. \u2047 So further insourcing our transportation, as well as the deployment of automation will benefit both businesses. \u2047 A lot of opportunity in front of us as we continue to invest in areas that will yield future productivity benefits. \u2047 We also made several important additions to our Global Ecommerce team. \u2047 While I'm sure the team will continue to evolve, we have a group of professionals and consultants guiding our business who have built business to consumer networks centered on induction to the USPS system. \u2047 Cash performance for the quarter was also relatively strong compared to prior year off of an improved working capital performance. \u2047 The team continue to demonstrate strong operational discipline. \u2047 We also executed a successful refinance in the quarter. \u2047 There are two objectives to the refinancing. \u2047 First, we wanted to push out the maturities, further decreasing our refinancing risk. \u2047 Secondly, and more important in my perspective, we created strategic flexibility. \u2047 We achieved both those objectives. \u2047 I've described four chapters of transformations, quick wins, sustained investment, revenue growth and finally, profitable revenue growth. \u2047 Last quarter, I said we are poised to enter that fourth chapter, profitable revenue growth. \u2047 It's hard to call the first quarter an inflection point given the nominal EBIT increase but revenue and profit did increase and are very much like our position going forward. \u2047 Each business is poised to continue to make progress during this year and for that matter, going forward beyond this year. \u2047 All in all, I'm quite pleased with the quarter. \u2047 It turned in another strong revenue performance and improved EBIT across each segment compared to the prior year. \u2047 As the revenue compares get more difficult as the year goes on, growth will inevitably moderate but the trend is quite clear and are very much like the way we are positioned. \u2047 Before I get into the details of the quarter, this being my first earnings call with the team, I want to share with you a few thoughts on what attracted me to Pitney Bowes. \u2047 The first thing that attracted was the growth trajectory. \u2047 Now that I have had a chance to go deeper into the business, I am confident that we are on the right path of achieving what Marc referred to as the fourth chapter of our transformation, which is profitable revenue growth. \u2047 The second item is culture. \u2047 I can feel a true sense of team, pride and passion for continuously innovating and winning in the marketplace. \u2047 These are concepts that you cannot necessarily teach, they are ingrained and I consider them to be imperative to our success. \u2047 And last, what I did not realize or quickly learned is how much technology is deeply needed in everything we do. \u2047 It's not as evident when you look at the business from a distance, but I believe it's one of the major enablers to the company's transformation. \u2047 Now, let me turn to our first quarter results. \u2047 Revenue was $915 million and grew 14% over prior year. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $0.07 and GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.18. \u2047 GAAP earnings per share includes a $0.22 loss on the refinancing of our debt as well as a $0.02 loss from discontinued operations and $0.01 on restructuring charges. \u2047 Free cash flow was a net use of $1 million and cash from operations was $66 million, both an improvement from prior year due to favorable working capital changes largely around the timing of accounts payable and accounts receivable along with improved collections. \u2047 This was partially offset by lower customer deposits at our PB Bank. \u2047 During the quarter, we paid $9 million in dividends and made $4 million in restructuring payments. \u2047 We invested $43 million in capex as part of our plan to drive future operational efficiencies. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $697 million in cash and short-term investments. \u2047 Total debt was $2.4 billion. \u2047 We took several actions during the quarter to refine our capital structure along with reducing overall debt by $126 million from prior year. \u2047 These actions further reduce refinancing risk with the reduction of our near-term bond maturities. \u2047 We also improved the pricing up and substantially paid out our term loan B, improved our covenants which provides us greater strategic flexibility and extended the duration across our capital structure. \u2047 When you take our finance receivables and cash into account with our debt, our implied operating debt is $690 million. \u2047 Looking at the P&L, starting with revenue versus prior year. \u2047 Business services grew 28%, equipment sales grew 12% and rentals were flat to prior year. \u2047 We had declines in Support Services of 4%, supplies of 10% and financing revenues of 14%. \u2047 Gross profit was $299 million and gross margin was 33%, which was down from the same period last year largely due to the mix and shift of the portfolio, but is an improvement from the fourth quarter. \u2047 SG&A was $238 million or 26% of revenue. \u2047 This is an improvement of $10 million and 5 points respectively from prior year. \u2047 Within SG&A, corporate expenses were $57 million which was up about $14 million over prior year largely due to benefits recognized last year around employee variable-related costs and a sales tax credit. \u2047 R&D was $11 million or 1% of revenue and down slightly from prior year. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT dollars were $50 million, which was a slight improvement over prior year. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT margin was 5%. \u2047 Interest expense, including finance interest was $37 million. \u2047 Our tax provision on adjusted earnings was a benefit of about $400,000 and includes a benefit associated with an affiliate reorganization. \u2047 Compared to prior year, our tax provision benefited earnings per share by about 1.5%. \u2047 For purposes of determining adjusted EPS, shares outstanding are approximately $179 million. \u2047 Let me now turn to each segment's performance starting with Ecommerce. \u2047 Revenue for the segment was $413 million and grew 40% over prior year. \u2047 Revenue continues to benefit from the strong demand along with the pre-pandemic comparison. \u2047 Volumes grew year-over-year across all lines of service. \u2047 Domestic Parcel Services volumes grew 23%, Cross Border volumes were more than doubled and our Digital Services volumes grew 36%. \u2047 EBIT was a loss of $26 million and EBITDA was a loss of $8 million. \u2047 Compared to prior year, EBIT improved $3 million and EBIT margin improved nearly 400 basis points. \u2047 We made progress through the quarter where earlier on we were still dealing with the receivable of peak holiday season. \u2047 We continue to work to improve service levels in our Domestic Parcels Network balancing cost and quality which are all headed in a positive direction. \u2047 As with the industry, we all continue to see relatively high transportation costs and a competitive labor market. \u2047 However, as we move through the quarter, our Domestic Parcel Network improved parcel process per hour by approximately 45% as our labor model continued to mature. \u2047 Margins continue to be healthy in our Digital and Cross Border services. \u2047 Of the $26 million EBIT loss in the quarter, we saw a loss of $4 million in March and reported positive EBITDA for the month. \u2047 Within our Domestic Parcel Service, our initiatives to improve productivity are still largely in front of us. \u2047 As we have discussed in the past, investments will include new automated sorters along with streamlining our processes to improve productivity. \u2047 We placed one new sorter in a high volume site in the first quarter and expect to roll out more over the next 12 to 24 months. \u2047 In addition, we are implementing modern sortation processes in each of our facilities before the upcoming holiday peak season this year. \u2047 This investment and related productivity actions are expected to more than double our[Indecipherable] process per hour our over time. \u2047 In addition, our transportation team continues to execute on the strategy of migrating outsourced lane into our own PBC. \u2047 In the first quarter, we insourced several of these lanes with more plans for the second quarter, all which will improve cost and service. \u2047 We also brought in third-party industry expertise to help support our execution in the area of transportation. \u2047 We believe that optimizing our transportation will yield significant productivity benefits. \u2047 Finally, we are in the process of opening two new sites and upgrading another which we expect to have completed prior to the peak season. \u2047 This will allow us to handle volumes more efficiently and deliver deeper into the USPS network. \u2047 Ultimately, we expect transportation and labor productivity along with optimizing final mile solutions to be critical drivers in obtaining our long-term e-commerce margins. \u2047 We expect these to account for approximately 75% of the margin improvement. \u2047 Our Presort Services saw the momentum from the second half of 2020 continue into the first quarter. \u2047 The business turned in a solid performance growing revenue, EBIT and EBIT margin over prior year. \u2047 Revenue was $143 million and grew 2%. \u2047 Overall, average daily volumes were flat to prior year where First Class Letter Mail declined 2%, Marketing Mail grew 11% and Marketing Mail Flats and Bound Printed Matter grew 30%. \u2047 EBIT was $19 million and EBIT margin was 13%. \u2047 EBITDA was $27 million and EBITDA margin was 19%. \u2047 EBIT and EBITDA improved from prior year due to both revenue growth and lower expenses. \u2047 We have been able to maintain double-digit margin in the Presort Business even as we continue to invest in our talent and equipment. \u2047 Compared to prior year, we improved pieces fed per labor hour by 4% resulting in 85,000 less processing hours. \u2047 Within SendTech, we also picked up on the momentum from the second half of 2020 as we continue to soften the decline in our revenue and maintain strong EBIT margins. \u2047 Revenue was $359 million and declined 3%. \u2047 We continue to differentiate ourselves in the market with our end-to-end mailing and shipping offerings to enterprise and small office providers that are attractive to both existing and new clients. \u2047 We have a growing revenue stream around office shipping that carries with it high margins approaching that of our legacy mailing business and a software business. \u2047 And like the legacy mailing business, the shipping opportunity in SendTech provides multiple paths for us to add profit and revenue like supply, financing and professional services. \u2047 SendTech's shipping related revenues grew at a low double-digit rate to approximately $30 million in the quarter. \u2047 The number of labels printed through our shipping offerings grew over 40% and paid subscriptions grew approximately 80%. \u2047 Additionally, we are seeing good growth in shipping volumes that our US clients are financing which grew nearly 80% over prior year. \u2047 These positive metrics show that our clients are adopting and using these new offerings as they see the value it brings to their business. \u2047 Equipment sales grew 12% over prior year driven by strong placement of our SendPro C, which include a large government deal and we continue to see good placements of our new central mail station, multipurpose device. \u2047 It is important to point out that like others, we have experienced transportation issues related to our supply chain. \u2047 We have been able to properly manage our inventory and grow our equipment sales despite these challenges and it is an area that we are closely monitoring. \u2047 We are also keeping a close eye on the semiconductor industry and are looking to mitigate any potential second half supply shortage by repositioning our solutions as necessary. \u2047 We turned in a strong EBIT performance of a $114 million which represents growth of $8 million over prior year and is the second consecutive quarter of EBIT growth. \u2047 EBIT margin was 32%, which improved 250 basis points over prior year. \u2047 EBITDA was $122 million, EBITDA margin was 34%, both improving over prior year. \u2047 As you may recall, prior year included an increase to our credit-loss provision to reflect macroeconomic conditions resulting from COVID-19 in connection with the application of the CECL accounting standards. \u2047 One other point that I would like to make is that this team has done a tremendous amount of work, not only to transform its products and offerings, but also its channel. \u2047 Today, about 80% of all US sales transactions are happening through our web or inside sales channel. \u2047 This has allowed our field team to concentrate on larger enterprise deals and this has been a great contributor to maintaining the very healthy margins that we see in this business. \u2047 I am pleased with the performance of our key trend in the first quarter. \u2047 We entered the year with good momentum and continued to concentrate on the opportunities in front of us, and we expect to make good progress throughout the year. \u2047 As discussed during our last earnings call, we continue to expect annual revenue at constant currency to grow over prior year in the low to mid-single digit range making this our fifth consecutive year of constant currency revenue growth. \u2047 We also continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to grow over prior year. \u2047 Free cash flow is expected to be lower from prior year primarily due to specific items which benefited 2020 such as higher customer deposits, lower finance receivable and lower capex, which are not expected to continue at the same level in 2021. \u2047 Within our segments, we"], "gold_summary": ["q1 adjusted earnings per share $0.07.  \u2047  q1 gaap
