{"article": ["I am Monica Vinay, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer at Myers Industries. \u2047 If you have not yet received cast on our website and will be archived along with the transcript of the call shortly after this event. \u2047 These comments are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \u2047 Such statements

am pleased to share that we had another quarter of strong sales growth and continue to make good progress in advancing our long-term vision. \u2047 The second quarter was defined by continued recovery across our key end markets and strong operational execution in a challenging environment. \u2047 On top of that, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Trilogy Plastics, which marks our second acquisition in the last nine months and another proof point in the execution of Horizon one of our long-term strategy. \u2047 The acquisition of Trilogy continue to grow our rotational molding platform, and we have included a slide in the appendix of our slide deck today with more background for you. \u2047 I will review Trilogy and provide some additional updates on our strategy in my closing remarks. \u2047 Continued strong demand across our Material Handling and Distribution segments drove a 58% year-over-year growth in sales, and we delivered a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 20% on an organic basis, with all end markets supplying solid growth. \u2047 Demand from our customers is strong and looks to continue. \u2047 We have the leading market share of high-quality, well-regarded products, and we have seen that the demand for these products is durable and lasting, even in a pandemic. \u2047 I am pleased with our niche market focus and approach. \u2047 It provides us a solid foundation on which to build and grow Myers. \u2047 Despite our exciting long-term vision, however, we have had some short-term headwinds, increasing raw material prices and other inflationary pressures continued throughout this quarter. \u2047 And in some cases, were more than we anticipated. \u2047 While we expect them to be temporary in nature, the short-term raw material issues around supply and cost escalations have been unprecedented. \u2047 We have taken swift action, announcing and implementing price increases in March and April and again in July. \u2047 Unfortunately, our finished good prices were not able to keep up with the pace of cost increases, and we experienced margin compression during the quarter. \u2047 As we have said before, we are committed to restoring and expanding our margins across the enterprise. \u2047 This is one of the key objectives of the self-help component of Horizon 1. \u2047 Like many companies, we are also seeing tightness in the labor market. \u2047 And while we are working to mitigate the impact, labor cost increases and scarcity have been a headwind in 2021 that will likely persist in the near-term. \u2047 Over the coming months, we remain diligent in monitoring and adjusting our actions to mitigate the impact of inflation. \u2047 We are working to ensure we strike a fair, long-term mindset with our customers, doing our best to ensure they have supply, while ensuring our products are priced appropriately for the value they provide. \u2047 Our self-help efforts are delivering results, and were headed in the right direction strategically and operationally. \u2047 We are transforming Myers and are successfully executing against our long-term vision and strategy. \u2047 Let us begin with a review of our second quarter financial results on slide four. \u2047 Net sales were up $69 million, an increase of 58%. \u2047 Excluding the impact of the Elkhart acquisition, organic net sales increased 26% due primarily to higher volume mix. \u2047 Favorable price contributed 5% and FX 1%. \u2047 Sales increased in both our Material Handling and Distribution segments in all key end markets. \u2047 Adjusted gross profit was up $12.5 million, while gross margin decreased from 36% in the prior year to 29.4% in the quarter. \u2047 Margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs, primarily resin, which continued to increase sequentially during the quarter. \u2047 These costs were not fully offset by higher prices, which led to an unfavorable price to cost relationship. \u2047 Adjusted operating income increased $2.80 million to $15.1 million. \u2047 The increase in gross profit was mostly offset by higher SG&A expenses, driven by the addition of Elkhart, higher salaries and incentive compensation costs and higher legal fees. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $20.5 million, an increase of $2.4 million compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9%. \u2047 And lastly, adjusted earnings per share was $0.29, an increase of $0.06 or 26% compared to the prior year. \u2047 Turning now to slide five for an overview of segment performance. \u2047 Beginning with material handling, net sales increased $56 million or 70%, including the Elkhart acquisition. \u2047 On an organic basis, material handling net sales increased 24% due to strong volume mix. \u2047 We gained an additional 6% due to favorable price and 2% in FX. \u2047 Material handling adjusted operating income increased approximately 8% to $17 million, driven by higher volume mix and the addition of Elkhart, which were partially offset by an unfavorable price to cost relationship due to escalating raw material costs and higher SG&A expenses. \u2047 The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to the addition of Elkhart, higher salaries and incentive compensation costs, increased travel cost and legal fees. \u2047 In the Distribution segment, sales increased $12.6 million or 34%, driven by both equipment and consumable sales. \u2047 Distribution's adjusted operating income more than doubled from the prior year to $4.2 million. \u2047 The growth was driven by higher volume mix that was partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs. \u2047 Turning to slide six. \u2047 Free cash flow was $11.7 million in the quarter, an increase of $8.1 million over the prior year, driven by higher cash from comps. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $13.1 million. \u2047 Cash on hand at quarter end was $13.5 million. \u2047 Our balance sheet remains strong. \u2047 At the end of the second quarter, leverage was one times. \u2047 Our capital structure continues to provide the flexibility needed to execute our growth strategy. \u2047 And on July 30, we utilized our revolving credit facility to finance the Trilogy acquisition. \u2047 Turning to slide seven. \u2047 Before providing an update on guidance, let me take a moment to discuss the ongoing macroeconomic environment. \u2047 As Mike mentioned, and similar to many other industrial manufacturers, we are facing what we believe are temporary disruptions in the supply chain, which have led to unprecedented increases in raw material costs this year. \u2047 We have continued to take pricing actions to mitigate these significant increases. \u2047 But due to a lag in price realization, we have not been able to keep up with the pace of cost increases. \u2047 As a result, we expect to remain in an unfavorable price to cost position for the third quarter. \u2047 We believe many factors, including additional supplier capacity should result in resin costs moderating and potentially easing as we continue through the year. \u2047 As such, we expect our price to cost relationship to turn favorable in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Let me now provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2021, which includes expected results of the Trilogy acquisition completed on July 30. \u2047 Reported net sales are anticipated to increase in the mid-40% range. \u2047 Our previous sales guidance was in the high 30% range. \u2047 Note that a little more than half of the expected increase over the prior year is due to the impact of both the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisitions. \u2047 Elkhart's annual net sales at the time of acquisition were approximately $100 million. \u2047 And Trilogy's annual net sales are roughly $35 million. \u2047 We are reaffirming our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. \u2047 Our guidance reflects a weighted average share count of 36.5 million shares. \u2047 And also note that Trilogy is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings per share in the current fiscal year. \u2047 Other key modeling assumptions include depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $23 million and capex of approximately $15 million to $18 million. \u2047 capex is expected to trend higher than past years with our renewed focus on investing in our facilities and improving our capacity, along with the addition of Elkhart and Trilogy. \u2047 Interest expense is forecasted to be between four and $4.5 million, and the effective tax rate is forecasted to be 26%. \u2047 In closing, while the short-term is being pressured by significant inflationary headwinds, our long-term fundamentals are intact. \u2047 We continue to manage cost increases through pricing actions, while balancing the potential impact on volume. \u2047 Our teams are working extremely hard in this dynamic environment, and we appreciate all of their efforts. \u2047 I introduced our long-term road map in October of last year. \u2047 In a short period of time, we have made meaningful progress against the current phase of this road map Horizon one and our transformation of Myers is well underway. \u2047 We have a shareholder focused, value-creating vision for our company. \u2047 I believe we have the right team in place with the right strategic plan and the right focus on execution to make it a reality. \u2047 We are off to a strong start, and we continue to execute against our goal of transforming our Material Handling segment into a high-growth business that's a true innovator of engineered plastic solutions, while we also continue to grow and optimize our Distribution segment. \u2047 Horizon one of our strategy is rooted in the execution of three areas: number one, self-help initiatives, which includes improvements in purchasing, value-based pricing and SG&A optimization. \u2047 number two, organic growth fueled by sales and commercial excellence, and one important component of which is to build out our e-commerce channel. \u2047 And number three, bolt-on M&A to build out our existing businesses. \u2047 Continued execution across these three elements will propel us into Horizon two, where we plan to use our cash flow and knowledge gained from Horizon one to pursue enterprise level M&A in North America. \u2047 The focus on Horizon three will be to pursue enterprise level M&A on a global scale. \u2047 This vision and roadmap is supported by our four strategic pillars outlined in slide nine. \u2047 Because I have described each pillar in detail on previous calls, I will move to slide 10 and give an update on the recent progress we have made with respect to each. \u2047 On the organic growth front, we continue to make headway in implementing our improved commercial structure that standardizes and strengthens our focus in sales, marketing and product management. \u2047 We are installing a world-class commercial organization at Myers. \u2047 And while this will take some time, we are moving the needle with new additions and new training. \u2047 Examples of our areas of focus include improving our capability and processes and account planning and account management and demand planning and in optimizing how we run our supply chain and planning processes. \u2047 Additionally, through critical investments in talent and infrastructure, including the summit we held last quarter, we have fortified a stand-alone e-commerce organization, and we are seeing good traction with that group. \u2047 On Pillar two, as it relates to M&A, we are very pleased to have closed our second bolt-on acquisition to supplement our plastics business. \u2047 Trilogy Plastics is well aligned with our strategic objectives and culture and has an exemplary track record of providing high-quality products to its customers with superior service and on-time delivery. \u2047 We are targeting approximately $1 million of annual cost synergies, which we expect to realize by the end of 2022. \u2047 Most of this will be through supply chain cost reductions. \u2047 This is on top of the $4 million to $6 million of cost synergies we expect from Elkhart. \u2047 In addition to these cost synergies, we are seeing growth opportunities and synergies with Elkhart, and we expect the same from Trilogy. \u2047 As expected, and as part of our Horizon one approach, as we pursue more acquisitions our organization is learning. \u2047 We are fine-tuning our playbook and our capabilities to identify and complete deals as well as to integrate and obtain synergies. \u2047 This plan and approach are working. \u2047 We are gaining capability and speed as we move forward. \u2047 Trilogy was an important step in our journey, and we continue to seek opportunities to acquire complementary businesses, and we currently have numerous actionable targets in our pipeline. \u2047 Moving on to operational excellence. \u2047 This pillar has been integral to our growth over recent quarters. \u2047 In the midst of global supply chain issues, our newly centralized procurement team has done a good job sourcing the necessary raw materials to meet most of our customers' needs. \u2047 The last several months have been a challenge on raw material cost and availability. \u2047 Jeff Baker and his team in procurement and supply chain have done a nice job on both issues. \u2047 Over the past months, we positioned Myers as a value-added solutions provider. \u2047 We have made thoughtful decisions on price and supply to ensure we create long-term goodwill and value for our customers as well as all of our stakeholders. \u2047 As you may have seen, Myers recently unveiled its new brand identity logo website. \u2047 We consider this new visual identity to be much more than aesthetic change, but rather strategic choice to reflect our One Myers vision and reinforce our key values of integrity, optimism, customer focus and a can-do attitude. \u2047 We are changing signs, business cards, the website, name badges, all to a single one team mindset. \u2047 We are no longer a collection of smaller brands, we are coming together as one company. \u2047 We have more critical mass, more capability to serve our customers and our employees. \u2047 With that, I will turn to our fourth pillar, which is our high-performance culture. \u2047 In order to execute and achieve breakthrough performance, we need to have a high performing culture. \u2047 To that end, we recently launched our new Learning Management System, which is comprised of live and online classes to help drive growth, improvement and continuity in our employee base. \u2047 We see that this -- we see that LMS will help us win the war on talent. \u2047 Our employees see that we are investing in them, in their careers and in their development. \u2047 We want our employees to grow here at Myers. \u2047 We are creating a culture of employee success within the company. \u2047 This includes the type of training and employee development programs in career and succession planning typically found at larger world class companies. \u2047 We"], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.29.  \u2047  myers industries -sees 2021 net sales growth in mid 40% range, with about
