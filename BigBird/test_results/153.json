{"article": ["As some of you know, our Head of Investor Relations, Rubun Dey, recently left the company to pursue other opportunities. \u2047 Our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Laura Adams, has stepped in as Interim Head of Investor Relations, which she will oversee while also maintaining her ongoing role. \u2047 Laura has been a finance executive with the firm for over a decade, overseeing many areas of corporate finance, including governance, financial and treasury oversight and risk mitigation. \u2047 She has played a vital role for me and our leadership team in our strategic decision-making around our capital allocation and M&A plans and our investment thesis more recently. \u2047 During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. \u2047 We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter fiscal year 2022 slides. \u2047 We are now on Slide 4. \u2047 Laura, it's great to have you play a more public role on these calls, because you have been a leader on our finance team and integral to the quarterly earnings process for many years. \u2047 I have personally relied on your expertise for as long as I've been CEO. \u2047 Lloyd and I, along with several of our Booz Allen colleagues were excited to be in New York City earlier this month to share our new investment thesis and our strategy for growth. \u2047 It was great to see so many of you in person, and we hope you took away from that event a deeper understanding of our strategy, business and multi-year financial goals. \u2047 Today, we will continue the conversation in the context of our second quarter results for the fiscal year. \u2047 And we will show how Booz Allen is already setting up to accelerate into the financial goals described in our investment thesis. \u2047 I'm also pleased to share an update on our future of work rollout. \u2047 Before diving into the second quarter results, I want to briefly recap a few points from our Investor Day, starting with VLT; velocity, leadership and technology. \u2047 VLT is the strategic framework that will accelerate our growth and create exceptional shareholder value. \u2047 Through VLT, we will capitalize on future market opportunities and leverage our positioning to deploy talent and capital against the nation's highest priorities. \u2047 As part of our new strategy, we also told you about the opportunities we see for hyper growth in the areas of digital battle space and national cyber, among others. \u2047 And then those of you who attended AUSA a week later, saw some of our differentiated technology solutions that are transforming national missions. \u2047 Specifically, demos of Rainmaker and a few of our Edge solutions are excellent examples of how we are leading in our market. \u2047 Fueled by the investments we have made during Vision 2020, Booz Allen holds first-mover advantage at key intersections of technology and mission. \u2047 The overall strategy is important because it's what creates our strong financial performance year-to-year. \u2047 And on Investor Day, we were pleased to present our new investment thesis. \u2047 It's the multi-year outlook that will frame our quarter-to-quarter performance going forward. \u2047 At the core of these thesis is accelerating growth in adjusted EBITDA dollars through fiscal year 2025. \u2047 We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase by about 50% from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. \u2047 Broadly, we expect this increase to be driven by above market organic revenue growth, continued strong margins and capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. \u2047 To be more specific, our path to 50% adjusted EBITDA growth includes financial expectations of 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment during the period. \u2047 The leadership team and I are confident that we can accelerate growth and achieve the goals in our investment thesis. \u2047 We have the right strategy. \u2047 And more importantly, the right team is in place to drive our business. \u2047 This quarter's results demonstrate that Booz Allen is already positioned for acceleration. \u2047 So let me shift now to an overview of the second quarter. \u2047 As we have said since fiscal year 2022 begun, this year's growth pattern looks different from recent fiscal years with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration expected in the second half. \u2047 These pattern is primarily due to three factors. \u2047 First and most important, a ramp-up in hiring. \u2047 Second, productivity and time of dynamics tied to the pandemic that create challenging comps in the first half. \u2047 And third, full inclusion of revenue from acquisitions. \u2047 These factors contribute to choppiness at the top-line. \u2047 And with our second quarter results now final, you can see that the first half of the fiscal year played out just as we expected. \u2047 For the full six months, revenue growth was in the low-single-digits. \u2047 We are pleased to report that across bottom line metrics we outperformed in the first half with strong profit margins driving EBITDA and ADEPS growth. \u2047 Book-to-bill for the second quarter was strong, reflecting a significant year-over-year increase in bookings and cash generation was exceptional. \u2047 Our latest results demonstrate several key things about our business at the midpoint of the fiscal year. \u2047 We are not demand constraint, as shown in our backlog and book-to-bill performance. \u2047 Hiring, which is our top operational priority, rapidly accelerated over the first two quarters. \u2047 We continue to attract and retain the talent we need in a very competitive market, and we aim to keep our momentum going. \u2047 Our team is managing the business extraordinarily well, which can be seen especially in the bottom line metrics. \u2047 We are well underway with making strategic acquisitions and successfully integrating them, with our acquisition of Tracepoint last month being the most recent example. \u2047 We're already seeing lift from combining Tracepoint's channel access and incident response expertise with Booz Allen's cyber consulting and managed services offerings. \u2047 And while we did face headwinds from comps and a slow ramp up on some contracts, we continue to manage through them. \u2047 Taken together, our first half results and the strong operational performance behind them point to acceleration through the rest of the fiscal year. \u2047 To achieve our second half objectives, we are focused on a set of priorities that are critical to our success. \u2047 Let me walk through them. \u2047 Our top priority remains recruiting. \u2047 We must continue strong hiring to execute our growing backlog. \u2047 Second, we will maintain operational excellence in managing the business. \u2047 Third, we will continue to capture key market opportunities. \u2047 Fourth, we will capitalize on the upside presented by our acquisitions of Liberty and Tracepoint. \u2047 And fifth, we will continue to invest in our people and differentiated solutions to drive growth beyond this fiscal year. \u2047 Lloyd and I are confident Booz Allen will continue to make progress on these objectives. \u2047 And today, we are pleased to reaffirm guidance for the full fiscal year. \u2047 We believe that our growing momentum will both deliver another successful year and accelerate our business into the years covered by our new investment thesis. \u2047 Lloyd will share more details on our results and fiscal year 2022 guidance in a few minutes. \u2047 Before giving him the floor, I want to provide an update on the implementation of our future of work program. \u2047 As you may recall, we believe we can offer our people increased flexibility in the way we work with the expectation that many of our people will work in a hybrid model. \u2047 It makes up telework and purposeful in-person collaboration. \u2047 We have plans to launch future of work and reopen all our offices on September 7, but those plans have to be delayed. \u2047 It just was not safe at the time given the summer wave of COVID driven by the Delta variant. \u2047 Since then, case metrics have improved and we are implementing a vaccination policy consistent with the federal government's mandate, requirements and timeline. \u2047 We're making excellent progress in our vaccination rates. \u2047 And earlier this month, we began a phase reopening of offices that have remained closed, and we expect to have all offices open by November 22. \u2047 We are excited to now be in the position to safely engage more broadly with clients and colleagues in-person. \u2047 Our people did an extraordinary job staying connected over the past 19 months. \u2047 But just like Investor Day, there are times when being face-to-face is best. \u2047 Our future of work program provides the flexibility to come together with purpose when and where it makes the most sense. \u2047 With the opportunity to see more of our teams, clients, investors and other Booz Allen stakeholders in-person, I'm feeling energized and confident about the future. \u2047 And my optimism is enhanced by the strong performance we delivered in the first half and how it sets us up for acceleration for the rest of the fiscal year and well beyond. \u2047 And with that, Lloyd, over to you to take us through the financials in depth. \u2047 Our overall objective with Investor Day was to once again demonstrate Booz Allen's commitment to long-term profitable growth. \u2047 Leveraging our VLT strategy, we will make the internal investments and strategic acquisitions required to drive and execute that growth. \u2047 In our view, the first half of fiscal year 2022 was an inflection point. \u2047 As we move into the second half of the fiscal year and move past the direct and indirect influences of COVID over the last 19 months, we are entering the next leg of the firm's multi-year journey. \u2047 As Horacio noted, we closed out the first half of the fiscal year with top-line performance in line with our expectations and prior guidance and with bottom-line performance well ahead. \u2047 This gives us great confidence in our plan for the full fiscal year. \u2047 Our large backlog, strong bookings and proposal activity signals continued client interest and strong demand for our work. \u2047 Our hiring engine is now firing on all cylinders, positioning us to drive growth in the second half of the fiscal year. \u2047 We closed on the acquisitions of Liberty and Tracepoint. \u2047 As we have noted, we anticipated early year choppiness in our top-line results as we move into a post-COVID operating rhythm, which played out as we expected. \u2047 Our strong balance sheet position and favorable market conditions have allowed us to take advantage of a number of opportunities, including attractive levels of debt financing, M&A and share repurchases. \u2047 As a reminder, we had forecast constrained low-single-digit top-line growth in the first half with an acceleration through the fiscal year, driven by three dynamics: a ramp up in contracts and hiring, normalizing staff utilization and time off usage, growing contributions from acquisitions. \u2047 I will speak to these in more detail when I address our guidance. \u2047 With that, let me walk you through the second quarter results. \u2047 At the top-line, in the second quarter, revenue increased 4.3% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. \u2047 Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 3.6% to $1.5 billion. \u2047 Revenue growth was driven by inorganic contributions and solid operational performance, offset from higher than normal staff utilization in the comparable prior year period. \u2047 Now, let me step through performance at the market level. \u2047 In defense, revenue declined by 0.6%, primarily due to a significant materials purchased in billable expenses and unusually high staff utilization in the prior year period, a headwind felt throughout most of our markets. \u2047 Defense also saw some slowness in ramp ups on both new and existing work, while ongoing protests continue to create uncertainty on the timing of programs starts. \u2047 In the first six months, revenue increased 1.8%. \u2047 In civil, revenue grew by 16.4% led by strong performance in our health business and the addition of Liberty. \u2047 Liberty's contributions so far is slightly outpacing our previously forecasted range of $300 million to $340 million of annualized revenue. \u2047 We remain exceptionally pleased with Liberty's performance and contribution to Booz Allen and are well underway with plans to fully integrate it with our broader health and digital business. \u2047 We are feeling momentum across this entire market as we continue to capture key opportunities aligned to the government's priorities. \u2047 In the first six months, revenue increased 11.2%. \u2047 In intelligence, we recorded 0.8% revenue growth this quarter. \u2047 Our portfolio reshaping efforts have started to yield critical wins, and we are excited to see this business return to growth. \u2047 For the full first six months, revenue declined 2.9%, but we believe this will continue to turnaround in the second half of the fiscal year. \u2047 Lastly, revenue and global commercial declined 5.7% compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 We continued to strategically shift focus to our U.S. commercial cyber business and anticipate growth in the back half of the fiscal year as we accelerate hiring to capitalize on the strong demand and additive growth in the business from Tracepoint. \u2047 In the first six months, revenue declined 17.2%. \u2047 Our book-to-bill for the quarter was 2.03 times, while our last 12 month's book-to-bill was 1.28 times. \u2047 Total backlog grew 18% year-over-year, resulting in backlog of $29 billion, a new record. \u2047 Funded backlog grew 9.7% to $4.9 billion, unfunded backlog grew 54.7% to $9.5 billion and priced options grew 4.4% to $14.6 billion. \u2047 We are proud of our bookings performance in the second quarter, which continues to demonstrate we are not demand constrained, and our ability to win and convert on work aligned with our core capabilities and clients' most critical missions. \u2047 Pivoting to headcount, as of September 30, we had approximately 29,200 employees, up by about 1,600 year-over-year or 5.8%. \u2047 In the first half of the fiscal year, we added approximately 1,500 employees. \u2047 As we have previously noted, the competition for talent, particularly technical talent, remains fierce. \u2047 Still, we have successfully executed our hiring and retention strategies. \u2047 As Betty Thompson highlighted at Investor Day, those strategies focused on fostering a strong people-centered culture and effective talent systems that support individual pursuits as well as business needs. \u2047 Accelerating headcount growth remains a top operational priority for this fiscal year and will be key as we move into the next multi-year period of our investment thesis. \u2047 We expect to continue building on our progress through the second half of the fiscal year. \u2047 Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $270 million, up 18.1% from the prior year period. \u2047
