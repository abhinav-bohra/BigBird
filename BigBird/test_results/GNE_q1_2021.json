{"article": ["Today, we will discuss our operational and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021. \u2047 Avi Goldin, our Chief Financial Officer will follow with a deeper dive into the quarter's financial results. \u2047 As we discussed when we reported last quarter's earnings, the first quarter was impacted by unusually severe weather events that led to massive spikes in wholesale electricity prices in Texas and Japan. \u2047 The severe winter storms in Texas and Japan had an aggregate negative impact on income from operations of approximately $15.5 million. \u2047 In Texas, where the impact of the storm this quarter was approximately $13 million, our industry has borne a disproportionate share of the financial burden. \u2047 We remain hopeful that perspective legislation and regulatory changes and/or litigation will provide material relief. \u2047 Because of our ongoing commitment to financial strength and liquidity, while avoiding debt, our balance sheet remains in good shape. \u2047 Moreover, we have set ourselves the goal of finishing the year with a stronger balance sheet than we had at the start, despite the impact of the first quarter's weather events. \u2047 Our underlying business remain very strong. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, we achieved a record first quarter revenue and added to our meter and RCE counts, even though the first quarter is a historically slow quarter for customer acquisition. \u2047 RCEs increased by 10,000 to 450,000 and meters increased by 7,000 to 572,000. \u2047 At Genie Retail, absent the Texas storms impact, our domestic business would likely have achieved record adjusted EBITDA despite the challenges of the pandemic environment. \u2047 GRE's revenue reached a new high as consumption per meter again increased significantly compared to the year-ago quarter and churn remained subdued. \u2047 At GRE International, we ramped up our investment to expand our customer base in Sweden and dealt with wholesale price spikes, most notably in Japan, but to a lesser extent in Scandinavia. \u2047 But to put that in perspective, across all of our international markets, our businesses are maturing. \u2047 Adjusted for the storms impact in Japan and gross margins increasing, and we expect that the growth capital requirements for these businesses will decline significantly during the year. \u2047 With that in mind, we are continuing our strategic review of our International business, carefully balancing the advantages of near-term cash generation with the need for capital to optimize long-term growth. \u2047 We expect to have more to say on that in the coming quarters. \u2047 Turning now to our former Genie Energy Services segment, we have renamed it Genie Renewables. \u2047 The change reflects the increasing prominence of our solar-related businesses within the segment and the rapid growth of the renewables market. \u2047 In the first quarter, even though Genie Renewables revenue decreased, gross margin improved significantly, while SG&A decreased materially. \u2047 The improvements reflect our shift in focus toward our Renewables businesses with higher margins. \u2047 Looking ahead, we are working to expand the geographic footprint for our solar solutions businesses and are evaluating opportunities to increase the vertical integration of those solutions. \u2047 This shift will enable us to capture more of the commercial solar value chain. \u2047 We believe that the segment's results will be the beginning of a continued trend of growth and profitability. \u2047 Wrapping up, I want to emphasize that had it not been for two exceptionally challenging winter storms, this would have been a terrific quarter. \u2047 Across the company, we are incredibly excited about the remainder of the year. \u2047 Our underlying business remains strong. \u2047 Our global customer base is at its all-time peak, our business is increasingly diversified and we are developing multiple promising growth opportunities with tremendous potential, while evaluating the best units in which to invest in continued growth. \u2047 Given our positive outlook, we were pleased to purchase nearly 147,000 shares in a private transaction following the quarter close. \u2047 While we have paused our dividend, we will continue to consider alternative means to return value to our stockholders. \u2047 My remarks today cover our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021. \u2047 Throughout my remarks, I compare first quarter 2021 to the results for the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Focusing on the year-over-year, rather than the sequential comparisons, removes some consideration of the seasonal factors that are characteristic of our retail energy business. \u2047 As Michael mentioned, our revenue in this quarter was the highest in our history. \u2047 Bottom line results would have been similarly strong had it not been for the losses incurred as a result of the winter storm Uri in Texas and extreme weather in Japan. \u2047 Nevertheless, our careful forward hedging and demand management programs, the diversification of our business operations and a strong balance sheet enable us to not only manage through the volatility, but to finish the quarter with sufficient capital and liquidity to finance and prioritize our growth initiatives. \u2047 Consolidated revenue increased 30% to $135 million. \u2047 Revenue at Genie Retail Energy increased 15% to $91 million. \u2047 Electricity and natural gas consumption per meter increased, boosted by the shift to work-from-home as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as colder winter weather, including the impact of winter storm Uri. \u2047 These factors more than compensated for decreased per unit average revenue on sales in both electricity and natural gas. \u2047 At Genie Retail Energy International, revenue increased to $42 million from $7 million in the year-ago quarter. \u2047 The $35 million increase predominantly reflects our purchase of the outstanding stake in our Orbit joint venture in the U.K. during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the consolidation of its results. \u2047 For comparison purposes, Orbit Energy generated $19.6 million in revenue in the year-ago quarter. \u2047 Additionally, expansion of our customer bases in Scandinavia and the U.K. also contributed meaningfully to the revenue increase. \u2047 Genie Renewables revenue was $2.5 million, a decrease from $18 million in the year-ago quarter when Prism Solar delivered the bulk of a large solar panel order. \u2047 Consolidated gross profit decreased $11.4 million to $17.5 million. \u2047 We estimate that the winter storms in Texas and Japan together impacted gross profit by approximately $15.5 million and, except for their impact, the quarter's results would have been very strong. \u2047 Consolidated SG&A increased to $24.1 million from $19.5 million. \u2047 The increase was entirely incurred at GRE International and reflects the consolidation of Orbit Energy, including Orbit's customer acquisition expense. \u2047 Consolidated loss from operations totaled $6.6 million compared to income from operations of $9.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decrease of $15.8 million. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was negative $4.5 million compared to positive $10.3 million in the year-ago quarter, a decrease of $14.9 million, primarily due to the Texas and Japan weather and the consolidation of Orbit Energy. \u2047 At GRE, income from operations decreased to $1.2 million from $13 million. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $1.5 million from $13.3 million. \u2047 Absent the impact of winter storm Uri in Texas, GRE's adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $14.5 million, a record for a domestic supply business. \u2047 The first quarter results again benefited from the increased consumption per meter we've seen since the pandemic as a result of the shift to work-from-home. \u2047 At GRE International, loss from operations was $6.7 million compared to $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter. \u2047 For comparison purposes, Orbit Energy's loss from operations in the first quarter of 2020 was $3 million. \u2047 The winter storm in Japan contributed approximately $2.5 million, a $4.1 million decrease. \u2047 The balance primarily reflected increased supply costs at Lumo. \u2047 Genie Renewables income from operations increased to $559,000 from $342,000 a year earlier. \u2047 In the year-ago quarter, our gross margin was 9% primarily generated by the Prism Solar panel deliveries. \u2047 As Michael mentioned, we are now focusing on higher margin opportunities within Genie Renewables. \u2047 The first quarter 2021 results suggest there's some early success as our gross margin increased to 45%. \u2047 Genie Energy's loss per diluted share was $0.09 compared to earnings per share of $0.20 in the year-ago quarter. \u2047 Turning now to the balance sheet. \u2047 At quarter end, cash, restricted cash and marketable equity securities totaled $41.7 million. \u2047 Working capital was $35.4 million and non-current liabilities were $3.5 million. \u2047 That concludes my discussion of our financial results. \u2047 All in all, our financial standing is in good order and our underlying business is very strong. \u2047 In the balance of 2021, we expect to accelerate cash generation, strengthen our balance sheet and invest prudently in growth opportunities. \u2047 Now, operator, back to you for Q&A. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname
