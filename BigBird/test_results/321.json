{"article": ["I would like to start the call on Slide three by paying our respects to the founder of our company, Jim Waters, who passed away on May 17. \u2047 Jim was a brilliant and spirited scientist and a pioneer in liquid chromatography. \u2047 I met Jim the first time in 2019 when he came to talk to me about the merits of a technology we had acquired in a previous company. \u2047 We spent hours in front of a whiteboard debating how to manage innovation and, in particular, how the application of certain technology could deliver benefit. \u2047 Jim continued reaching out to me, not just on technology, but also on our mutual love for science education and then, more recently, on Waters. \u2047 Jim's legacy will live on with each and every one of our innovations as we continue to strive to deliver benefits. \u2047 Our teams around the globe have continued to manage admirably through the pandemic, which is still very much with us. \u2047 Most of all, we've kept the working environment safe for our employees and have remained flexible and resourceful as we continue to support our customers. \u2047 I remain grateful for the ongoing resilience, commitment and dedication that our team has shown. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 4. \u2047 During today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter operating results as well as some commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. \u2047 I will also update you on the progress of our transformation plan. \u2047 We continue to be focused on three primary objectives: number one, regaining our commercial momentum; number two, further strengthening our organization; and number three, building on a core -- on a strong core to access even higher growth areas. \u2047 Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated third quarter and full year financial outlook. \u2047 As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies. \u2047 Sales for this quarter represent a 6% compounded average yearly growth versus our 2019 results on a constant currency basis. \u2047 This translates to a 7% stacked CAGR versus 2019 for the first half of the year, again, on a constant currency basis. \u2047 Our strong top line growth resulted in year-over-year Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 24% to $2.60 per share. \u2047 Our top and bottom line performance translated into solid free cash flow performance and allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet. \u2047 Looking more closely at our top line results in the quarter on Slide 6. \u2047 First, by operating segment, our Waters Division grew 27%, while TA grew by 32% on a constant currency basis. \u2047 By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 31% in constant currency; industrial grew 28%; and academia and government grew 7%. \u2047 Continued strength in sales to pharma customers was broad-based across customer segments, geographies and applications. \u2047 Late-stage drug development activity drove sales of our tandem quad MS instrument systems such as the Xevo TQ-XS and Xevo TQ-S micro. \u2047 Small molecule applications in manufacturing QA and QC grew across Asia, Europe and North America and were particularly strong in India. \u2047 Industrial end market growth was also broad-based across geographies and applications, continuing its recovery so far this year. \u2047 Food testing and environmental demand grew nicely in the quarter, as did our thermal and geometric portfolios. \u2047 Turning to academic and government, which is less than 10% of our business, growth in the U.S. and Europe was partially offset by lumpiness in China. \u2047 Year-to-date, our primary geographies have all returned to growth versus last year. \u2047 Moving now to our sales performance by geography on a constant currency basis. \u2047 Sales in Asia grew 28%, with China up almost 40% and India up almost 60%. \u2047 Sales in the Americas grew 28% with the U.S. growing 26%, and sales in Europe grew 25%. \u2047 In the U.S., all end markets had strong year-over-year performance led by pharma and industrial. \u2047 Academic and government saw a return to growth for the quarter as the market continues to recover. \u2047 Europe's growth was also broad-based across end markets and subregions. \u2047 Overall, pharma drove growth with strong demand in small molecule and large molecule applications. \u2047 Industrial and academic and government markets continued their recovery, with both having strong quarters and strong starts to the first half of the year. \u2047 China sales were up sharply in our pharma business, and we had solid growth in our industrial and applied end markets there as well. \u2047 We're encouraged by our continued strength in the contract labs business due to strong execution of our growth initiatives. \u2047 In India, sales for the quarter were again very strong even as the country continued to feel the effects from the pandemic. \u2047 We're really grateful for the hard work and dedication of our colleagues who persevered through these challenging and tragic conditions. \u2047 Trends in Q2 and year-to-date for our LC instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for sustainable growth in consumables and service plans. \u2047 In the second quarter, LC instruments grew across all major geographies with more than 40% growth, driven by our instrument replacement initiatives and new products, especially Arc HPLC and a strong uptake of our Premier instruments, both Arc and ACQUITY lines. \u2047 This week, I spent time with customers at our Immerse innovation lab in Cambridge discussing the separation and purification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules. \u2047 While mRNA vaccines have developed at a record pace, we are far from solving key issues such as aggregation and selective binding of plasmids and mRNA molecules to various surfaces, something that our Premier technology addresses really well. \u2047 Further strengthening our UPLC portfolio, the Arc system was launched earlier this year for customers who need ultimate sensitivity. \u2047 The Arc Premier delivered fivefold improvement in detector sensitivity and tenfold improvement in assay-to-assay precision, helping labs accelerate time to market. \u2047 Mass spec sales grew in excess of 30%, driven by demand from pharma research and development and food and environmental applications. \u2047 This included high-resolution systems used for research applications such as the Xevo QTof, tandem quad led by our Xevo TQ-XS and TQ-S micro systems and our SQD and QDa single quad detectors utilized in high-performance LC-MS applications. \u2047 We introduced the Waters SELECT SERIES MRT, a high-resolution mass spectrometer that combines multi-reflecting time-of-flight MRT technology with both enhanced DESI and new MALDI imaging sources. \u2047 The MRT provides scientists with a unique combination of speed, resolution and mass accuracy especially relevant for applications in proteomics. \u2047 We have been in conversations with customers to see how we can collaborate using MRT to analyze libraries of samples to create a database of proteins and metabolites to further understand the impact of therapeutics on a variety of tissues. \u2047 Sales of precision chemistry columns, sample prep kits and reagents grew 28%, driven by increased utilization by our pharma customers and improved industrial demand. \u2047 Demand for our Premier Columns continues to be strong. \u2047 The low double-digit 2-year stack growth of chemistry columns revenue in Q2 when compared to our 2019 base underscores the rebound in customer activity, the strong position of our portfolio and building momentum of our e-commerce initiative. \u2047 Service also showed strong double-digit growth. \u2047 Our service engineers continue to have good and improved access to our customer sites, and I'm grateful for the way they have served customers while continuing to navigate the challenges of the pandemic. \u2047 Finally, with respect to TA, demand continues to rebound and was balanced across all major geographies and product lines, with particular strength in the U.S. and Europe. \u2047 Let me now give you some highlights on our progress with the implementation of our transformation plan on Slide 7. \u2047 Starting with our first priority, regaining our commercial momentum. \u2047 We continue to see progress in our instrument replacement initiative. \u2047 Our recently released Arc HPLC has played an important role in the LC replacement initiative. \u2047 Its improved mechanical specs and ability to seamlessly transfer networks from Alliance HPLC or other HPLC platforms have been very well received by our customers. \u2047 We are already crossing a mid-single-digit stack growth versus 2019 on a year-to-date basis in LC. \u2047 With our CRO and CDMO customers, our ability to develop and provide method transfer support continues to be a strong driver of growth. \u2047 This segment grew 60% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2019. \u2047 Early strength that we saw in China has now been replicated in Europe as well as in the U.S. \u2047 Our e-commerce and recurring revenue attachment initiatives are also starting to boost the momentum observed in our year-to-date 2-year stacked CAGR for chemistry and service revenue. \u2047 Moving on to our second priority on Slide 8. \u2047 We have strengthened our organization with the addition of Wei Jiang to our Board of Directors. \u2047 Wei currently serves as President of Bayer Pharmaceuticals for China and APAC. \u2047 His results-driven experience will further expand the perspective of the Board that directly aligns with what is the strategy to accelerate growth and innovation. \u2047 Dan joins us from Bristol Myers, where he was VP of Worldwide Commercialization Strategy and Innovation. \u2047 Dan joins several of our other technically trained Executive Committee members with experience in orchestrating transformations and M&A in relevant customer segments like pharma and diagnostics. \u2047 This brings me to our third priority of building our core to drive durable growth. \u2047 As you will see on Slide 9, Waters already has a strong foundation in large and growing end markets with a leading position of science and innovation in a roughly $65 billion market, a high exposure to end markets that grow around mid-single digits with a deep rooted presence in regulated end markets like QA/QC, a large installed base of instruments with over 50% recurring revenues, a diversified geographic base with over -- almost 40% sales in Asia and industry-leading margins with a strong financial flexibility. \u2047 So you'll agree with me that this is a solid base to build off. \u2047 Now I'm on Slide 10. \u2047 We built a team of leaders who have a strong track record of execution. \u2047 Both Jon Pratt and Jianqing Bennett, Heads of the Waters Division and the TA Division, respectively, are highly experienced commercial leaders and are now very focused on building capabilities to sustain our commercial momentum. \u2047 What gives me most pleasure is that we have started to hit our stride with new product introductions across the portfolio, and these are contributing to our sales momentum already. \u2047 The leadership that is focused on execution and innovation is preparing us well to further build our portfolio to access even faster-growing adjacencies. \u2047 We're exploring and nurturing opportunities both organic and inorganic to increase our exposure to biologics, be it bioprocessing reagents or novel modalities. \u2047 We're actively shaping the promise of LC-MS in diagnostics and proteomics discovery applications and advancing lab connectivity applications through our informatics portfolio. \u2047 High growth areas such as sustainable polymers and renewable energy are a focus of the TA division. \u2047 In summary, we've had a strong start to the year with a broad base -- with broad-based contributions from our end markets, product portfolio and geographies to our revenue growth. \u2047 In addition to the impressive growth versus our 2020 base of comparison, our business dynamics and customer demand look healthy on a 2-year run rate basis. \u2047 Markets we serve are in a healthy state, and our geographic regions are rebounding solidly from pandemic lows. \u2047 We remain focused on the continued progress and success of our short-term initiatives aimed at tactically strengthening our core business. \u2047 We're confident in the opportunities ahead to bring LC-MS products, separations expertise and compliant data management experience into high-growth biopharma and diagnostic applications. \u2047 I look forward to continuing to share more with you as we progress on these various fronts. \u2047 With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the second quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. \u2047 As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $682 million in the second quarter, an increase of 27% in constant currency. \u2047 Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 31%. \u2047 Looking at the product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents combination of chemistry and service revenue, increased by 18% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 40%. \u2047 Chemistry revenues were up 28%, and service revenues were up 13%. \u2047 As we noted in our last earnings call, recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. \u2047 Looking ahead, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of days for the third quarter either. \u2047 However, please note there are six fewer days in the fourth quarter of this year compared to 2020. \u2047 Now I would like to comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. \u2047 Before I do so, a reminder that in the second quarter of 2020, we took decisive actions to manage our costs as part of our near-term cost savings plan in light of the pandemic. \u2047 While our COVID cost savings plan was successful totaling approximately $100 million for 2020, it does have some implications in our year-over-year comparisons as we normalize from an abnormally low expense base. \u2047 Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by 80 basis points foreign exchange headwinds. \u2047 Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, gross margin improved by 70 basis points despite higher instrument mix and COVID cost actions in 2020. \u2047 This improvement was driven by volume leverage and productivity gains. \u2047 Moving down the P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 39% on a constant currency basis and 42% on a reported basis. \u2047 The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor costs and variable compensation, the majority of which relates to normalization of the prior year cost actions. \u2047 In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%, a decrease from last year as the comparable period included some unfavorable discrete items. \u2047 Our average share count came in at 62.2 million shares, approximately flat versus the second quarter of last year. \u2047 Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 24% to $2.60 in comparison to $2.10 last year. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased"], "gold_summary": ["compname
