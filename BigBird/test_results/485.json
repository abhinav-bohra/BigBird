{"article": ["This information is available on our Investor Relations website, investors. \u2047 We direct you to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. \u2047 During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations, or FFO; core FFO, same-center net operating income, and adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 As such, it is important to note that management's comments include time-sensitive information that may only be accurate as of today's date, May 6, 2021. \u2047 [Operator Instructions] On the call today will be Steven Tanger, our Executive Chair; Stephen Yalof, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 We are encouraged by a greater macro outlook over the past 90 days as vaccination rollout continues and an improving retail environment, as evidenced by the Consumer Confidence Index in late April, reaching its highest level since the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 The improvement we are starting to see in some of our operating metrics reflects the excellent value proposition that our open-air centers provide for both retailers and shoppers. \u2047 We are confident that, by continuing to make progress executing on our strategy, we'll position the company to return to sustained growth over time. \u2047 We're pleased to share that traffic to our domestic open-air centers in the first quarter nearly returned to 2019 levels and exceeded 2019 levels in April. \u2047 We continued to make progress on our core priorities for the business: leasing, operating and marketing our outlet centers. \u2047 We are focused on rebuilding our occupancy, driving leasing, and curating our merchandise mix to maximize shopper frequency and dwell time, and to bring new customers to Tanger Centers. \u2047 Consolidated portfolio occupancy was 91.7% at the end of the quarter, up only 20 basis points from the end of 2020. \u2047 This reflects the anticipated 61,000 square feet of space recaptured during the quarter related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings. \u2047 Blended average rental rates decreased 2.8% on a straight-line basis and 8.5% on a cash basis for all renewals and retenanted leases that commenced during the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2021. \u2047 However, this reflects a 300 basis-point improvement on a cash basis, a 390 basis-point improvement on a straight-line basis compared to our reported Q4 2020 spreads. \u2047 We believe we will continue to see improvement longer-term as positive traffic and sales trends will support driving better rents. \u2047 However, in the near term, we anticipate that we will continue to see pressure on retenanting spreads this year as we fill recaptured space that was at rental rates above the portfolio average. \u2047 Collections of contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 95%. \u2047 Through April 30, 2021, we collected 96% of the deferred 2020 rents due to be repaid in the first quarter and had collected 83% of all deferred 2020 rents, leaving a balance of only $3.7 million. \u2047 Given this run rate, we're comfortable with our outlook for future collections. \u2047 Meaningful rebound in traffic that we discussed last quarter has been sustained. \u2047 For the first quarter, domestic traffic returned to 97% of the 2019 level even as February traffic was impacted by severe winter weather, and we were still operating at 20% fewer hours. \u2047 We believe a comparison to 2019 is more relevant as we started to feel the impacts of the pandemic during March of last year. \u2047 Our strong and sustained traffic levels clearly reflects the attraction of our open-air shopping centers, their dominant market locations, and the value proposition that we offer to both our retailer partners and shoppers. \u2047 Note that in Canada, where we have two unconsolidated JV properties, stores had been closed under government mandate through mid-February and are again closed under mandate. \u2047 The trailing 12 months, 280 leases commenced, totaling over 1.4 million square feet. \u2047 Renewals executed or in process as of March 31 represented 52% of the space scheduled to expire during the year compared to 63% at the same time last year. \u2047 The slower-than-usual pace reflects our decision to strategically delay some of our renewal leasing activity as the overall economic and retail environments improve. \u2047 We continue to expand relationships with our traditional tenants, and we are seeing a measured pace of new leasing activity, with particular interest coming from the higher-end brands. \u2047 Developing new business with local and regional brands is one of our leasing priorities. \u2047 This initiative provides compelling opportunities to add new and interesting concepts to our centers and, with it, more variety for our shoppers. \u2047 Additionally, we continue to expand our tenant mix beyond apparel and footwear, growing such categories of food and beverage, interactive and experiential, home d? \u2047 cor and design, housewares, sporting goods, and gourmet grocers. \u2047 As a result, we are reimagining design elements for our centers. \u2047 In Grand Rapids, Michigan, for example, we have created outdoor seating in a gathering space in connection with the new microbrew restaurant located in a formerly underutilized part of our center. \u2047 In our Hilton Head Center, iconic gourmet grocer, Nantucket Meat & Fish, is currently under construction for Memorial Day Grand opening. \u2047 Our partnership with Fillogic, the logistics-as-a-service platform in Deer Park, has provided for 5,000 square feet of a micro distribution hub aimed at providing lower cost and efficient distribution solutions for our retailers and shoppers. \u2047 We continue to deliver strong pop-up leasing activity, which serves several important functions: introducing new brands to the outlet channel that may convert to long-term permanent tenants, creating retail vibrancy in an otherwise dark store; providing variety to the center and more choice for our shoppers, delivering immediate NOI contributions; and, in certain cases, allowing us to maintain occupancy on a temporary basis as we defer long-term leases for market improvement. \u2047 This tenancy represented approximately 8.6% of our consolidated portfolio total GLA as of March 31, 2021. \u2047 Though elevated from previous levels, this is a proven approach that has historically benefited our centers. \u2047 Since joining Tanger one year ago, our top priority has been evolving our operational discipline by empowering our field leadership team to drive local leasing, business development and operational efficiencies at the center level. \u2047 These efforts have proven effective and are reflected in our better-than-planned short-term leasing, paid media and operating expense contributions. \u2047 Revenues derived from non-rental transactions, such as paid media and sponsorships. \u2047 also provided a significant contribution to the Other Revenues line in the first quarter of 2021, driving a 14% increase year-over-year. \u2047 We have decentralized shopping center operations, with each center's management team now participating in revenue generation and empowered with decision-making authority regarding operating expenses. \u2047 At the same time, we are centralizing certain procurement activities to benefit from the scale of our organization. \u2047 One thing the COVID environment reinforced is the importance of meeting the customer where they are and creating a more personalized experience. \u2047 Our marketing and digital transformation teams have continued to expand our virtual shopper offering, curbside pickup with fluid interactive capabilities, and live stream shopping, and offer digital pre-shopping on the Tanger app and website. \u2047 Our digital initiatives are aimed at creating a highly personalized relationship for users and further building our loyalty base by providing more relevant offers and content to our individual shoppers. \u2047 Our operating strategy evolves, our commitment to environmental, social and governance efforts remains unchanged. \u2047 In 2021, we have launched a comprehensive materiality assessment conducted by a third party to ensure that we are addressing the ESG issues most important to our stakeholders and that these issues are integrated into our core values. \u2047 Our Board and executive leadership team are engaged on ESG issues impacting the organization, and we are investing time and resources to grow our diversity, equity and inclusion program. \u2047 We believe that education is essential to embedding DE&I throughout our culture and are launching unconscious bias training for our senior leadership team, which will be rolled out throughout the organization. \u2047 We are also investing in our communities in new ways, including through our newly implemented small business owner outreach initiative. \u2047 Through this program, we're offering opportunities for new and existing businesses in our communities to set up shop in Tanger Centers supported by our proprietary suite of services to help them incubate and grow. \u2047 In 2021, we will continue our efforts to streamline ESG reporting so that the data is more accessible to stakeholders and easier to navigate. \u2047 To improve our transparency and reporting on our ESG efforts, we will begin to implement the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures during 2021 with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy performance, biodiversity, water and usage and waste management. \u2047 These projects have impact on the global environment, broader Tanger's environmental efforts beyond our immediate footprint, and provide additional opportunities to engage with our employees, retailers and shoppers. \u2047 Our team remains focused on a return to sustained growth. \u2047 We have strengthened our balance sheet and are exploring selective growth opportunities. \u2047 We are restarting our marketing efforts for our planned Nashville development and, as restrictions are lifted, prospective tenants are making site business. \u2047 Progress we are making across each of our strategic priorities gives us confidence that we will create long-term value for our shareholders. \u2047 First quarter results showed continued positive momentum but reflect the ongoing impact of the pandemic, recent bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings. \u2047 First quarter core FFO available to common shareholders was $0.40 per share compared to $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Core FFO for the first quarter of 2021 excludes general and administrative expense of $2.4 million, or $0.02 per share for compensation costs related to a voluntary retirement plan and other executive severance costs. \u2047 Same-center NOI for the consolidated portfolio decreased 8% for the quarter. \u2047 This reflects the rent modifications and store closings from recent bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings, partially offset by the reversal of approximately $1.6 million in reserves related to rents previously deferred or under negotiation. \u2047 Collections of contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 95%. \u2047 We also continue to collect rent bill for prior periods, including amounts related to 2020 that we allowed our tenants to defer to 2021. \u2047 As of March 31, 2021, remaining rental revenue reserves for 2020 rents deferred or under negotiation totaled $2.6 million. \u2047 Since implementing our ATM program, in March we opportunistically raised capital to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet. \u2047 During the first quarter, we issued 6.9 million common shares that generated $128.7 million in net proceeds at a weighted average price of $19.02 per share. \u2047 We used the proceeds to reduce $25 million of borrowings under our $350 million unsecured term loan on March 11, 2021; and, on April 30, completed the partial early redemption of $150 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% senior notes due December 2023 for $163 million in cash. \u2047 Subsequent to the redemption, $100 million remains outstanding. \u2047 We have no significant debt maturities until December 2023. \u2047 As previously disclosed, we expect to take a charge in the second quarter of 2021 currently estimated to be approximately $14.1 million, or $0.14 per share, including an approximately $13 million make-whole premium to be paid for the early redemption of the notes and $1.1 million in unamortized debt discount and loan costs. \u2047 The charge will impact our second quarter net income and FFO but will have no impact on core FFO. \u2047 We expect the 2021 net dilutive impact per share to be approximately $0.12 for net income, $0.18 for FFO, and $0.04 for core FFO. \u2047 This reduction in debt improves our leverage ratio and enhances our balance sheet flexibility. \u2047 We have always prioritized maintaining a strong financial position. \u2047 We will continue our disciplined and prudent approach to capital allocation. \u2047 In addition to dividend distributions sufficient to maintain REIT status, our priority uses of capital include investing in our portfolio to grow NOI, reducing leverage to pre-COVID levels over time, and evaluating selective growth opportunities over the longer term. \u2047 Our outlook for 2021 remains unchanged. \u2047 While we are encouraged by the pace of our progress, we continue to anticipate pressure from current vacancies, additional potential store closures and rent modifications. \u2047 As mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect store closures during 2021 related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings to total approximately 200,000 square feet during 2021, including the 61,000 square feet we recaptured during the first quarter. \u2047 Most of the recapture should occur during the first half of the year. \u2047 Additionally, our guidance assumes there are no further domestic government-mandated shutdowns and assumed lease termination fees decrease by $9 million to $10 million, or $0.09 to $0.10 per share from the elevated level we recognized in 2020. \u2047 Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect core FFO per share for 2021 to be between $1.47 and $1.57. \u2047 We are maintaining this guidance despite the $0.04 dilutive impact previously discussed. \u2047 For additional details on our key assumptions, please see our release issued last night. \u2047 Operator, can we take our first question? \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q1 core ffo per share $0.40.
