{"article": ["With that said, let's have our usual cautionary reminder. \u2047 Such factors can include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policy, competitive pressures, and various other risks that are detailed in the Company's SEC reports and filings. \u2047 2020 was a year that was fraught with changing demands and conditions, and our people weathered the storm admirably. \u2047 We met our critical objective of keeping the workplace safe and healthy for our employees with virtually no work-related transmission. \u2047 This, in turn, enabled us to operate continuously, and to serve our customers reliably in all regions. \u2047 By comparison, the Top 5 public companies in our sector were on average, flat on both the top and bottom line. \u2047 While David will be giving you more detail on this and other aspects of our financial performance, I would like to cover a few highlights. \u2047 Over the course of 2020, we committed to improving our balance sheet and I'm pleased to report that we succeeded in doing so. \u2047 We generated a nine-fold increase in cash from operations versus the prior year due, in part, from inventory and factory management, controlled operating expenses, and record high customer early pay participation. \u2047 This, in turn, enabled us to pay down debt and improve borrowing capacity. \u2047 We are able to make these improvements while, at the same time, concluding two key strategic acquisitions; AgNova, for market access in Australia, and Agrinos, a green solutions company. \u2047 Further, we defined an environmental, social and governance platform, which includes extremely promising products and technology solutions. \u2047 Now, I would like to turn to David for his comments on our financial performance, with the focus on matters of particular interest to our investors. \u2047 I will then give you my thoughts on our growth platforms, and a particular focus on green solutions and precision application. \u2047 I will then close with my 2021 outlook, and then take questions from our listeners. \u2047 With regard to our public filing, we plan to file our Form 10-K for 2020 within the next few days. \u2047 As we have noted in previous calls, the Company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries, in which we operate. \u2047 As a result, throughout 2020, our customers and suppliers, and our employees and operations have all continued more or less without disruption during the pandemic. \u2047 Having said that, the pandemic has impacted us in a few ways including, first, at the start of the year, we experienced a significant devaluation in a few key currencies, specifically, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, and the Australian dollar. \u2047 That negative currency effect has started to somewhat reverse as we reached the end of 2020. \u2047 Second, the pandemic prevented us from many of our normal infield activities, including face-to-face meetings with distributors, retailers or growers, or activities such as product development and defense. \u2047 On the other hand, as you will see in our financial statements, the same restrictions and foreign exchange rate movements have caused us to spend less on operating expenses, including travel. \u2047 With regard to our financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company's net sales increased by 8% to $141 million, as compared to sales of $131 million, this time last year. \u2047 Within that overall improvement, our US sales were up 4% to $85 million, and our international sales increased by 15% to $56 million. \u2047 International sales accounted for 39% of total sales, as compared to 37% of total sales, this time last year. \u2047 The main factor -- factors driving our sales performance are as follows. \u2047 In our US crop market, sales increased by approximately 19% as a result of strong sales of products sold into the Midwest row crop market such as, our SmartBox, Counter, and Aztec brands, as growers reacted to increased blood pressure and on to increased commodity pricing for soybeans and corn. \u2047 Sales for our domestic non-crop market declined about 45% as a result of lower sales of our deep Dibrom products into vector control districts, primarily as customers worked to address slightly elevated channel inventory levels. \u2047 Finally, our international sales grew by 15%. \u2047 Approximately half of the improvement is associated with new sales related to the two businesses acquired at the start of the quarter. \u2047 The balance of the increase relates to strong sales of our bromacil herbicide, which has a much improved supply position this year and Counter sold into Mexico. \u2047 With regard to the underlying market performance of our products, during the quarter, our US crop business recorded increased absolute gross profit, but gross margin percentage declined slightly. \u2047 The decline in gross margin percentage was driven primarily by the lower manufacturing activity, which is typical for the Company's fourth quarter. \u2047 Our fourth quarter non-crop gross margin declined from 42% in Q4 of 2019 to 35% in 2020, driven primarily by the reduced market demand for Dibrom already discussed, and by the lower factory activity rate. \u2047 International margins improve with the addition of businesses acquired in the fourth quarter, and strong sales of bromacil, reflecting improved material supply. \u2047 Overall, gross margin performance for the final quarter of 2020 was in line with the prior year at 36%. \u2047 Operating expenses for the quarter increased by 11% as compared to the same period of the prior year. \u2047 This includes the addition of the activities of the two newly acquired businesses, which together accounted for approximately 40% of the increase. \u2047 Other increases include, additional marketing expenses, legal expenses, higher cash incentive compensation accruals linked to business performance, and some expense associated with the change in the fair value contingent liabilities associated with an acquisition. \u2047 This relates to a business that we purchased out of bankruptcy. \u2047 When the opportunity presented itself, we moved quickly and got a great deal. \u2047 We engaged outside valuation experts to assist management in the assessment of the fair value of the assets acquired. \u2047 The gain we recorded is the difference between the purchase price consideration paid and the fair value of the net assets acquired. \u2047 Also during the three-month period, we recorded lower interest expense, primarily as a result of lower federal base rates on our loans. \u2047 Finally, our effective tax rate was low in the quarter. \u2047 There are couple of reasons for this. \u2047 First, the bargain purchase, just discussed, is a non-taxable transaction. \u2047 And second, we were able to release some reserves associated with uncertain tax positions related to acquisitions we made in both 2017 and 2019. \u2047 As a result of these various factors, net income for the three-month period was more than twice the level reported in the same period of 2019. \u2047 With regard to the full-year performance, the overall business revenues reduced by about 2% in 2019, as compared to 2019 -- in 2020, as compared to 2019. \u2047 We consider that performance to be reasonably aligned with the prior year in a period that has been marked by widespread closure of many businesses during the prolonged period the pandemic. \u2047 Within that revenue decline, our US crop business increased by 1% to $223 million in 2020, our US non-crop business sales declined by 21%, to end at $49 million, and our international business remained approximately flat with new business revenue offsetting the effect of foreign exchange rates. \u2047 Our 2020 manufacturing performance ended the year very close to our average long-term performance. \u2047 As you can see from the chart, net factory costs for the year amounted to approximately 2.8% of sales. \u2047 This compares to 2.6% for 2019, and our target of 2.5%. \u2047 This says, that despite all the pandemic-related challenges, we were able to maintain our manufacturing activity at relatively normal levels. \u2047 For the full year 2020, despite some movements by category, gross margin percentage was in line with 2019, at 38%. \u2047 For the full year of 2020, our operating expenses increased by 2%, to end at $154 million, or 33% of sales as compared to $151 million, or 32% of sales last year. \u2047 In 2020, we had several dynamics affecting our operating expenses. \u2047 These include, pandemic-related reductions in travel activities, the impact of lower FX rates affecting translation to US dollars of operating costs recorded in other currencies, and finally the addition of new businesses acquired in the final quarter of the year. \u2047 Our interest expense is down primarily because of federal reserve base rates. \u2047 Our tax expense is down primarily because of the bargain purchase gain, which is non-taxable, and the release of reserves in certain tax positions related to prior acquisitions. \u2047 In summary, for the full year 2020, when looking at our income statement performance, we have operated close to normal. \u2047 Margins have remained very steady, indicating that prices have held up, raw material costs and factory performance has been well managed throughout this year of disruption. \u2047 Our operating costs have increased slightly, but do include additional businesses for both the quarter and the year. \u2047 We made a good deal to inquire -- to acquire an exciting biologicals business for a bargain price out of[Phonetic] bankruptcy. \u2047 And at the bottom line, we've seen a very strong finish to 2020 and reported net income, up 12% compared to 2019. \u2047 From my perspective, the operating and financial focus for the Company remains as follows. \u2047 We continue to follow a disciplined approach to planning our factory activity, balancing overhead recovery with demand forecasts and inventory levels. \u2047 As you can see on this slide, we've had a very strong year with respect to cash in 2020. \u2047 We generated slightly less from operations when compared to prior year, but have been focused full year on working capital, and this slide shows that has gone very well. \u2047 Including working capital, we generated $89 million from operations, which is about nine times what we have achieved on a -- in average for the prior two years. \u2047 The cash generated was used principally to two purposes. \u2047 First, we invested a total of $36 million, acquiring two businesses, making a strategic equity investment, continuing to develop our manufacturing capability, and advancing our SIMPAS delivery systems. \u2047 Secondly, we paid down debt by $43 million. \u2047 At the end of December 2020, our inventories were at $164 million. \u2047 This includes about $14 million of inventory related to acquisitions completed since late December 2019. \u2047 And adjusted or underlying inventory of $152 million is slightly better than the $154 million we indicated during the last call. \u2047 With regard to accounts receivable, as I noted earlier, our customers have continued to operate without significant disruption. \u2047 They are placing orders for our products, making payments when expected. \u2047 Participation in our annual standard early pay program was strong, indicating that our customers -- that the customers we deal with had a good year. \u2047 The end result for 2020 resulted in consolidated accounts receivable of $119 million in 2020, as compared to $136 million, this time last year, notwithstanding the higher sales in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Consequently, we can report that despite the pandemic, we have not seen any material change in the assessment of our credit risk exposure at the end of 2020 in comparison to the prior year. \u2047 With regard to liquidity, as you can see from this chart, we have been constantly working down debt from a high in the first quarter, which is a normal rhythm for the Company, to a low at the end of the year. \u2047 At the same time, after a challenging first quarter, which was impacted by the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, our quarterly financials have steadily improved. \u2047 There are three factors in the calculation of availability. \u2047 The first is our financial performance, which is broadly in line. \u2047 The second is the multiplayer under the terms of the credit facility, which is slightly higher this year than last, and accounts for about $15 million increase in availability. \u2047 And the third is the level of debt, which accounts for $43 million increase in availability. \u2047 Taking all that together, availability at December 31, 2020 is $85 million, as compared to $27 million for the same time last year. \u2047 In summary then, in 2020 from a balance sheet cash perspective, we have continued to be acquisitive for the long-term benefit of the Company. \u2047 We have carefully managed inventory and accounts receivable and, thereby, working capital, cash and debt. \u2047 At the end of the year, we believe we have improved our balance sheet and liquidity, and are well positioned to look at 2021 with a sense of optimism. \u2047 With that, I will hand back to Eric. \u2047 As you may recall from our earnings call in November last year, I began to turn our attention to our strategic direction and long-term prospects. \u2047 In the course of my comments, I described our three platforms for growth, namely, our core business, our green solutions platform, and our precision application technology, led by SIMPAS and Ultimus. \u2047 I also gave you a view into how much we think these platforms will grow over the next three years to five years. \u2047 Today, I would like to revisit these platforms with a particular focus on how our green solutions and precision application technology, both provide unique and compelling environmental -- what I'll call, ESG, environmental, social and governance solutions, and position us to grow our business at a faster rate than through conventional AgChem offerings. \u2047 Let's start with a quick update on our core business. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, in Q4 we closed on the acquisition of AgNova, an Australian-based company, headquartered in Melbourne that sources, develops and distributes specialty crop protection and protection solutions for the agriculture, horticulture and non-crop markets. \u2047 The addition of AgNova, improves our market access in the region, including with respect to SIMPAS, Agrinos, and green plant solutions, and gives us greater critical mass in an important territory. \u2047 Furthermore, AgNova offers product lines that we can readily market in other regions. \u2047 Now let's turn to the other two platforms. \u2047 In doing so, it is first necessary to lay the proper groundwork. \u2047 I mentioned earlier, we have defined our ESG position. \u2047 Public companies, far and wide, are increasingly being called upon by investors such as, BlackRock happens to be our largest shareholders, institutional shareholder services like ISS, and regulators such as the SEC to report upon their commitment to ESG. \u2047 We at American Vanguard, have a great story to tell with regard to ESG. \u2047 As I take you through our green solutions and precision application technology platforms, you will see this more clearly. \u2047 At the close of 2020, we published our statement under the tab ESG on our website. \u2047 As we stated on that page, we are committed to the principal of sustainable agriculture, which to us means that all people should have the right to a stable, affordable food supply both now and into the future while, at the same time, maintaining and preferably improving soil health. \u2047 As an essential part of that commitment"], "gold_summary": ["american vanguard corp q4 net sales were $141 million in 2020, compared to $131 million in 2019."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q4
