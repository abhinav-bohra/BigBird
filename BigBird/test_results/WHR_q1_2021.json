and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. \u2047 Synchrony delivered strong results during the second quarter, reflecting the power of our technology-enabled model, the durability of our partner-centric value proposition, and the early indications of a consumer resurgence. \u2047 With now more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic moving into the rearview mirror, I am proud of how our team has continued to execute on our strategic priorities. \u2047 Our multi-product, multi-capability strategy has enabled us to nimbly adapt and deliver best-in-class products and services to address our partners' evolving needs, while also generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns for all our stakeholders. \u2047 Let's get things started by reviewing some of the key financial highlights from the quarter. \u2047 Net earnings reached a record $1.2 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share. \u2047 This reflected an increase of $2.06 over last year as we mark the anniversary of the pandemic's initial impact on our business and really, the world. \u2047 We are deeply grateful for all of the front line workers, scientists and leaders have done to support our community and make progress toward an eventual return to normalcy. \u2047 Purchase volume grew 35% over last year, reflecting a 33% increase in purchase volume per account. \u2047 This increased spend was broad-based across our five business platforms. \u2047 This strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from the government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions, leading to a slight increase in loan receivables, which were $78.4 billion for the second quarter. \u2047 Average balances per account were down about 4% for the period, while new accounts were up about 58%. \u2047 Net interest margin of 13.78% was 25 basis points higher than last year. \u2047 Elevated payment rates and excess liquidity levels continue to have an impact on receivables and yield. \u2047 The efficiency ratio was 39.6% for the quarter, primarily reflecting lower net interest income. \u2047 Expenses were down about 4%, compared to last year and down 5% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned. \u2047 We remain on track to remove about $210 million from our expense base by year end, even as we continue to invest in our business. \u2047 Credit continue to perform very well. \u2047 Net charge-offs were 3.57% for the second quarter, down almost 178 basis points from last year. \u2047 Turning to our balance sheet. \u2047 Deposits were down $4 billion, or 7% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity position. \u2047 Deposits represented 81% of our funding mix at quarter end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of some of our debt during the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 During the quarter, we returned $521 million in capital through share repurchases of $393 million and $128 million in common stock dividends. \u2047 We also continue to reinvest in our business. \u2047 One of our greatest competitive differentiators remains our digital capabilities. \u2047 We continue to invest in innovative products and services that enable our partners to meet their customers wherever and however they want to be met. \u2047 That where and how, of course, can change fairly quickly, as can the objectives that our partners seek to achieve. \u2047 So we need to stay nimble and ahead of the curve. \u2047 We have continued to win and renew key partnerships, including our recent renewal with TJX Companies. \u2047 This has been a very valuable partnership for over 10 years now, and we are excited to continue to provide innovative financing products to TJX customers. \u2047 We also renewed 10 other programs during the quarter, including Shop HQ, Daniels, and Sutherlands and added four new programs, including JCB and Ochsner Health. \u2047 Our go-to-market strategy utilizes innovative and scalable ways to reach and serve customers effectively across a broad spectrum of industries and financing needs and over the course of their life cycle. \u2047 We have built a technology platform that harnesses our proprietary data analytics, cutting edge digital capabilities to offer a customized suite of products specifically designed with our partners and their customers in mind, all while delivering appropriately aligned economic outcomes. \u2047 Our recent business reorganization, which included the creation of a growth organization and the redistribution of our partners from three sales platforms into five will allow us to better leverage these company resources and deliver swifter, more optimized products and capabilities for our partners and sustainable profitable growth for our business. \u2047 In fact, the growth we expect to achieve within each platform will be driven by utilizing our suite of products to expand lifetime value, deploying more of our digital capabilities to expand customer reach, or adapting our value propositions to harness organic trends as the landscape evolves. \u2047 In the case of our Home & Auto platform, a combination of all three. \u2047 In particular, our home partnerships have been a focus of Synchrony's going back to our business inception when we started providing financing for appliance purchases. \u2047 Over the years, we've significantly broadened the scope of this platform and expanded our customer reach. \u2047 Today, Synchrony has penetrated across all distribution points in each sector of the home market, from big retailers, to independent merchants and contractors and OEMs and dealers, our Home platform provides financing solutions to about 60,000 merchants and locations across a broad spectrum of industries, including furniture and accessories, mattresses and bedding, appliances, windows, roofing, HVAC and flooring. \u2047 Our partnerships are deeply rooted in industry expertise, data-driven strategic objectives, and mutually beneficial economic outcomes. \u2047 The average length of our top 20 partners is over 30 years, because we are able to deliver a breadth of financing products, innovative digital capabilities, and seamless customer experiences that are customized to each partners' needs as they evolve over time. \u2047 Our data insights and analytics expertise, when combined with the partners' own data, empowers each merchant as they seek to optimize their marketing, customer acquisition and sales strategies. \u2047 And the value that our suite of products provides to their customers is clear, about 58% of our sales are repeat purchases. \u2047 Whether customers are looking to upgrade their living room couch, or suddenly find themselves in need of a new washing machine, we enable our partners to consistently support those needs through a variety of financing options that are best suited to the customer and the particular purchase they're considering. \u2047 So, whether we've been entrusted to enhance customer loyalty, drive transaction volume, or usher a retailers' adoption of digital assets, our strategy has enabled steady growth across the home market. \u2047 For the four years prior to the pandemic, Synchrony's Home receivables grew at a 7% CAGR as consumers spend within home improvement, furniture and decor and electronic and appliances sectors each grew by between 4% and 8% annually. \u2047 Certainly, the pandemic has brought with it both challenges and opportunities. \u2047 As consumers quarantined in their homes, the desire to renovate their homes or upgrade their furniture and decor intensified. \u2047 As people thought to leave crowded metropolitan communities for suburban neighborhoods, home improvement spend increased. \u2047 In 2020 alone, the home industry represented an approximate $600 billion market opportunity. \u2047 Synchrony serves a fraction of that today. \u2047 Even as we normalize toward a pre-pandemic cadence, the consumers' desire to invest in their living spaces is as strong as ever, perhaps reflecting a secular shift in favor of more remote work. \u2047 We have positioned our Home platform very well to capitalize on these trends. \u2047 We have opportunities to deepen the scope and reach of existing partnerships, while also implementing a number of strategic initiatives to better leverage our core competencies and deepen our market penetration. \u2047 For example, we have begun using more data and advanced analytics to enhance our acquisition marketing and drive higher repeat sales. \u2047 We've also launched our direct-to-device capability, which puts the simplicity of our financing application and the power of our underwriting in the hands of the contractors and customers as they seek to install a new HVAC system, replace their windows or repair an oven. \u2047 This direct-to-device technology is also being deployed in retailer locations, which helps shorten checkout lines and delivers a completely digital solution to apply and buy when in store. \u2047 In short, we are excited about the opportunities for growth that we see in our Home platform. \u2047 There are certainly some natural tailwinds in the industry that should feel home spend even as life normalizes in a post-pandemic world. \u2047 But we are actually more excited about the ways in which we're leveraging our technological innovations to extend our customer reach, enhance the value of the products and services we offer, and deepen our competitive differentiation. \u2047 As we continue to execute on our long-term strategy, we are driving even greater customer lifetime value for our partners, better experiences for their customers and strong returns for our stakeholders. \u2047 As Brian mentioned earlier, the strong results we achieved during the second quarter reflected a number of factors. \u2047 First, a healthy consumer with significant savings and pent-up demand to spend it leading to broad-based purchase volume growth. \u2047 Second, continued strength in credit quality across our portfolio. \u2047 We continue to closely monitor our portfolio as industrywide forbearance begins to expire across the broader consumer finance landscape and for some customers, as rental forbearance also expires. \u2047 Finally, the strong positioning of our business, combined with consistent execution by our team, while we maintain focus on efficient delivery of customized financing solutions and digitally enabled customer experiences across our diverse portfolio of partners, merchants and providers focusing on the healthy consumer who has robust savings and desire to spend in an environment with improving economic trends. \u2047 During the second quarter, consumer savings rates remained strong, unemployment continued to improve and consumer confidence reached a 16-month high. \u2047 As a result, discretionary spend seems to be making a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 In fact, a conference board survey from June indicated that there is also a healthy interest among consumers to spend on long-lasting manufactured goods over the next six months, including homes, cars, and major household appliances, which we expect to be a positive tailwind for our Home & Auto platform in particular. \u2047 Across our diverse set of platforms, strong consumer spend trends contributed to 35% higher purchase volume compared to last year, primarily reflecting 33% stronger purchase volume per account. \u2047 When comparing these trends to the more normalized operating environment of the second quarter 2019, and excluding the impact of Walmart, purchase volume was 18% higher in the second quarter 2021 and purchase volume per account was 22% higher. \u2047 This demonstrates strong consumer demand translating to higher spend relative to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 39% of the purchase volume in the second quarter and increased 56% from last year. \u2047 On a loan receivables basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and were flat to the prior year. \u2047 Average active accounts were up about 2%, compared to last year and new accounts were 58% higher, totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the second quarter and over 11 million new accounts year-to-date. \u2047 Loan receivables reached $78.4 billion in the second quarter, a slight increase year-over-year as the period[Phonetic] strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by persistently elevated payment rate. \u2047 This marks the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. \u2047 Payment rate was almost 300 basis points higher when compared to last year, which primarily led to a 6% reduction in interest and fees on loans. \u2047 RSAs increased $233 million, or 30% from last year and were 5.25% of average receivables. \u2047 The increase relative to last year's second quarter was primarily reflecting the significant improvement in net charge-offs. \u2047 As a reminder, our retailer share arrangements are designed to share in the program's performance and when the portfolios are performing better on a risk-adjusted basis, our partner share in this performance. \u2047 So the RSA is performing as it is designed and the elevated levels we have seen over the last few quarters are a reflection of Synchrony's particular financial strength through the pandemic. \u2047 We continue to expect RSAs to decline as net charge-offs begin to rise. \u2047 With an improved credit performance and a more optimistic macroeconomic environment, we reduced our loan loss reserves by $878 million this quarter. \u2047 Other income decreased $6 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter. \u2047 Other expense decreased $38 million due to lower operational losses, partially offset by an increase in employee, marketing and business development, and information processing costs. \u2047 Moving to Slide 8 and our platform results. \u2047 We saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all five platforms as consumers have become increasingly confident and remaining local restrictions are being lifted. \u2047 Both our Health & Wellness and Diversified & Value platforms experienced more than 50% growth in purchase volume. \u2047 In Health & Wellness, this primarily reflected lifting of local restrictions on in-person interactions and consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing elective procedures. \u2047 The lifting of state restrictions was also a primary driver of the significant purchase volume growth in our Diversified & Value platform as consumers increased their discretionary spend in categories like clothing and assorted household goods. \u2047 Meanwhile, purchase volume grew by 30% in our Digital platform, 25% in Home & Auto and 9% in Lifestyle. \u2047 Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected stabilization or modest growth versus the prior year as the higher purchase volume was partially offset by the elevated payment rates. \u2047 The one exception being our Diversified & Value platform, which is also impacted by store closures in 2020. \u2047 Average active account trends were mixed on a platform basis, up by as much as 5% in Digital and down by as much as 6% in Health & Wellness. \u2047 The active account growth in Digital generally reflected the combination of a shift in the timing of an annual promotional events and the ramp up of some of our recent partner launches. \u2047 The active account decline in Health & Wellness was primarily associated with the continued strength in consumer balance sheets. \u2047 Interest and fees were generally down across the platforms, with the exception of Lifestyle due to lower yield as a result of elevated payment trends we've been discussing. \u2047 I'll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. \u2047 During the quarter, the continued combined impacts of the March stimulus and high savings balance"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly diluted earnings per share $2.12.  \u2047  qtrly net interest income decreased $84 million, or 2%, to $3.3 billion."], "pred_summary":
