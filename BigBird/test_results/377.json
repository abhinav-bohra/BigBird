{"article": ["I'm Quynh McGuire, Vice President of Investor Relations. \u2047 You may access this announcement via our website at www. \u2047 As indicated in our announcement, we've also posted materials to the Investor Relations page of our website that will be referenced in today's call. \u2047 References may also be made today to certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Joining me for our call today are Leroy Ball, President and CEO of Koppers; and Mike Zugay, Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 I'll now turn over this discussion to Leroy. \u2047 As the pandemic continues, I hope that you and those you care about remain safe and healthy. \u2047 And I'd also like to wish all of you a happy healthy and prosperous 2021. \u2047 Our next call will be on February 24th, to report final 2020 results and provide our view into 2021 at that time. \u2047 As the starting point for today is shown on Slide 4, Koppers has continued to retain its designation as an essential business as determined by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or CISA within the Department of Homeland Security. \u2047 I mean, we've been able to continue operating during the pandemic to transport critical goods, provide power and connectivity to homes and businesses, and keep our infrastructure running reliably. \u2047 We at Koppers, take great pride in carrying out this critical responsibility. \u2047 In many ways, last year, seemed like a whirlwind of activity as we work to adapt to the many changes brought on by the pandemic while serving our essential customer base with critical products and services. \u2047 Through a different lens, there were also periods where it seems the time stood still as many team members adjusted to the different stress points of working virtually. \u2047 Collectively, we're all happy to move past 2020 and step closer to seeing return to our new normal. \u2047 Same time there is a lot to look back on fondly, as it relates to Koppers' performance last year, and I'd be remiss if I didn't point out some of the highlights. \u2047 So let's move to Slide 6. \u2047 As I usually do, I'd like to start with an update on a number of achievements related to our Zero Harm culture. \u2047 I'm proud to announce that operationally, we finished 2020 with our lowest total recordable rate for any 12-month period in our company's history. \u2047 We have been successfully holding firm and emphasizing the importance of leading activities such as hazard identification to driving down exposure in injury rates. \u2047 Throughout 2020, we saw a 30% increase in leading activities and a corresponding 20% decrease in recordable cases, which is quite significant. \u2047 In November, we held a modified virtual version of our Leadership Forum with key team members worldwide who are responsible for the care and well-being of our team members. \u2047 Koppers' primary focus was on aligning the expectations of leadership at Koppers to ensure we are working toward a safer, stronger, and more inclusive workplace. \u2047 In December, we held our annual safety, health, and environmental coordinator conference also virtually, providing interactive training on best practices to reduce harm to the environment and better protect our people. \u2047 Despite what has been a chaotic year due to the unexpected challenges associated with COVID-19, these accomplishments prove that our team is not slowing down our efforts to ensure safety, but rather figuring out new and innovative ways to keep us pushing down the path to zero. \u2047 On the financial side of things, we also expect to finish the year on a positive note in spite of much in our world being turned on its head. \u2047 Our consolidated sales for the year at $1.67 billion represents a new high in the fourth consecutive year of growth when we exclude KJCC from prior results. \u2047 Now, while not yet final, we do expect to finish the year with a new high for operating profit of approximately $161 million, which would represent a 28% increase from 2019. \u2047 2020 will also represent a new-high watermark for adjusted EBITDA excluding KJCC as we expect to finish between $211 million and $212 million. \u2047 Now this compares to $201 million earned in 2019 and exceeds both our recent guidance range of $204 million to $210 million and even more incredibly exceeds our original pre-pandemic guidance for the year of $200 million to $210 million of EBITDA. \u2047 That level of EBITDA equates to a margin of 12.6% to 12.7%, which will be our highest margin since 2017. \u2047 It will also be the fifth straight year with adjusted EBITDA margins between 12% and 14% after seven straight years with margins hovering between 8% and 11%, just another indication of how we have truly transformed our business model. \u2047 For the year, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.20 per share, which again would represent a new high for Koppers beating our previous high of $3.68 per share back in 2017. \u2047 2020's expected result would represent an approximate 30% increase over 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $3.18. \u2047 Finally, we will have saved approximately $9.5 million in SG&A cost compared to 2019. \u2047 That's about $2.5 million shy of our original goal of $12 million, which was primarily due to our better-than-expected performance resulting in higher bonus accruals, and special bonuses paid out to our team members at year-end for their extraordinary efforts in extraordinary times. \u2047 Our balance sheet and cash flow perspective is outlined on Slide 7. \u2047 In addition to receiving $65 million of net proceeds from selling our KJCC coal tar distillation facility in China at the end of September, we also had one of our strongest cash flow years generating over $120 million of cash, which will go down as our second-best cash flow year ever. \u2047 Now, doing so enabled us to reduce net debt by $131.5 million, which represents our largest net-debt reduction in any given year in our public company history. \u2047 Finally, the combination of the higher EBITDA generation and strong-debt reduction allowed us to reduce our net leverage ratio to 3.5 as of year-end compared to 4.3 at the end of 2019. \u2047 This is the first year-end since 2017 that we finished the year with net leverage below 4 times as we continue to remain focused on reducing leverage to average between 2 and 3 times. \u2047 We spent just under $70 million of capital for the year, which was near the high-end of our most recent guidance and was primarily due to the treatment expansion project North Little Rock. \u2047 On a final note, the book value per share of our equity has never been higher as we finish out 2020. \u2047 It was truly an extraordinary year for Koppers in 2020. \u2047 We look forward to providing more insight into what we expect in 2021 on our February call coming up in less than a month. \u2047 Until then, I'll update you briefly on a number of other things going on at Koppers before handing it over to Mike to review the quarterly results in more details. \u2047 Moving to Slide 9, currently, we have 20 employees or about 1% of our total employee population self-quarantining for the coronavirus. \u2047 To date, we have had 232 employees worldwide, or 11%, who'd have tested positive. \u2047 And on a cumulative basis, we've seen close to 2,000 occurrences of employees testing positive or having -- of employee testing positive or quarantining, many of them more than once. \u2047 Consistent with national worldwide trends, we have seen an increase in cases throughout the last quarter and early part of 2021. \u2047 And while we continually reinforce the importance of practicing safe behaviors and are diligent in ensuring the proper safety measures like thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting any affected areas, the virus has proven to be a formidable obstacle to overcome in our operating environment. \u2047 Face coverings are required at all North American facilities and we provided these to our employees. \u2047 Our strict protocols governing personal protection into processes such as social distancing and diligent hygiene have also continued and includes using rapid self-administered saliva testing kits at our locations in North America. \u2047 We also recently began using a pool-testing method to screen all U.S.-based plant employees on a periodic basis as that is the employee base where 99% of our infections have come from. \u2047 In the screenings done to date, we've identified multiple asymptomatic employees and we're able to mitigate the potential spread of infection at those plants by keeping the virus outside of our fence lines. \u2047 Given the importance of effectively addressing COVID, Koppers has established a new life-saving role that's designed to raise awareness of infection hazards, bind more discipline to our routines and identify job tasks that have higher risk. \u2047 For the higher-risk job tasks, we'll require more stringent standards of respiratory protection which include N95 masks and advanced level respirators. \u2047 Regarding our communications efforts, we began holding our quarterly all-employee meeting in three time zones to better accommodate our employees in the U.S. and Europe, and in Australia, New Zealand. \u2047 The new format has encouraged discussion of topics most relevant to each geographic region. \u2047 Beyond that, we continue to hold virtual chat with employees in our plants and those working remotely, and also I continue to provide updates and encouragement to our employees worldwide through weekly videos, which were also posted on Koppers' Facebook and LinkedIn pages. \u2047 Looking at our operations continuity on Slide 11, we see that all worldwide Koppers manufacturing facilities remain operational with no furloughs or layoffs. \u2047 Travel continues to be restricted to essential business only. \u2047 We continue to carefully evaluate potentially holding a limited number of in-person facility visits, but only if necessary in order to reinforce health and safety goals. \u2047 Our office employees are strongly encouraged to keep working remotely with a return to the office postponed until April 1st of '21 at the earliest. \u2047 Now, of course, anyone working on site is required to follow all face-covering and other COVID-prevention protocols. \u2047 And on the vaccines front, we do not plan to require employees to be vaccinated to enter our facilities but we are strongly encouraging it to the extent that we plan to offer financial incentives through our employee-wellness program to those that supply proof of their vaccination. \u2047 Getting as many of our employees through the vaccination process is the quickest way for us to move forward without the specter of COVID-19 and its effects hanging over us. \u2047 Now, as another example of technology enabling us to run our business even better, we recently implemented a fleet safety dashboard in order to improve the safety and efficiency of our trucking operations. \u2047 Also, we're deploying new visitor management system at our facilities to help with keeping our employees and visitor safe. \u2047 We also continue to leverage every available technology to conduct meetings, make virtual facility visits, conduct virtual training programs, and conduct virtual ISO audits. \u2047 Slide 13 illustrates our continuing efforts to engage employees in meaningful ways. \u2047 Three of our female members of Koppers' leadership council were featured in the first installment of an empowerment series for employees, which was held virtually in the fourth quarter. \u2047 As we hired our Chief Sustainability Officer, Stephanie Apostolou, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and Quynh McGuire, our Vice President of Investor Relations participated in a panel discussion that covered topics such as carving their path to success, discovering their individual leadership styles, building their support networks, and managing their work-life balance. \u2047 Hosted by LINKwomen, one of our employee resource groups, the event was well attended and will serve as a model for similar programs to be held in the future. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we launched our annual global employee engagement survey, which gives everyone the chance to provide me and our leadership team with open, honest, and confidential feedback about what it's like to work at Koppers and how we can further enhance the employee experience. \u2047 We've been parsing through the results, and we'll shortly be implementing certain changes to better address areas where we fall short. \u2047 It remains a core commitment to create positive change based on employee input. \u2047 We strive to differentiate Koppers as an employer of choice and to use that as a competitive advantage in an environment where talent is at a premium. \u2047 Slide 15 shows two tangible examples of our employees caring for the environment. \u2047 During our 2019 safety, health, and environmental conference, participants traveled to our Newsoms, Virginia facility to create floating wetlands or man-made rafts that float on the water surface and house native wetland plants, providing homes to beneficial water cleaning microorganisms. \u2047 A year later, our team checked in during the fourth quarter of 2020, and the wetlands are growing well to successfully do their job. \u2047 Our facility in Stickney, Illinois, employees recently planted hardwood to enhance soil quality and create a more attractive green space for the community at a neighboring terminal, where we began a phytoremediation project in 2019. \u2047 Photos show the new hardwoods, along with the growth of many other plants since the start of the project. \u2047 Going to Slide 17, here are some of the examples of how Koppers' teams are serving our neighbors. \u2047 For the fifth year, Koppers Railroad Structures participated in the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's virtual Light The Night event in Madison, Wisconsin, bringing its cumulative impact to more than $91,000 in donations. \u2047 Additionally, Vice President of Railroad Structures, Mike Tweet, a bone marrow recipient, has worked with the University of Wisconsin in Madison to support Be The Match, which brings donors and recipients together. \u2047 Our utility and industrial products group continued with deploying its storm response teams in August, restoring power to 25 million utility customers affected by devastating winds sweeping across Iowa. \u2047 In November, our UIP team again implemented its 24/7 storm recovery program to help those in Georgia, affected by Hurricane Zeta. \u2047 At roughly the same time, our UIP crews also responded to a major ice storm in Oklahoma, supplying more than 3,500 poles and crossties to aid in post-storm recovery. \u2047 The feedback that we've received from key municipal and utility customers has been uniformly positive and highly appreciative. \u2047 Over the holidays, at year-end, Koppers' employees across our worldwide footprint continue making a difference by reaching out to those in need, as shown on Slide 18. \u2047 Those at our Ashcroft, British Columbia facility donated 600 pounds of food to the Ashcroft community food bank, 150 pounds of household items to The Equality Project, and funds to the Jackson House Assisted Living facility. \u2047 Our Rock Hill employees donated more than 300 pounds of canned goods to their local food pantry and supported the local Toys for Tots campaign. \u2047 And at our Queen City facility, employees donated gently used clothing to a local shelter as part of clean out your closets for the homeless. \u2047 Our"], "gold_summary": ["expects to invest $105 million to $115 million in capital expenditures in 2021.
