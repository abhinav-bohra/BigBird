President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Sheehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Jim Snee will provide a review of the Company's current and future operating conditions, commentary regarding each segment's performance for the quarter and update on the impact to the company of the COVID-19 pandemic and a perspective on the balance of fiscal 2021. \u2047 Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results and commentary regarding the Company's current and future financial condition. \u2047 As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. \u2047 It will also be posted on our website and archived for one year. \u2047 Before we get started, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. \u2047 It can be accessed on our website. \u2047 As we approach the one-year mark of the pandemic, I want to express my gratitude to our plant professionals for their continued dedication, energy and focus. \u2047 They continue to be the true heroes of our company during this time. \u2047 On our last earnings call in November, we were witnessing an increase of COVID-19 cases in the United States. \u2047 Our number one priority has been to keep our team members safe, and we have been very focused on our best-in-class preventative measures and on educating our employees through our awareness campaign keep COVID out. \u2047 As the pandemic evolves and the vaccine becomes more widely available to our team members, we'll continue to keep the health and safety of our team members as the top priority. \u2047 We were among the first to offer a COVID pay program to allow those who are ill or had symptoms to stay home from work and still be paid. \u2047 Additionally, we paid $11 million in fiscal 2020 and unconditional bonuses to our team members to provide further financial security. \u2047 Our program has resulted in minimizing the spread of COVID in our workplaces and our communities. \u2047 Recently, we have been encouraged to see cases decline and the number of team members on our COVID pay program drastically decrease. \u2047 This gives us increased optimism as we head into the second quarter. \u2047 We were pleased to announce the entry into a definitive agreement to acquire the Planters business last Thursday. \u2047 We have many leading brands that Hormel and the acquisition of the Planters snack nut business will be an excellent addition to our Company. \u2047 Over the past 10-years, we have made numerous acquisition, all of which are meeting our strategic objectives. \u2047 The performances of MegaMex, Wholly, SKIPPY, Applegate, Justin's, Ceratti, Fontanini, Columbus and Sadlers give us a high level of confidence in our ability to successfully integrate, operate and grow the Planters business. \u2047 The acquisition of Planters is the perfect strategic fit. \u2047 The addition of this iconic brand in high-margin business continues our evolution as a global branded food company, moving us further away from a commodity-oriented meat-centric company. \u2047 As one of our biggest brands, we will give it a high level of focus and attention. \u2047 Our core competency and brand stewardship will be key to our success and unlocking the power of the Planters brands. \u2047 We know how to manage brands and Planters is right in our sweet spot as we know Planters is more than simply peanuts in the jar. \u2047 Planters also perfectly complements, enhances and expands our existing snacking business. \u2047 Joining brands like Hormel Gatherings, Columbus, Wholly and Herdez. \u2047 There are numerous opportunities to leverage the consumer insights from both portfolios to drive further innovation and improve growth for our entire snacking business. \u2047 The Planters business gives us another iconic brand to grow and increases our scale in key areas such as center store and convenience stores. \u2047 Integration into our direct sales force is a high priority and we know there are immediate opportunities to improve distribution and drive sales growth. \u2047 Another priority for us is to integrate the business into our One Supply Chain and Project Orion platforms. \u2047 We expect synergies from this integration for the Planters business and for our existing business. \u2047 There is a lot to love about this acquisition and I'm excited for the transaction to close, so we can begin to give the Planters business the attention and focus it needs to grow. \u2047 Now turning to our first quarter. \u2047 Our team generated strong top line growth with sales increasing 3% to a record $2.5 billion all four segments delivered sales growth and achievement that hasn't been accomplished since 2016. \u2047 Incremental supply chain costs related to COVID-19 of $15 million were the primary reason for a $13 million decline in pre-tax earnings. \u2047 Net earnings and diluted earnings per share declined 9%, due primarily to incremental supply chain costs and higher tax expense. \u2047 As in prior quarters, we continue to strike a balance between the consumer demand we are seeing and our supply chains ability to meet that demand. \u2047 We increased production levels this quarter through a combination of improving efficiencies; bringing on new capacity and further leveraging our strategic supply chain partners. \u2047 We expect this steady improvement to continue throughout the year, we have been successful in a number of critical categories and we will continue to make progress across the portfolio. \u2047 Our retail business continued to perform extremely well with sales increasing 13% for the quarter. \u2047 Brands such as SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel chili, Hormel Black Label, Applegate, Hormel pepperoni, Lloyd Hormel fully cooked entrees and Justin's all delivered very strong growth. \u2047 Most encouraging was the sales growth we saw from the Jennie-O brand every major retail category, including Jennie-O lean ground, turkey burgers, Oven Ready items, Bacon and marinated meats grew. \u2047 The Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with consumers and the efforts we have made on gaining back customer distribution are paying off. \u2047 Our e-commerce business continues to be a bright spot as it almost doubled in the last 12-weeks according to IRI. \u2047 We grew share in several key categories and have a high level of momentum in online grocery pickup, delivery and direct-to-consumer. \u2047 Our deli channel sales increased 7% this quarter; Columbus branded products led the way with exceptional growth from grab-and-go items. \u2047 The opening of our new plant in Omaha this quarter, which produces Columbus charcuterie products will provide much needed capacity for this business. \u2047 While the Columbus brand was the clear leader for us this quarter in the deli, our team generated growth in every deli segment they compete in, including grab-and-go, prepared foods, behind-the-glass and fresh sliced deli meats. \u2047 Our party tray business also grew volume in sales over the holiday season, despite fewer group gatherings, a testament to our team's ability to keep this brand relevance. \u2047 We saw a positive signs of recovery in foodservice this quarter even as the business declined 17%, compared to last year, due to the continued impacts of the pandemic on the industry. \u2047 We continue to see strength in our business with an important segments such as Pizzeria, QSRs and convenience stores. \u2047 Our direct sales force also made excellent progress pivoting to high growth areas, such as commissary's and ghost kitchens as they secured new distribution with both distributors and operators. \u2047 Turning to the segments. \u2047 Grocery Products delivered very impressive results this quarter. \u2047 We saw top line strength across many of our brands, including SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Compleats and Herdez, which led to volume increases of 4% and the sales increases of 7%. \u2047 We implemented a price increase for our SKIPPY business this quarter, once again demonstrating our ability to price in our categories. \u2047 We are also encouraged with the performance of our recent innovative new items, including SKIPPY Squeeze, SKIPPY No Sugar and SKIPPY with added protein spreads. \u2047 Our MegaMex joint venture had a strong performance this quarter as well, but equity and earnings increasing by 31%. \u2047 This growth was led by our retail brands, such as Wholly, Herdez, CHI-CHI'S and La Victoria. \u2047 In addition to the MegaMex results, the 35% increase in segment profit was driven by higher sales and a favorable mix. \u2047 Refrigerated Foods volume declined 2% and sales increased 1%. \u2047 Our retail and deli teams overcame steep year-over-year declines in our foodservice business to deliver growth for our value-added business. \u2047 Applegate had a particularly strong quarter with growth fueled by both category momentum and share gains across core categories such as Frozen Branded Chicken, Breakfast Sausage, Bacon and Hot Dogs. \u2047 I continue to be optimistic about the momentum we are building in the Applegate business. \u2047 We also delivered excellent results in our Hormel pepperoni business both in foodservice and retail. \u2047 Our teams continue to optimize the brand by focusing on our core products in the category and simultaneously leaning into our new Cup N' Crisp innovation. \u2047 We plan to maintain our advertising efforts for Hormel pepperoni to ensure we retain the households we gained during the initial pandemic buying. \u2047 Refrigerated food segment profit declined by 16%, due to lower foodservice sales, a significant decline in commodity, profitability and increased supply chain expenses due to COVID-19, profitability was also impacted by one-time start-up expenses related to our new plant in Omaha. \u2047 Jennie-O volume decreased 2% and the sales increased 1%. \u2047 We saw exceptionally strong retail and whole bird sales, which overcame significant declines in the foodservice and commodity. \u2047 Our retail business grew double-digits this quarter with growth coming from almost every category in which we compete. \u2047 We have taken price increases across our portfolio and expect those to be effective late in the second quarter. \u2047 Whole bird volumes increased by strong double-digits, due to a very positive holiday season. \u2047 Our foodservice business was impacted by lower K through 12 and college and university business in addition to continued weakness in the foodservice industry. \u2047 Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 30%, lower foodservice sales increased supply chain costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher freight expenses were key drivers to the lower profitability. \u2047 Grain prices increased significantly during the quarter, but only had a modest effect on earnings. \u2047 We expect the primary impact of higher grain prices to affect the coming quarters. \u2047 In addition the pricing action, we have taken additional actions to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs. \u2047 International volume decreased 5%, sales increased 13% and segment profit increased 61%. \u2047 Once again the strong sales and earnings performance was led by our retail and foodservice business in China. \u2047 SPAM, SKIPPY and beef jerky were all key drivers to growth in China, we remain very positive about the short and long-term prospects of our China business. \u2047 We also saw a strong branded exports for brands like SKIPPY and SPAM. \u2047 Similar to prior quarters, our affiliated businesses in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe continue to show high levels of growth. \u2047 Looking to the balance of the year, I'm increasingly optimistic about delivering sales and earnings growth. \u2047 As such we are establishing fiscal 2021 guidance for the full-year at $1.70 to $1.82 per share. \u2047 As a reminder this guidance range does not include the impact of the acquisition of Planters. \u2047 Similar to prior quarters, we believe there are three key drivers to our near-term and long-term performance. \u2047 Retail dynamics, the recovery in the foodservice industry and the performance of our supply chain. \u2047 Our retail deli and International teams need to maintain their momentum and outperform their respective categories. \u2047 Our brands continue to gain new households and our repeat rates remain very strong. \u2047 The depth of repeat, those consumers purchasing our brands multiple times is incredibly positive, but almost all new buyers for our brands making two or more repeat purchases during the first quarter. \u2047 As a whole, our brands continue to make household penetration gains with brands like Herdez, La Victoria and Columbus increasing household penetration by over 20%. \u2047 For the foodservice channel, we are optimistic about our foodservice recovery and confident in our ability to gain share during the recovery. \u2047 During the pandemic operators have been looking for products to simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item. \u2047 Our direct sales force continues to meet their needs with products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoke barbecue and Hormel, Bacon 1. \u2047 The recent trends we are seeing in our foodservice businesses are positive. \u2047 We have been able to react quickly to increase demand as cities and states have these dining restrictions, allowing patrons to return to their favorite restaurants. \u2047 We also anticipate our non-commercial business such as K through 12 schools, colleges and universities and healthcare to recover as the pandemic subsides. \u2047 The most encouraging signs we are seeing are in our supply chain. \u2047 We made excellent progress on increasing capacity to meet the high levels of demand from our customers. \u2047 Steady week-over-week improvements, lower levels of absenteeism, new capacity and a continued vaccine rollout are all reasons we have a positive outlook. \u2047 Our supply chain team hit two major milestones this quarter, with the opening of our new dry sausage production facility in Omaha, Nebraska and the opening of our pizza toppings expansion at Burke. \u2047 Both projects were on time and on budget, which is truly amazing considering both projects were constructed primarily during the pandemic. \u2047 Our plant teams have made progress on labor availability and in almost every location, our labor situation has improved. \u2047 We expect that trend to continue into the second quarter and beyond, as the vaccine becomes widely available for our team members. \u2047 We now have a higher level of visibility into the coming quarters and remain confident in our team's ability to deliver our sales and earnings guidance this year. \u2047 Record sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 3%. \u2047 COVID-related direct expenses of $15 million were the primary driver to pre-tax earnings declining $13 million or 5%. \u2047 Absent the COVID expenses pre-tax earnings would have increased; total COVID expenses have started to decline from the prior quarterly run rate of $20 million. \u2047 This was driven by higher volumes through our production facilities and improved efficiencies in our logistics network. \u2047 Earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.41, compared to $0.45 last year. \u2047 On an after-tax basis, first quarter results reflected approximately $0.04 per share in incremental COVID-related costs and higher tax expense. \u2047
