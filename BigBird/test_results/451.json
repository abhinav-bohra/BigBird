{"article": ["All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, president and chief executive officer of Florida Power and Light Company. \u2047 As a reminder, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power and Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. \u2047 Gulf Power continued as a separate reportable segment within Florida Power and Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. \u2047 Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had an outstanding year in 2021 and are well positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunities that lie ahead. \u2047 NextEra Energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally and we executed the largest capital program in our history. \u2047 Continuing our long track record of delivering value for shareholders, NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.55, up more than 10% from 2020. \u2047 Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted earnings per share of approximately 9%, which is the highest among all top 10 U.S. power companies who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of roughly 3% over the same period. \u2047 Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. \u2047 In 2021, we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index in terms of total shareholder return on a three, five, 10 and 15-year basis. \u2047 Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and quadrupled the average total shareholder return of the index. \u2047 Over the same period, we've outperformed 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. \u2047 We are proud of our long-term track record of providing growth and value creation opportunities for our shareholders and we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years. \u2047 At FPL, net income increased nearly 11% year over year while continuing to deliver on its commitment to making smart, long-term investments in innovative technology, clean energy and strengthening our electric grid for the benefit of our customers. \u2047 We were pleased the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously approved the settlement agreement in October, an agreement, which we believe is a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case. \u2047 while keeping FPL's typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through the end of 2025. \u2047 For customers in Northwest Florida, typical customer bills are projected to decline over the next four years. \u2047 Among the long-term infrastructure investments anticipated in the new agreement, new solar generation is expected to grow through the expanded SolarTogether community solar program which is expected to more than double over the next four years as well as through new base rate solar generation, including the nearly 1,800 megawatts to be recovered under solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA upon reaching commercial operations in 2024 and 2025. \u2047 In total, our current solar build-out expectations are for approximately 4,800 megawatts of new solar over the term of the settlement agreement. \u2047 In early 2019, FPL announced its groundbreaking role to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030. \u2047 With the anticipated solar additions approved under the settlement agreement, I am pleased to announce that we now expect to reach this milestone by 2025, five years earlier than previously anticipated. \u2047 Including the solar additions anticipated through 2025, this ambitious 30 by 30 initiative is expected to have generated approximately $2.5 billion in fuel cost savings for customers and created more than 20,000 construction jobs while supporting the Florida economy with more than $700 million in property taxes over the life of the assets. \u2047 During 2021, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing another 671 megawatts of cost-effective solar and service, completing the first roughly 1,500 megawatt phase of our SolarTogether community solar program. \u2047 Additionally, last month, we commissioned the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will allow our customers to benefit from low-cost solar energy even during times when the sun is not shining. \u2047 FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2021. \u2047 And FPL was recognized for the sixth time in seven years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. \u2047 Moreover, FPL was ranked No. \u2047 1 in both residential and business customer satisfaction in the Southern U.S. among large electric providers by J.D. Power in 2021 and we are completely committed to continuing to provide clean, affordable and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. \u2047 energy resources also had a terrific year in 2021, delivering adjusted earnings growth of 13% versus the prior year. \u2047 The team also had an outstanding record year of renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 7,200 megawatts to our backlog during the year as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring in our nation's generation fleet. \u2047 Our backlog additions have grown more than 20% compound annual growth rate since 2017 and we are well on our way to meeting our current development expectations for new signed contracts. \u2047 With the significant additions to our backlog of signed contracts over the last year, we've now signed nearly 80% of the megawatts needed to realize in the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range, with significant time remaining to sign additional power purchase agreements. \u2047 Our supply chain and engineering and construction teams also continued to execute in 2021, commissioning approximately 3,800 megawatts of new wind and wind repowering, solar and storage projects. \u2047 Over the past two years, energy resources has constructed more than 9,500 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of its execution expertise, even in the midst of a global pandemic and industrywide supply chain disruptions. \u2047 Finally, during 2021, NextEra energy transmission its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. \u2047 During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution by increasing net income by nearly 20% over its previous earnings contribution record in 2020. \u2047 to support this transition to a low-cost, low-carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. \u2047 We anticipate that NextEra energy transmission will continue to capitalize on the growing opportunity set to both deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. \u2047 The tremendous execution in both the major businesses in recent years, including '21, gives us great visibility to the longer-term outlook of NextEra Energy. \u2047 Let me start with our opportunity set, which I would not trade with anyone in our industry. \u2047 At Florida Power and Light, the settlement agreement allows us to focus on operating the business efficiently, reliably and affordably for the benefit of our customers. \u2047 Under the new agreement, we expect our average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be between 8% and 9% over the four-year term through 2025. \u2047 When you put it all together, low bills, best-in-class reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile are what helped FPL provide what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the nation. \u2047 At energy resources, our outlook for new renewables and storage development remains as strong as ever and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old inefficient forms of generation and into clean, reliable, low-cost renewables and storage. \u2047 We believe that the rapidly accelerating trend toward electrification and decarbonization of a broad range of sectors across the U.S. economy has significantly increased the total addressable market for new renewables and storage, even beyond our expectations just a few years ago and is now measured in trillions of dollars of capital investment opportunity in the coming decades. \u2047 We believe that energy resources is uniquely positioned to advance its market leadership position in this environment. \u2047 We have been in the renewables business for more than 30 years and have the experience, resources, balance sheet, talent and advanced data capabilities necessary to execute complex renewable energy generation and storage integration projects at scale. \u2047 We believe we have an excellent opportunity set for continued growth ahead of us at energy resources and we will further discuss our long-term plans for deploying renewables at both energy resources and Florida Power and Light and the associated impact to our overall emissions profile and future goals at our upcoming investor conference, which we plan to hold on June 14 in New York City. \u2047 With the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both Florida Power and Light and NextEra energy resources, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2022 and 2023 and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. \u2047 For 2022, we are now expecting our adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85, up from our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75. \u2047 For years 23 through 25, we expect to grow our adjusted earnings per share by roughly 6% to 8% per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share. \u2047 For 2023, this translates to a new range of $2.93 to $3.08, up from our prior range of $2.77 to $297 million. \u2047 Our new adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2024 are $3.13 to $3.33. \u2047 And for 2025 are $3.35 to $3.60. \u2047 As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. \u2047 In summary, we continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. \u2047 Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in each of 2022, '23, '24 and 2025, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. \u2047 Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 30% in 2021, bringing its two-year total unitholder return up to more than 72% and further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO in 2014. \u2047 For 2021, the NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by 15% year over year and has now grown its distributions per unit by nearly 280% since the IPO. \u2047 NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 80% as of year-end 2021. \u2047 NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year of execution in '21 and we are increasing our year-end 2021 financial expectations to reflect this better-than-expected growth execution. \u2047 NextEra Energy Partners delivered year-end run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in excess of our prior expectations, including delivering more than 13% year-over-year growth in run rate cash available for distribution at the midpoints. \u2047 This execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2021. \u2047 During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,900 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from energy resources. \u2047 In addition, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed two acquisitions of renewable energy assets from third parties, adding nearly 500 megawatts of operating wind projects to its portfolio. \u2047 These transactions demonstrate NextEra Energy's ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra energy resources, low-cost sources of capital and our strong industry relationships to be successful in third-party acquisitions. \u2047 The combination of a growing portfolio at energy resources and a growing set of opportunities to acquire renewables from third parties as well as significant organic growth opportunities, further supports the partnership's long-term growth visibility. \u2047 NextEra Energy Partners also continued to demonstrate its ability to access attractive sources of capital to finance its growth investments, including executing on the lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in its history. \u2047 The roughly $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing carries a low implied cash coupon to the investor and partially funded NextEra Energy Partners acquisition of a 50% interest in a renewables portfolio, consisting of approximately 2,520 megawatts of newly constructed or in construction renewables projects and approximately 115 megawatts of integrated battery storage. \u2047 NextEra Energy Partners was able to demonstrate the benefits to LP unitholders of the convertible equity portfolio financing structure during the fourth quarter when the partnership exercised its right to purchase 100% of the outstanding minority equity interests in the portfolio of wind and solar assets, supporting its 2018 convertible equity portfolio financing. \u2047 Relative to issuing the same amount of common equity in 2018 to fund our growth needs. \u2047 This financing allowed us to reduce unit issuance by more than 50% and save more than $140 million or roughly 75% in nominal cash costs while retaining the more than 80% increase in the net unit price over the last three years. \u2047 NextEra Energy Partners public float has increased approximately 50% since 2019. \u2047 We believe our strategy of using low-cost convertible equity products to efficiently layer in common equity over time has created significant value for existing LP unitholders. \u2047 I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy's partners clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers LP unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. \u2047 As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years. \u2047 These changes are part of a long-term succession process undertaken by the board and me over the better part of the last six years. \u2047 Effective March 1, John Ketchum will price me as president and CEO of NextEra Energy. \u2047 Rebecca will succeed John as president and CEO of NextEra energy resources. \u2047 Kirk Crews, currently vice president, business management for NextEra energy resources will succeed Rebecca as executive vice president and chief financial officer of NextEra Energy. \u2047 John, Rebecca and Kirk will also be appointed to the respective roles at NextEra Energy Partners. \u2047 In addition, Eric Silagy, president and chief executive officer of Florida Power and Light Company has been named chairman and chief executive officer of Florida Power and Light. \u2047 It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CEO for nearly 10 years. \u2047 I'm as excited as I've ever been about the future prospects of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. \u2047 A big part of a CEO's legacy is the new leader in the next-generation leadership team that follows. \u2047 And I couldn't be more thrilled about turning over the CEO role of this great company to John. \u2047 I know"], "gold_summary": ["nextera energy partners lp qtrly loss per common unit attributable to nextera energy partners, lp assuming
