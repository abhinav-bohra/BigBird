{"article": ["I would now like to turn the conference call over to Stephan. \u2047 I hope that you are doing well. \u2047 I would like to discuss a few highlights as mentioned on Slide three. \u2047 In summary, sales increased in each of our reporting segments with currency-related tailwinds adding to the core growth. \u2047 The right breadth of our portfolio of solutions and services continues to be a key strength of Aptar as we generated growth in each segment and double-digit growth overall for the company. \u2047 Bob will speak in more detail on sales by market when he gives his update. \u2047 Similar to the first quarter, growth of our Pharma segment was driven by strong demand for elastomeric components for injectable drugs and exit Material Solutions, which offset declines in sales to the prescription and consumer healthcare markets, which continue to be impacted by customers drawing down inventory levels in key categories. \u2047 Our Beauty + Home segment reported solid growth in the beauty and home care markets, the former being mostly on easier comparison to the depressed second quarter of 2020 although with some initial signs of recovery. \u2047 Sales to the personal care market were slightly below the prior year's strong performance as hand sanitizer demand is normalizing. \u2047 Approximately 75% of the growth came from increased volumes. \u2047 In our Food + Beverage segment, top line growth was strong across each market segment with about 60% of the growth coming from price adjustments related to the passing through of higher resin costs. \u2047 It continues to be a very challenging input cost environment, and we are in the process of passing through higher input costs to our customers. \u2047 Our overall margin was also affected by the mix of sales within our Pharma segment, favoring some of our lower-margin businesses in pharma. \u2047 We also remain active on the M&A front making several strategic investments. \u2047 During the quarter, we announced that we were in the process to acquire the outstanding shares of Voluntis, a pioneer in digital therapeutics. \u2047 This is a significant step in building our foundation in the fast-growing digital healthcare space. \u2047 If we have learned anything from the pandemic, it is that advancements in healthcare are rapidly accelerating. \u2047 And things like remote patient engagement and patient monitoring, whether for clinical trials or real-world treatment, will be a big part of each of our futures. \u2047 Just this week, we announced another pharma transaction. \u2047 We have entered into an agreement to acquire 80% of Weihai Hengyu Medical Products, a leading manufacturer of elastomer components for injection devices in China. \u2047 This investment gives us immediate local and regional supply capabilities in the critical and growing injectable space. \u2047 Also, subsequent to the quarter, we announced the collaboration with a Chinese skin care company called YAP to bring new skin care solutions to the market. \u2047 We look forward to leveraging YAP's expansive market insight database focused on specific consumer skin care needs and skin care profiles, and we will use YAP's in-depth experience and customized turnkey solutions as well as online product distribution and promotion. \u2047 On the sustainability front, we have been active in forming strategic partnerships to further our progress toward a more circular economy where plastic can be recycled and reused. \u2047 To that end, we have formed a partnership and are serving as a strategic advisor to a company called Repo to offer a reusable water bottle that uses technology to help people stay high graded while helping to collect castaway plastic bottles. \u2047 Now on Slide four, I would like to speak to a few environment, social and governance, or ESG updates. \u2047 As previously announced, 3BL Media evaluated the 1,000 largest public U.S. companies on ESG performance, and Aptar is honored to be named among the top 50 companies who are leading in corporate citizenship. \u2047 We also announced the launch of our 2020 Sustainability Report, which highlights again our extensive sustainability initiatives that have been implemented across our global operations, and we invite you to read the report on our website. \u2047 Our first comprehensive sustainability report was for the year 2014. \u2047 So our experience in engagement is built on deep expertise and a long track record. \u2047 Canvas is a highly accomplished business leader with over 30 years of experience developing and marketing products for the healthcare, cosmetics, food and beverage industries. \u2047 And she has held leadership positions with Amway, Loreal, Coca-Cola and Procter and Gamble, among others. \u2047 Our directors provide valuable guidance and keen oversight based on their first-hand operating experience in the end market and geographic regions in which we operate as well as functional expertise and multicultural insights. \u2047 Candace is a valuable addition to Aptar's Board with deep contemporary knowledge of our markets, including having spent a significant time in China. \u2047 Turning now to Slide five, in new product and technology launches. \u2047 I would like to briefly comment on several product introductions that will highlight the breadth of our offerings. \u2047 In pharma, our elastomer softwares used with injection systems continue to play an important role in the COVID-19 vaccine distributions worldwide, including a vaccine approved in Latin America. \u2047 We're also supplying stockers for several animal vaccines in Mexico. \u2047 In the prescription drug market, the central nervous system pipeline is active, and we have several customers making progress with nasal delivery of a variety of medicines in the area of opioid overdose antidote, epinephrine medicines to treat suicidal tendencies. \u2047 In Consumer Healthcare, our pressure-free ophthalmic squeeze dispenser is the delivery device for a new over-the-counter iLubricant by Bausch and Lomb Biotrue brand in the U.S. In Beauty + Home, we recently announced a strategic sustainable dispensing system, our first fully recyclable non-material dispenser pump for the beauty and personal care products called Future. \u2047 Because the Future pump is made only from polyethylene, it also aligns with the most common materials used to make the bottles, polyethylene and polyester, or PET. \u2047 Therefore, the complete packaging, including pump and bottle, are more easily recycled. \u2047 We also supplied our prestige fragrance pump for a new Tom Ford fragrance and our dispensing closure for Dollar Shave Club's New shampoo and conditioner line, most recently launched in the U.S. Also in the U.S., our airless pump is the dispensing solution for Coty's Cover Girl + Olay brand color cosmetics product called Eye Rehab. \u2047 Finally, in the home care market, our closure with SimpliSqueeze valve is featured on the NUK dish care product in Europe. \u2047 In Food + Beverage, we received critical guidance recognition from the Association of Plastic Recyclers for our SimpliCycle recyclable valve technology. \u2047 Or SimpliCycle valve is made from a low-density materials that allows the valve to float so it is easily separated from the polyester stream and then ultimately recycled twisted polypropylene or polyethylene olefin stream. \u2047 In the food market, our custom closures are featured on a limited additional line of mash-up sauces, including hot sales coupled with ranch and tartar sauce combined with ketchup by KraftHeinz in Canada. \u2047 Nestle has also launched a new range of condiments with flavors from the Middle East called Mezeast, which feature our food closures. \u2047 Turning to the beverage market. \u2047 Our closure with SimpliSqueeze valve is the dispensing solution for a new concentrate product in Germany called Creme de la Cream Concentrates by ALDI. \u2047 Starting with Slide six. \u2047 As Stephan mentioned, we had a strong top line performance in the quarter, and I will walk through some of the market growth in a few minutes. \u2047 Turning to Slide seven. \u2047 Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.91 per share on a comparable basis with the prior year and when neutralizing currency effects. \u2047 Aptar's adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $148 million compared to the prior year, and this included the negative impact of the shift in business across our markets as well as a net negative inflation impact of approximately $9 million. \u2047 Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin would have been approximately 180 basis points higher without the net negative inflation effect and the margin compression impact from passing on the higher costs. \u2047 Slide eight and nine cover our year-to-date performance and show the 5% core sales growth and our adjusted earnings per share which were $2.01, up 10% compared to the $1.83 a year ago, including comparable exchange rates. \u2047 Briefly summarizing our segment results, our Pharma business performance was mixed across the different divisions with total segment core sales growth of 2%. \u2047 Pharma had an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 33%, which was reflective of the mix of business across the different markets compared to the previous year. \u2047 Additionally, Pharma's margin was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to net negative inflation costs in the quarter of approximately $2 million. \u2047 Looking at sales growth by market compared to the prior year. \u2047 Core sales to the prescription market decreased 7%, and core sales to the consumer healthcare market decreased 1% as certain pharma customers in these markets continue to draw down inventory levels as treatment for allergic rhinitis and cough and cold are impacted by low levels of patient consumption and fewer overall noncritical doctor appointments. \u2047 It was another strong quarter for components used for injectable medicines and our active material solutions. \u2047 Core sales to the injectables market increased 14%, and half of the growth was related to vaccine administration, of which the majority was for COVID-19 vaccines. \u2047 Core sales of our active material science solutions increased 20%, primarily due to increased sales of our protective packaging solutions for probiotic products and COVID-19 diagnostic test solutions. \u2047 Turning to our Beauty + Home segment. \u2047 core sales increased 13% over the prior year second quarter, which is the most difficult period during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Approximately 75% of the growth came from increased volumes. \u2047 This segment's adjusted EBITDA margin was 11% in the quarter and was negatively impacted by the timing of passing through increased resin and other raw material costs as well as other inflationary costs, which had negatively affected adjusted EBITDA by roughly $5 million. \u2047 Had we not had this net negative inflation impact and we did not have the margin compression effect of passing through the higher costs, EBITDA margins would have been approximately 180 basis points higher. \u2047 Looking at sales growth by market on a core basis. \u2047 Core sales to the beauty market increased 28% due to higher consumer demand for fragrances and facial skin care products. \u2047 Core sales to the personal care market decreased 1% as higher sales to the hair care and sun care markets were offset by declines in personal cleansing as hand sanitizer demand normalizes. \u2047 Core sales to the home care market increased 26% on strong demand for a variety of applications and increased custom tooling sales. \u2047 Turning to our Food + Beverage segment, which had another solid performance, core sales increased 23%. \u2047 Approximately 60% of the core sales increase is due to passing through higher resin and other input costs. \u2047 The segment had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16% and was negatively impacted by net inflationary cost increases of approximately $2 million. \u2047 Had we not had this net negative inflation impact and we did not have the margin compression effect of passing through higher costs, EBITDA margins would have been approximately 360 basis points higher. \u2047 Looking at each market, core sales to the food market increased 21% as volume rose on increased demand for specialty food dispensing closures as consumers continue to cook at home. \u2047 Core sales to the beverage market increased 26% as we realized some recovery over a very low prior year second quarter. \u2047 Moving now to Slide 10, which summarizes our outlook for the third quarter. \u2047 I'd like to take a minute to remind everyone that in the prior year third quarter, we had a progresssignificant amount of cost and tooling sales that caused an atypical jump in our sales last year in our Active Material Solutions Group, where we were up over 50% in year-over-year top line growth. \u2047 As Stephan mentioned, while we expect the second half to continue to show signs of recovery, our expectation is now for a stronger recovery toward the end of the year. \u2047 There's still a lot of uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery, and many of our customers remain cautious. \u2047 We don't yet see a significant change in the prescription drug market in the third quarter but are anticipating an improvement in the fourth. \u2047 We expect our third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding any restructuring expenses, acquisition costs and changes in the fair value of equity investments, to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.98 per share. \u2047 The estimated tax rate range for the third quarter is 28% to 30%. \u2047 While we don't give guidance beyond the coming quarter earnings per share range, we have mentioned our optimism around the fourth quarter, and that would imply that our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share range should be above the third quarter, nearer to the current published consensus of equity research analysts. \u2047 In closing, we continue to have a strong balance sheet with a leverage ratio of approximately 1.5. \u2047 On a gross basis, debt to capital was approximately 36%. \u2047 While on a net basis, it was approximately 29%. \u2047 In addition, we continue to invest in innovative growth projects, and we are confirming our forecasted range of capital expenditures for the year at a range of $300 million to $330 million. \u2047 At this time, Stephan will provide a few closing comments before we move to Q&A. \u2047 In closing, on Slide 11, I'm very proud of our people and the work we have accomplished through the first half of the year amid these unprecedented times. \u2047 As certain economies begin to reopen, we expect the recovery in our beauty, beverage and prescription pharma business to gradually progress. \u2047 However, this recovery is likely to occur at a measured pace given the uncertainties around the COVID-19 variants and very limited intercontinental and intra-Asian travel. \u2047 We anticipate a stronger performance toward the end of the year. \u2047 As Bob pointed out, our fourth quarter should be stronger than our third, despite the fact that certain inflationary costs will remain a headwind, especially labor and likely transportation. \u2047 To mitigate those effects, we aim to implement further price adjustments where necessary to pass on these costs. \u2047 As we look out further, vaccine distributions will eventually be more widespread and successful, and life will eventually return to more normal experiences, with more robust social activities and international travel. \u2047 Our business is built for the long haul. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, because of our breadth across attractive markets, we are able to generate growth even when conditions are not always ordinary in each market. \u2047 We will continue to focus on sustainable growth and returns across all areas"], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted earnings per
