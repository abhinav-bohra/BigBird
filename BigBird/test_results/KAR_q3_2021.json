{"article": ["Today, we'll discuss the financial performance of KAR Global for the quarter ended September 30th 2021. \u2047 After concluding our commentary, we will take questions from participants. \u2047 Let me also mention that throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 I'll provide an update on the commercial seller volumes and what we expect to see between now and the end of next year. \u2047 I'll also provide updates on the continued growth in our dealer-to-dealer business with a focus on our digital dealer-to-dealer businesses, BacklotCars and TradeRev. \u2047 I'll provide an update on our acquisition of Carwave and the solid performance of our finance business, AFC. \u2047 And I'll close out with some updates relating to our cost structure. \u2047 So, I'd like to start with the third quarter. \u2047 And there is no question but that the third quarter was a challenging quarter, and the challenges were volume related and principally tied to the commercial seller category, specifically to off-lease vehicles. \u2047 These industrywide volume challenges are tied to the disruption of new vehicle production, and I spoke to these dynamics in detail at our Analyst Day event back in September. \u2047 However, I will say that the situation remains largely as I described at that time. \u2047 So in the third quarter, despite operating in an environment of very constrained vehicle supply from commercial sellers, we achieved the following results. \u2047 For KAR overall, we generated $535 million in revenue, which was a decline of 10% from Q3 of last year. \u2047 We generated a total gross profit of $222 million, representing 50.1% of revenue, excluding purchased vehicles. \u2047 We generated $96.6 million in adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 Cash generated from operations for the quarter was $57 million. \u2047 Within the ADESA segment, we facilitated the sale of 586,000 vehicles, representing over $9 billion in gross auction proceeds. \u2047 Now, these volumes are down 33% versus Q3 of last year. \u2047 Within that, our total commercial volume was down by 51% versus Q3 of last year and our total dealer consigned volume actually increased by 20%. \u2047 51% of our sales in the third quarter was from off-premise locations, and this is similar to our experience in the first half of this year. \u2047 We sold 118,000 vehicles on the TradeRev and BacklotCars platforms on a combined basis. \u2047 We also set new records in terms of total active sellers and total active buyers on these digital dealer-to-dealer platforms in both the U.S. and Canada in the third quarter. \u2047 We generated $274 in gross profit per vehicle sold in the ADESA segment. \u2047 This was driven in part by strong auction revenue per vehicle sold and is higher than the gross profit per vehicle generated in the first half of this year and 10% greater than the same statistic from Q3 of last year. \u2047 SG&A for KAR overall was $134 million for the quarter and SG&A for the ADESA segment was $126 million and that was down $14 million from Q1 of this year. \u2047 I continue to be pleased with the performance of our AFC business segment. \u2047 AFC had 351,000 loan transactions in the quarter. \u2047 This was an increase of 8% versus the same quarter last year and it was in line with the levels that we'd expect. \u2047 Revenue per loan transaction was also higher, 20% higher than Q3 of last year, at $215 for the quarter. \u2047 Key drivers of this were higher vehicle values and lower credit losses. \u2047 AFC continues to experience lower-than-normal levels of risk, driven by the current market conditions combined with strong operations. \u2047 AFC continues to grow its volume of business, as well as reengineered business processes to have a more efficient service delivery. \u2047 And for all those reasons, I expect to see continued strong performance from AFC, given the current environment. \u2047 So, I'd like to speak for a few moments about the supply dynamics of used vehicles within our marketplaces, particularly supply from commercial sellers. \u2047 So, as I see it, our challenges in the quarter were tied to the lack of commercial seller volumes across our marketplaces. \u2047 As I mentioned, commercial seller volumes were down by 51% versus the same quarter last year. \u2047 In our last earnings call and subsequently in our Analyst Day, I went into quite a lot of detail on the drivers of commercial vehicle supply within our industry. \u2047 My fundamental assessment has not changed. \u2047 I do believe that we're at the bottom in terms of the disruption with the supply of off-lease vehicles and rental vehicles at physical auctions, being very close to zero in both categories. \u2047 Most meaningful to KAR is the disruption in the off-lease volumes, which historically have represented approximately 60% of our total commercial seller volumes. \u2047 Now, volumes of repossessed vehicles also remain below normal. \u2047 I would say that repossession volumes are relatively stable at about 70% of normal levels right now. \u2047 And our analysis of the quarter's results indicate that we have maintained our market share with commercial sellers in the quarter. \u2047 So while we may be at the bottom, I still believe we should expect to remain here for some time. \u2047 In order for the volumes in our marketplaces to increase, we need to see an increase in new vehicle production, sufficient to reduce the very high used vehicle values and allow more off-lease vehicles to flow into the wholesale channel. \u2047 In our Analyst Day, we said that we expected new vehicle production to start to improve toward the end of the first half of next year and to continue to improve in the second half, but that we expected it to remain below normal throughout 2022. \u2047 Based on our continued analysis, as well as our ongoing conversations with customers, that assessment has not changed. \u2047 What that implies for our business is that we expect the current commercial seller volume constraints to continue through the first half of next year and we expect to see a small improvement in the second half. \u2047 We expect to see an acceleration in the volume recovery in 2023 and beyond. \u2047 So now, I'd like to provide an update on our progress in the dealer-to-dealer vehicle category. \u2047 So first of all, if we look at our total dealer consignment volumes at KAR, and by which I mean digital and physical combined, we sold 274,000 dealer consigned vehicles in the third quarter. \u2047 That represented an increase of 20% compared to KAR's total dealer volume in Q3 of last year. \u2047 Some of that increase is driven by the acquisition of BacklotCars, but I'm pleased that we were able to increase our overall volume by 20%, given the tight supply dynamics that exist across our industry. \u2047 If we look at the digital dealer-to-dealer category only, our Q3 volume of 118,000 -- was 118,000 vehicle sold. \u2047 The comparable metric for Q3 of last year was 58,000. \u2047 So, we grew our total digital dealer-to-dealer volume by 105%. \u2047 However, BacklotCars was not part of KAR in Q3 of last year. \u2047 And if we include BacklotCars in last year's number, the growth is approximately 19%. \u2047 We saw record numbers of participating sellers and buyers on our digital dealer-to-dealer platforms in both the U.S. and Canada in Q3. \u2047 We also saw continued growth in average vehicle value sold on both TradeRev in Canada and BacklotCars in the U.S. And finally, in Canada, our TradeRev business continued to perform very well, delivering strong volumes in the second consecutive quarter of solid profitability. \u2047 I'd like to spend a few moments on the acquisition of Carwave. \u2047 We closed on the acquisition of Carwave in early October. \u2047 So, our Q3 volumes do not reflect any volume from Carwave. \u2047 The Carwave acquisition has approximately 100,000 vehicles sold per annum. \u2047 Carwave originated in California and is the leading platform for dealers in that market. \u2047 California, as you might imagine, is a large automotive market. \u2047 If we look at new vehicle registrations statistics, there are more new vehicle registrations in California each year than in the smallest 20 states combined. \u2047 Also, California has almost as many new vehicle registrations as the next two largest markets, which are Texas and Florida, combined. \u2047 It's in our diligence that Carwave platform delivers excellent performance for the sellers and buyers. \u2047 The average vehicle value sold on Carwave is higher than that sold on BacklotCars, and it also generates a higher revenue per vehicle sold and is profitable. \u2047 And of course, the acquisition of Carwave also brings a strong team. \u2047 I believe the acquisition strengthens our map and increases the network effect for digital dealer-to-dealer business in the U.S. Carwave's strength out West and BacklotCars's strength in the middle of the United States means that we now have a stronger footprint than ever before in terms of both geography and depths within any given market. \u2047 Ultimately, we see an opportunity to combine those two businesses, bringing the best of both and creating an ever more powerful offering for sellers and the buyers. \u2047 We also see an opportunity to continue to move up market and sell a larger number of higher value vehicles. \u2047 This in turn will help drive further increases in revenue per unit sold and stronger margins. \u2047 So, our integration planning is ongoing. \u2047 But ultimately, we envision a single solution in the market; a solution that aligns with the needs and preferences of our dealers and that leverages the best technology, features, functionality and economic model of both platforms. \u2047 Now, given the strength of both businesses and the positive momentum that both businesses have, we would likely take a little longer to execute this than was the case with the TradeRev migration. \u2047 We want to make sure that we don't disrupt our customers and that to the extent we make changes, we're delivering an experience that is better than before for all of our customers. \u2047 And finally, the addition of Carwave means that our current run rate with digital dealer-to-dealer transactions is now very close to 600,000 vehicles sold per annum and continuing to grow. \u2047 So, we are well on our way toward achieving the target that I established in -- on our Analyst Day of 1.2 million digital dealer-to-dealer transactions annually by 2025. \u2047 So, I'd like to spend a few moments talking about our cost structure. \u2047 On recent earnings calls and, again, on the Analyst Day event, we've discussed our strategic focus on reducing our cost structure to reflect our transition to a more digital marketplace. \u2047 The reality of lower-than-normal commercial seller volumes likely persisting through much of 2022 means that our continued focus on cost remains a top priority for me and for the management team. \u2047 So, I'd like to provide an update on that. \u2047 During this last quarter, we initiated a project into prioritizing and accelerating key areas for growth while refining our operating model toward a more digital future and also to address the lower-than-normal commercial seller volumes that we are currently experiencing. \u2047 We've committed significant resources toward that initiative and there are four principal work streets. \u2047 I referred to these in our Analyst Day, but to recap them here, they're are as follows. \u2047 Our sales and go-to-market opportunities, the evolution of our service operations, our technology investments and the overall management of our SG&A. \u2047 So, I believe we've made very good progress on this project and we're now nearing the end of the assessment phase. \u2047 In fact, it will be completed within the next couple of weeks. \u2047 Now, I expect that you will be all interested to know the scale and the timing of all this. \u2047 Rather than committing to a number before I have the full report, I'd like to allow our team the opportunity to complete their work and I look forward to providing more in-depth assessment on our future call. \u2047 However, I am comfortable enough with the preliminary analysis to report the following. \u2047 First, in terms of the sizing of these opportunities. \u2047 Our Analyst Day materials pointed to an SG&A opportunity of $30 million. \u2047 I'm confident that our SG&A opportunity will be at least that amount. \u2047 However, SG&A is just one part of the mix. \u2047 We're also looking at opportunities to reduce our direct costs. \u2047 I believe that we have opportunities to do so and that these will be in addition to that number. \u2047 And finally, we're also looking at opportunities to improve revenue and improve the monetization of our services, while also accelerating growth in key areas. \u2047 These will be an important part of the overall target as well. \u2047 In terms of the timing. \u2047 First of all, I want to be clear that what I'm describing here are not short-term or temporary cost cuts. \u2047 What we're looking at are permanent changes in our operating model and our cost structure, reengineering the way we do business and ultimately, reducing our cost to serve over the long term. \u2047 I don't expect to see an impact from this in the current quarter, but I do expect to see positive impacts in 2022 and in all of the years following from that. \u2047 And finally, in terms of our strategy to manage and communicate these initiatives, we will be setting specific goals and there will be a clear process in place to measure the impacts to make sure we stay on track. \u2047 And of course, I expect myself and the management teams to be held accountable to those. \u2047 So, I look forward to providing greater detail and more precise metrics in a future call. \u2047 My last point is to make a few remarks on our expectations for the current quarter. \u2047 As discussed in September, it is difficult to predict the supply of vehicles in the wholesale market at this time. \u2047 We withdrew our guidance in September and I'm not providing guidance until our visibility into volume improves. \u2047 With that said, we typically experienced some seasonal impacts in the fourth quarter and I would expect that our fourth quarter performance, by which I'm referring to adjusted EBITDA, will be less than our Q3 levels. \u2047 So to summarize my key messages from today, clearly, the commercial volume challenges continue. \u2047 I believe that we're at the bottom now, but I think the volume challenges will continue well into next year. \u2047 However, I also expect we will see some improvement before the end of next year. \u2047 My longer-term view has not changed. \u2047 I believe that the outlook for off-lease, repossessed and rental vehicles will be one of increasing volume over time, ultimately returning to historical levels. \u2047 The recovery will take time, but it's clear to me that we should be a strong beneficiary of this when it happens. \u2047
