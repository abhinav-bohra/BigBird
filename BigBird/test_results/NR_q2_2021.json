{"article": ["Our second quarter results reflect another step forward in our strategy execution as we continue to reshape and position the company for sustainable and profitable growth. \u2047 Consolidated revenues improved 1% sequentially to $142 million with a 28% increase in international Fluids Systems and a 15% improvement in Industrial Solutions rental and service revenues, offsetting the previously anticipated pullback in Industrial Solution product sales that we discussed on our prior quarter call. \u2047 Second quarter EBITDA generation was $7 million. \u2047 Turning to the specifics of the segments. \u2047 Our Industrial Solutions business continues to demonstrate the value of our diversification efforts as we expand our presence in the power transmission and other industrial end markets. \u2047 As anticipated, coming off the exceptionally strong first quarter product sales, segment revenues declined 15% sequentially to $45 million in the second quarter as site access product sales pulled back to $10 million for the quarter. \u2047 Partially offsetting the product sales reduction, rental and service revenues improved 15% sequentially, contributing $33 million of revenue in the second quarter, including a record $25 million contribution from the power transmission and other industrial end markets, reflecting strong performance both in the United States and in the United Kingdom. \u2047 Industrial Blending revenues also pulled back to $2 million in the second quarter, reflecting the anticipated impact of product transition with our primary customer. \u2047 With the lower revenue, our Industrial Solutions operating margins declined modestly to 22% in the second quarter, generating $15 million of EBITDA. \u2047 Reflecting on our first half 2021 performance, it's worth highlighting that the power transmission and other industrial end markets contributed $75 million of our Site and Access Solutions revenues. \u2047 This annualized run rate of $150 million represents a 30% improvement over the previous high of $115 million achieved in 2018, illustrating the continued momentum in our market penetration. \u2047 Meanwhile, our historical upstream oil and gas end market contributed less than 20% of the first half 2021 segment revenues, reflecting the lower industry activity and our focus on the more stable industrial end markets. \u2047 In the Fluids Systems segment, revenues improved 11% sequentially, benefiting from project start-ups and the early phases of recovery within certain international markets following the COVID-related disruptions that significantly impacted the previous four quarters. \u2047 Our international revenues improved 28% sequentially to $35 million in the second quarter, benefiting primarily from improvements in Europe and North Africa. \u2047 In North America, revenues improved modestly to $62 million with a 19% improvement in the U.S., largely offset by the seasonal pullback in Canada. \u2047 Despite the revenue growth and positive earnings contributions from our international businesses, the Fluids segment remained below EBITDA breakeven in the second quarter, impacted by elevated operating expenses, including employee severance and cost associated with our ongoing inventory rationalization efforts. \u2047 In addition, the quarter is impacted by an unfavorable sales mix on U.S. land, which we expect to normalize going forward. \u2047 During the second quarter, I'm very pleased to highlight that we won two notable fluids contracts, including a three year award in Thailand to provide drilling and completion fluids on land, which reflects our first entry into the Southeast Asian market. \u2047 This contract is expected to provide approximately $25 million of revenue over the three year term with work scheduled to begin in the third quarter. \u2047 In addition, as part of the latest Shale Oil tender in the Gulf of Mexico, we were awarded a contract to continue providing drilling fluids, reservoir drilling fluids and related services for two deepwater drillships, which we expect will generate approximately $30 million of revenue annually. \u2047 We believe the recent contract awards are a direct result of our continued focus on providing differentiated technology and superior customer service. \u2047 As global activity improves in the energy market, we feel we are well positioned to capture our fair share of the value chain, while also continuing to reshape our cost structure to generate profitable growth and provide an acceptable return on capital. \u2047 And with that, I will hand the call over to Gregg to discuss in more detail the financials for the second quarter. \u2047 I'll begin by covering the specifics of the segment and consolidated financial results for the quarter before providing an update on our near-term outlook. \u2047 Total revenues for the Industrial Solutions segment declined 15% sequentially to $45 million in the second quarter, which includes a $43 million contribution from the Site and Access Solutions business and $2 million from Industrial Blending. \u2047 The sequential decline primarily reflects the anticipated $10 million reduction in product sales following the exceptionally strong Q1 performance along with a $3 million decline in Industrial Blending product sales. \u2047 Rental and service revenues improved 15% on a sequential basis, coming in at $33 million for the second quarter, which reflects our strongest quarter in nearly two years. \u2047 The sequential growth was driven by robust demand in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom with the U.S. benefiting from a few large scale utility projects completed in the second quarter. \u2047 As a result of the $8 million decline in revenues, the Industrial Solutions segment operating income declined by $3 million sequentially to $10 million, contributing $15 million of EBITDA in the second quarter. \u2047 Comparing to the second quarter of last year, revenues from the Site and Access Solutions business increased $16 million or 59%. \u2047 This increase includes an $11 million or 50% improvement in rental and service revenues along with a $5 million improvement in product sales. \u2047 Looking at the first half 2021 for the Industrial Solutions business, as Paul touched on, it's notable that we're continuing to see a significant shift within our segment revenue mix. \u2047 More specifically, the power transmission end market contributes more than half of our Industrial Solutions segment revenues, while our historical E&P market activity accounts for less than 20%. \u2047 Turning to Fluids Systems. \u2047 Total segment revenues improved by 11% sequentially to $97 million in the second quarter. \u2047 Revenues from U.S. land increased $10 million or 24% sequentially, reflecting the benefit of the 16% improvement in market rig count along with an increase in market share, which stands at roughly 20%. \u2047 All U.S. land regions contributed to the sequential revenue improvement. \u2047 Revenues from the Gulf of Mexico declined modestly, contributing $8 million in the second quarter. \u2047 In Canada, revenues followed the typical seasonal pattern through spring breakup, declining 61% sequentially to $5 million in the second quarter. \u2047 Outside of North America, as Paul noted, we are beginning to see the early signs of recovery, particularly in Europe and North Africa. \u2047 International revenues improved $8 million sequentially to $35 million in the second quarter as delayed projects moved forward, although it's worth noting that COVID-related restrictions continue to suppress customer activity, particularly in the Middle East. \u2047 As Paul touched on, while our international Fluids business performance was relatively in line with our expectations, our U.S. operations were negatively impacted by elevated expenses in the quarter along with an unfavorable sales mix. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, our Fluids Systems revenues increased $22 million or 30%. \u2047 U.S. land revenues increased by $21 million or 74%, which significantly outpaced the 16% increase in market rig count over this period. \u2047 The strong revenue growth primarily reflects our increased market share and improvements in customer spending per well along with higher barite sales and our continued expansion into stimulation chemicals. \u2047 Gulf of Mexico revenues declined $6 million or 44% year-over-year, driven primarily by the changes in customer drilling and completion plans, including a strong contribution from completion fluids in the prior year quarter. \u2047 International revenues improved $6 million or 22% year-over-year, benefiting from new project start-ups and the recovery of customer activity in several European markets and Algeria, while the Middle East remains roughly $2 million below prior year levels, reflecting the ongoing COVID challenges. \u2047 SG&A costs were $23 million in the second quarter, which includes $6.9 million of corporate office expenses, reflecting a $2 million increase from both the prior quarter as well as the second quarter of last year. \u2047 The sequential and year-over-year increase is primarily attributable to higher long-term incentive expense, including awards tied to our relative share price performance as well as the April 1 restoration of certain austerity measures, including the company matching contributions to our U.S. retirement plan. \u2047 Interest expense decreased modestly to $2.2 million in the second quarter, nearly half of which reflects non-cash amortization of facility fees and discounts. \u2047 Our weighted average cash borrowing rate on our outstanding debt is approximately 3.5%. \u2047 The second quarter includes a $400,000 income tax expense despite reporting a pre-tax loss. \u2047 We are currently unable to recognize the tax benefits on our U.S. losses, and therefore, the income tax expense primarily reflects taxes on foreign earnings. \u2047 Our net loss in the second quarter was $0.07 per share, which compares to a net loss of $0.06 per share in the first quarter and a net loss of $0.29 per share in the second quarter of last year, which included $0.09 of charges. \u2047 Turning to cash flow. \u2047 Net working capital changes used $7 million of cash in the second quarter as we saw DSOs return as anticipated to a more typical level from the unusually strong performance achieved in the prior quarter. \u2047 With the higher working capital, cash used in operating activities was a modest $2 million for the quarter. \u2047 Investing activities again used less than $1 million of cash in the second quarter with $2 million of capital investments largely offset by proceeds from sales of used mats from our rental fleet and other underutilized assets. \u2047 We ended the second quarter with a total debt balance of $78 million and a cash balance of $35 million, resulting in a modest 14% debt to capital ratio and 8% net debt to capital ratio. \u2047 As such, the convertible notes are now classified as long-term debt in the June 30, 2021 balance sheet. \u2047 Now turning to our near-term outlook. \u2047 As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the improving longer term fundamentals in both business segments, but we continue to see significant inflationary pressures on raw materials and transportation. \u2047 We are also closely monitoring the evolving situation with the COVID variants around the world. \u2047 In the Site and Access Solutions business, while we are very pleased with the strong growth rate in targeted end markets, we expect the near-term market activity in the utility sector will face the typical seasonal slowdown seen in past years as utility companies reduce project activity during the period of high electricity demand associated with the elevated summer temperatures. \u2047 Although we are continuing to execute our geographic expansion efforts, we anticipate that Q3 rental and service revenues will return to near Q1 levels. \u2047 Looking beyond Q3, we continue to be encouraged by the robust pipeline of opportunities as we execute our growth strategy. \u2047 On the product sales side, although it is always difficult to predict the timing of sales activity, we expect revenues will remain relatively in line with Q2 in the near-term, with the fourth quarter expected to benefit from the year end strength in the utility sector. \u2047 In total, we expect Q3 revenues for the Industrial Solutions segment will pull back modestly to roughly $40 million. \u2047 And with the seasonal slowdown in rental project activity as well as our ongoing investments to support our growth strategy, we expect operating margins to decline into the low to mid-teens for the third quarter, which should reflect the softest quarterly results for the year. \u2047 Beyond Q3, we expect both revenues and operating margin will rebound in Q4, benefiting from the year end product sales demand and our ongoing penetration in the power transmission and other industrial markets. \u2047 In Fluids Systems, we continue to expect our international markets will recover through the second half of 2021, ultimately returning to pre-COVID levels by the end of the year. \u2047 With the lingering effects of COVID, particularly in the Middle East, we expect international revenues will increase by roughly 10% in Q3 with a more pronounced improvement in Q4. \u2047 In addition, we expect to see strong quarter-over-quarter growth in North America in Q3, led by our robust recovery in Canada from the seasonal trough and the continued improvements in U.S. land. \u2047 In the Gulf of Mexico, we expect Q3 revenues will remain fairly in line with the second quarter as a Q3 start-up on the second deepwater drillship will likely offset the decline in completion fluids products which are excluded from the recent contract award. \u2047 In total, we anticipate our Fluids segment revenues will grow by a low-teens percentage in Q3, which should bring the segment closer to breakeven operating income for the quarter with a return to positive income expected in Q4. \u2047 With regard to capex, we expect expenditures in the near-term will remain fairly limited with investments focused on growth opportunities within the Industrial Solutions segment. \u2047 Corporate office expense is expected to increase by roughly $1 million from the Q2 level, largely reflecting the timing of long-term performance-based incentive expense along with the full lifting of salary austerity measures put in place during 2020. \u2047 Overall, I'm pleased with the continuing progress we've made in the second quarter. \u2047 Looking ahead, there are obvious ongoing market hurdles to navigate, including meaningful cost inflation as well as the elevated uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID variants around the world. \u2047 With that said, we remain encouraged by the longer term market fundamentals in all of the key industries that we serve, which we believe provides the opportunity for sustainable and profitable growth over the long-term. \u2047 Further, with our very modest debt level and our capital-light Fluids business model, we are well positioned to fund growth objectives and generate strong free cash flow over the long-term. \u2047 Our key priorities remain unchanged, beginning with our expansion and diversification of the Industrial Solutions business. \u2047 As we continue to execute on our strategy, we're very pleased with the growing market awareness of the unique value proposition that we provide within the multi-billion dollar power transmission market. \u2047 Benefiting from our strong utility sector growth, our Industrial Solutions segment contributed 35% of our first half revenues, while consistently generating strong profitability and returns. \u2047 Expanding this business remains our highest priority, including expansion of our geographical reach and invest in the necessary capital to support our targeted growth plans. \u2047 On the Industrial Blending operations, although we are disappointed by the shift in outlook that our primary customer is seeing in the demand for disinfectants and cleaning products, it's important to highlight that we view this reduction in near-term demand as a typical challenge for a new business. \u2047 Over the past year, the surge in cleaning product demand associated with the fight against COVID, provided us an opportunity to quickly penetrate the Industrial Blending market and showcase"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly loss per share $0.07."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q2 earnings per share $0.07.  \u2047  q2 earnings per
