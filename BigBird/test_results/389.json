{"article": ["Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released first quarter 2021 financial results. \u2047 These statements include but aren't limited to, financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. \u2047 Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures, otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. \u2047 As we anniversary our one year impact of the pandemic on our financial results, I'd like to briefly reflect on the current environment and to discuss our 2021 and longer-term priorities as a company. \u2047 I'd also like to touch on Edwards' response to the pandemic and our efforts to better support our patients, employees and the community. \u2047 Recall that our sales were dramatically impacted in the last few weeks of Q1 2020 as procedures fell due to COVID disruptions. \u2047 One year later, after an extraordinarily difficult global crisis, I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery and although we recognize that many people are still struggling around the world. \u2047 Our sales growth this quarter was better than expected across all product lines. \u2047 Although we expect the pandemic will impact the global healthcare system based on the environment as we exited the quarter, we have continued confidence in our positive 2021 outlook. \u2047 We continue to believe that 2021 will be an important growth year for Edwards with mid-teen sales growth highlighting the importance of treating structural heart patients even during this pandemic. \u2047 We also anticipate meaningful progress on expanding large under-appreciated and underserved transcatheter opportunities in 2021. \u2047 Recently, we achieved several important milestones. \u2047 Let me mention four. \u2047 Just last week, in transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR, we received approval to initiate a pivotal trial for patients suffering from moderate aortic stenosis. \u2047 Also earlier this month, we received approval to begin treating patients at low surgical risk in Japan with SAPIEN 3. \u2047 And in Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, or TMTT, I'm pleased to announce that the first patients were recently treated with EVOQUE Eos, our next-generation Transcatheter Mitral Replacement System. \u2047 Also in TMTT, we initiated the TRISCEND II US pivotal trial for transcatheter tricuspid replacement. \u2047 Looking beyond 2021, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and our pipeline of innovative therapies. \u2047 Our patient-focused culture drives us and motivates our employees around the world every day. \u2047 Our R&D targets breakthrough therapies that can create significant value for patients and health systems enabling strong organic sales growth and exceptional shareholder returns. \u2047 Despite COVID disruptions, we've continued to invest aggressively for future growth. \u2047 As a reminder, about a third of our research and development investments today are focused on generating a robust body of guideline changing clinical evidence and although clinical studies slowed during the pandemic, our dedicated clinician partners are eager to accelerate enrolment in this important research. \u2047 Regulators have also been supported in addressing the impact of the pandemic and its impact on clinical studies. \u2047 Finally, I want to provide some perspective on how we've maintained our focus on creating long-term value as we navigated the pandemic over the last year. \u2047 We continue to invest in our people, in our infrastructure. \u2047 During a time when widespread uncertainty impacted many families across the globe, we have prioritized protecting our employees and have grown our team. \u2047 We enhanced employee benefits, rewarded performance and protected incentives. \u2047 We also moved ahead on expanding Edwards research and production facilities around the world. \u2047 We adjusted our agreements to support hospitals as they navigated COVID and additionally, we provided extra support to the communities where our employees live and work. \u2047 In fact, we recently converted one of our facilities into a mass COVID vaccination site to support the community of 3 million people, where our company is headquartered. \u2047 As a company, we expect that Edwards will be positioned even stronger and be able to help more patients than ever before as the world emerges from the pandemic. \u2047 Now, turning to our first quarter results. \u2047 We reported $1.2 billion in sales this quarter, up 5% on a constant currency basis from a year ago. \u2047 Recall that our guidance assumed Q1 sales would be in line with the first quarter of last year, which was largely unaffected by COVID. \u2047 We were pleased with how sales improved as the quarter progressed. \u2047 In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $792 million, up 4% on an underlying basis. \u2047 The SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform remains differentiated with low complication rates, ease of use and significant potential for length of stay efficiency. \u2047 Our average selling prices were stable and we estimated that global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth. \u2047 In the US, our Q1 TAVR sales were flat with fourth quarter and year-ago results and we estimate that overall US procedure growth was comparable. \u2047 Consistent with our guidance on the Q4 earnings call in late January, COVID stressed the global healthcare system during the winter months. \u2047 We are encouraged, however, that US TAVR procedures grew as COVID hospitalizations decrease and vaccinations increased during the quarter. \u2047 Small and medium-sized centers played a valuable role in serving patients during the quarter. \u2047 We continue to activate new centers this quarter as we have been throughout the pandemic. \u2047 This demonstrates the clear interest of many smaller centers to provide state-of-the-art care for structural heart patients. \u2047 Outside the US, in the first quarter, we estimated TAVR procedures grew in the low-double digits on a year-over-year basis and Edwards growth was comparable. \u2047 Although we are off to a strong start, the slow vaccination progress outside the US provides uncertainty for the remainder of the year. \u2047 Edwards underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single digit range. \u2047 Edwards growth in countries with lower TAVR adoption rates outpaced countries where the therapy is more established. \u2047 Although TAVR centers were more prepared to treat patients, patient flow was disrupted due to regional lockdowns and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease. \u2047 Sales growth in Japan and other countries was strong as aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated disease and we remain focused on increasing the availability of TAVR therapy. \u2047 As previously noted, we received approval earlier this month in Japan for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk. \u2047 We anticipate increased treatment rates when reimbursement is approved later this year. \u2047 In addition to geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain dedicated to pursuing indication expansions. \u2047 Our groundbreaking early TAVR trial is focused on patients who have severe aortic stenosis, but without recognized symptoms and who do not meet the current guidelines for valve replacement. \u2047 We expect enrollment to increase as we and participating sites are motivated to complete enrollment of the trial this year. \u2047 I'm also pleased to report that we received FDA approval for a pivotal trial for TAVR in moderate AS patients as we expect enrollment to begin later this year. \u2047 Based on recent trials, we're learning on what was once thought of as the benign precursor to severe aortic stenosis may actually be associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality than previously recognized. \u2047 Thus, we believe TAVR may be a future treatment option for these patients. \u2047 Separately, last week, we received SAPIEN 3 CE Mark approval to begin treating patients with a previously repaired or replaced valve in the pulmonic position. \u2047 Looking ahead to the upcoming virtual EuroPCR meeting next month, we expect long-term follow-up data from our European Registry on SAPIEN 3 as well as the late-breaking clinical trial results on low risk bicuspid patients. \u2047 In summary, based on the strength we saw at the end of the first quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow in the 15% to 20% range in 2021. \u2047 We expect continued near-term COVID-related regional disruptions and a more normalized second half of the year. \u2047 We remain confident that this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digits. \u2047 We're enrolling five pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio of technologies to support patients suffering from tricuspid and mitral valve disorders. \u2047 This quarter, we progress with the enrollment of our three CLASP pivotal trials for PASCAL. \u2047 We continue to expect approval for patients with DMR late next year. \u2047 This is expected to be the first commercial approval of the PASCAL system in the US. \u2047 We've also begun treating patients with EVOQUE TR in the TRISCEND II randomized pivotal trial in accordance with the FDA's breakthrough pathway designation. \u2047 This trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. \u2047 In addition, the first patients were recently treated with our next-generation Transcatheter Mitral Replacement System called EVOQUE Eos through the MISCEND study. \u2047 This study will evaluate the safety and performance of EVOQUE Eos, which is designed to advance the treatment of patients with mitral regurgitation with low profile valve delivered through a sub-30 French transfemoral delivery system. \u2047 We believe our two platform replacement strategy with SAPIEN M3 and EVOQUE Eos strongly positions us to be the leader in treating these underserved patients. \u2047 These include longer-term outcomes for transcatheter mitral repair from our CLASP trial and the first report of 30-day outcomes with EVOQUE tricuspid replacement from our TRISCEND study. \u2047 Turning to our results. \u2047 First quarter global sales were $16 million, driven by continued adoption of our PASCAL system and activation of more centers across Europe. \u2047 Assuming diminishing COVID-related impact, we expect to ramp up sales throughout the year. \u2047 We remain confident in our 2021 sales guidance of $80 million as we advance commercialization, staying focused on physician training, procedural success and patient outcomes. \u2047 Adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes remain key drivers to transforming treatment. \u2047 In summary, we are making meaningful progress toward our 2021 milestones and we continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2025. \u2047 We remain committed to transforming the treatment of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease around the world. \u2047 In Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter 2021 global sales was $213 million, increased 7% on an underlying basis over the prior year. \u2047 Despite a soft start associated with COVID, we are encouraged by the improvement across all regions over the course of the quarter. \u2047 Notably, growth was lifted by premium products and improved as declining COVID cases enabled more hospitals to resume treating surgical structural heart patients. \u2047 We remain very encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves, including continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve. \u2047 We anticipate that adoption will be bolstered by the five-year data from our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the Society of Thoracic Surgeon, which demonstrates the excellent durability of this tissue technology. \u2047 And we're pleased that in the first quarter, we initiated sales of INSPIRIS in China. \u2047 Sales in the US also continue to gain traction with KONECT RESILIA, the first preassembled aortic tissue valve conduit for patients who require replacement of the valve, route and ascending aorta, a critical unmet patient need. \u2047 Finally, we're pleased to announce that we received regulatory approval with reimbursement in Japan for our MITRIS RESILIA valve, a new mitral valve incorporating our newest tissue technology. \u2047 Yesterday, in Japan, we performed our first commercial cases with this differentiated innovation. \u2047 In summary, we have confidence in our full-year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for Surgical Structural Heart, driven by market adoption of our premium technologies. \u2047 We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structural Heart market will grow in the mid-single digits through 2026. \u2047 In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $196 million increased 4% on an underlying basis, driven by increased sales of technologies for both the operating room and intensive care units. \u2047 HemoSphere orders increased as hospital capital spending began to show signs of recovery. \u2047 Demand for our products used in high-risk surgeries remain strong and our ClearSight non-invasive finger cuff used in elective procedures also recovered to near pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU remained in demand due to elevated hospitalizations in both the US and Europe at the beginning of Q1. \u2047 We continue to expect full year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for critical care. \u2047 We remain excited about our pipeline of critical care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. \u2047 Well, we are encouraged by the start to our year. \u2047 Despite COVID still impacting the global healthcare system in the first quarter, we were able to post positive year-over-year sales growth across all of our product lines and regions as our advanced therapies helped patients globally. \u2047 Total sales grew 5% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was better than the flat growth we expected when we gave guidance for the first quarter back in January. \u2047 This stronger-than-expected sales performance fell through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, which was 8% higher than the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 The improvement in our sales performance during the quarter was choppy, but we exited the quarter in a stronger position and that gives us continued confidence in our outlook for the balance of the year. \u2047 While macro conditions remain variable across our key geographies, we're projecting total sales in the second quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.60. \u2047 As our business continues to rebound from the impact of COVID, we expect sales to strengthen and expenses to grow as travel and clinical trials ramp up. \u2047 We are maintaining all of our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. \u2047 For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion; for TAVR, $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, approximately $80 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $800 million to $900 million; and for Critical Care, $725 million to $800 million. \u2047 And based on our first quarter earnings, we are"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports qtrly earnings per share
