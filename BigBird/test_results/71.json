{"article": ["regional and global economy, and the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its tenants. \u2047 Joining us today are Tom O'Hern, chief executive officer; Scott Kingsmore, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer; and Doug Healey, senior executive vice president, Leasing. \u2047 We had releasing spreads of 5% and occupancy at nearly 91%. \u2047 At the end of the third quarter, most of our town centers were open with only our three closed centers in Los Angeles remaining closed by government mandate. \u2047 Those centers reopened in early October. \u2047 So as of today, all of our centers are open and our tenants are eagerly planning for a busy holiday season. \u2047 Most of the results were better than the second quarter, but we were obviously adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID in general and specifically due to the protracted California and New York City closures. \u2047 I'm very appreciative of the entire Macerich team that did a tremendous job of getting our centers reopened safely in some cases for a second time. \u2047 Some of the self-health and safety measures we took went way beyond CDC recommendations that included significantly upgrading our air filtration systems to include hospital quality air filtration with[Inaudible] filters; engage the clinical head of Infectious Disease at UCLA Medical Center to review and advise us on our protocols and policies. \u2047 We hired a nationally renown engineering firm to advise us on advanced HVAC systems and protocols. \u2047 We implemented modified hours, increased cleaning and sanitizing protocols, CDC guidelines, and approved products that are baseline for our services. \u2047 In terms of rent collections, we are much better off in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. \u2047 During the third quarter, our average rent collections were 80%. \u2047 October is trending above 80%. \u2047 For most of the tenants not paying rent during the closure period, we would generally come to terms with them. \u2047 In general, we agreed to rent relief usually in the form of deferred rent for the closure months with repayment in 2021. \u2047 In many cases, in exchange for landlord-favorable amendments to leases. \u2047 There were some large reserves for uncollectible rents in the quarter, which Scott will comment on. \u2047 Cash flow continues to improve by the month as we move into the fourth quarter, and I expect that to continue. \u2047 As of today, we have significant liquidity and currently have approximately $675 million of cash on the balance sheet. \u2047 The tenant reactions to reopening has been good. \u2047 Our tenants, almost without exception, were eager to get reopened. \u2047 By October, for centers opened at least eight weeks, sales were up to 90% of pre-COVID levels. \u2047 The consumer is shopping with a purpose and there has been pent-up demand. \u2047 Our second quarter was more about getting centers opened and getting our tenants open safely and less about leasing. \u2047 The focus in the third quarter was collecting past due rents and started to shift back to leasing. \u2047 Looking at traffic, in general, it's running about 80% compared to a year ago. \u2047 Some of that has to do with capacity limits, particularly for restaurants and also for having no seating in the food court. \u2047 Sales, on the other hand, are running on average 90% of a year ago, which means there, I'd say, higher capture rate. \u2047 This year will be a different holiday season. \u2047 We believe it's going to start earlier. \u2047 Operating hours will be shorter. \u2047 There will be capacity limits. \u2047 With consumers not spending money on vacations and entertainment during COVID, most of our consumers in our markets have money to spend this holiday season. \u2047 Top categories are expected to be fitness and wellness, home furnishings, electronics and athletic leisure. \u2047 There will be[Inaudible] but with lots of social distancing. \u2047 We've got a number of questions about potential for property tax increases in California, although small in the political scheme of things. \u2047 There was a proposition in California that would have increased property taxes on commercial property. \u2047 It is known as Proposition 15. \u2047 That proposition would have removed the protection of Prop 13 from commercial properties in California. \u2047 For us, generally, we structure our leases to pass-through taxes to the tenant as a recoverable expense with a significant bottom line impact that the[Inaudible] shows Prop 15 passing. \u2047 As of today, it is trailing. \u2047 The yes votes stand at 48.7%, the no are at 51.3%. \u2047 So hopefully, that means no increase for commercial taxes in California. \u2047 Looking at the balance of 2020. \u2047 The pandemic has shown that good retail is not going away, especially in A quality centers. \u2047 Digitally native brands appreciate, more than ever, the profitability of their physical stores. \u2047 Big format retailers got active again in the third quarter, and you'll hear some of the specifics from Doug. \u2047 Although we are still in the midst of COVID, our centers are operating at 90% capacity, sales levels of 90% pre-COVID. \u2047 And even if you look at one of the more challenging categories, restaurants, in our portfolio, we have 247 restaurants and 94% of those are open today. \u2047 The second quarter was an extremely unique quarter and some of the second quarter challenges carried into the third quarter and may even carry partially into the fourth quarter. \u2047 But many metrics got better in the third quarter, specifically collections. \u2047 And the number of tenants opened and the progress we are making on leasing activity. \u2047 The impact on reserves for adoption accounts was less than 20  \u2047  second quarter of '20, but still much higher than normal. \u2047 We expect to gradually improve to a more normal level in the first quarter of '21. \u2047 Although there are still too many uncertainties to give guidance, we expect the fourth quarter of 2020 and the year 2021 to be much better than the second and third quarters of 2020. \u2047 Disruption from COVID-19 continued to severely impact 2020 results in the third quarter. \u2047 Funds from operations for the third quarter was $0.52 per share, down from the third quarter of 2019 at $0.88 per share. \u2047 Same-center net operating income for the quarter was down 29%, and year to date, it was down 17%. \u2047 Changes between the third quarter of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2019 were driven primarily by the following factors and the numbers I'm going to cover[Inaudible] for the company: One, $20 million  \u2047  $21 million in bad debt allowance in the form of the $14 million of increased net debt expense versus the third quarter of 2019, coupled with $7 million of lease revenue reverse for tenants, that are accounted for on a cash basis per GAAP within the third quarter; two, over $20 million of short-term nonrecurring rental assistance; three, a $9 million decline in common area and ancillary revenue as well as percentage rents; four, a $4 million decline in parking income driven by protracted property closures and reduced parking utilization at our urban centers in New York City and Chicago primarily; five, interest expense increased $4 million due to a decline in capitalized interest; six, net operating income declined from the Hyatt Regency Hotel[Inaudible], it was about a $2 million decline; seven, a negative $0.03 per share dilutive impact from shares issued in the second quarter relating to our stock dividend issued in the second quarter. \u2047 These factors were all offset by increased lease termination income of $7 million and land sale gains totaling $11 million net impact. \u2047 Revenue declines from occupancy loss also contributed to declines in both net operating income and FFO for the third quarter. \u2047 As Tom mentioned, we are not providing updated 2020 earnings guidance given continued uncertainties. \u2047 We do anticipate continued volatility operating results in the fourth quarter. \u2047 While we're not providing guidance for 2021, as we mentioned last quarter, we still believe that 2020 will be a trough in the company's operating results including primarily to the following factors: The pandemic has effectively accelerated the financial troubles with numerous[Inaudible], resulting in a wave of bankruptcy filings that were funneled and due 2020. \u2047 We do not anticipate this volume to recur in 2021. \u2047 The majority of the filings have resulted in reorgs and not full fleet liquidations. \u2047 We do expect approximately a 3% cumulative drop in occupancy from lease rejections, approximately half of which is already embedded within the 90.8% reported occupancy[Inaudible] third quarter, and the balance of these stores will close within the fourth quarter. \u2047 Year to date, we have reported $57 million in additional bad debt reserves versus 2019, including $50 million of bad debt expenses and $7 million of lease revenue reversals for tenants accounted for on a cash basis. \u2047 Similar levels of reserves are certainly not anticipated going forward. \u2047 We've recorded well over $20 million in nonrecurring short-term rental assistance year to date and we expect those to continue into the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 And then lastly, we anticipate increases to transit revenue line item going forward into 2021, namely the percentage rent, temporary tenant income, parking garage revenue, advertising, sponsorship, vending and other ancillary property driven revenue. \u2047 We look forward to providing 2021 guidance on our typical cadence this time next quarter. \u2047 Given the continued improvement in rent collections of 80% in the third quarter and over 80% in October, liquidity continues to improve. \u2047 Cash on hand has increased from $573 million at June 30 to $630 million at September 30. \u2047 And as Tom noted, liquidity continues to improve to this day. \u2047 This improved liquidity is solely due to improved operating cash flow and is a testament to the herculean efforts by our people to both secure the right to open all of our properties and to negotiate thousands of agreements with our retailers. \u2047 With continued progress in these negotiations, which Doug will soon elaborate upon, we anticipate further improvement to operating cash flow throughout the year. \u2047 We are closing on a 10-year $95 million financing on Tysons Vita, the residential tower at Tysons Corner. \u2047 The loan will have a fixed rate of 3.3% and will include interest-only payment during the entire loan term. \u2047 This will provide approximately $47 million of liquidity to the company, and we expect the loan closing to occur within the next several weeks. \u2047 We secured a short-term extension on Danbury Fair through April 1, 2021. \u2047 The loan amount and interest rate remain unchanged following that extension. \u2047 We have agreed to terms with the loan servicer for a three-year extension on Fashion Outlets of Niagara, which will extend the loan maturity through October of 2023. \u2047 We expect the loan amount and interest rate also to be unchanged following that extension. \u2047 And then lastly, we continue to work with our lenders to secure loan extensions for the nonrecourse mortgages on each of FlatIron Crossing, Green Acres Mall and the power center adjacent to that Green Acres Commons, and we anticipate securing extended term within the coming weeks. \u2047 Like the second quarter, the majority of our efforts in the third quarter involved getting our retail partners open as quickly and as safely as possible once our centers were allowed to reopen. \u2047 To date, all of our properties are open, and I'm happy to report that 93% of the square footage that was opened pre-COVID is now open today. \u2047 As I discussed on our last call, it has been the case in the third quarter, much of our time and energy was spent working with those retailers that did not have the ability to pay rent while closed. \u2047 And we've made great progress. \u2047 In fact, as we look at our top 200 rent paying retailers, we've either received full rent payment or secured executed documents with 147 and are in LOI with another 23, all of which totals approximately 93% of the total rent these top 200 pay. \u2047 Consequently, collections continue to improve. \u2047 Third quarter saw an average collection rate of 80%, that's compared to 61% in the second quarter. \u2047 And as of today, as Tom mentioned, our collection rate for October stands at about 81%. \u2047 But the third quarter wasn't all about collection. \u2047 As our centers continue to open and as our retailers opened and were able to trade with some consistency, the leasing climate began to improve. \u2047 Retailers began executing leases that have been out since before COVID. \u2047 But most importantly, the retailers began committing to new deals again. \u2047 A true sign that for the first time in months, we're now looking forward rather than solely focusing on the past. \u2047 I'll expand on this in a moment, but first, let's take a look at some of the third-quarter metrics. \u2047 Portfolio-related sales for the third quarter were $718 per square foot, and that's computed to exclude the period of COVID closures for each tenant. \u2047 The $718 is down from $800 per square foot at the end of the third-quarter 2019. \u2047 For centers opened the entire month, sales in September were actually 92% of what they were a year ago, once we exclude Apple and Tesla. \u2047 Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 90.8%. \u2047 That's down 50 basis points from last quarter and down 3% from a year ago. \u2047 This is primarily due to store closures for bankruptcies and from our local tenants that couldn't survive the pandemic. \u2047 Temporary occupancy was 5.7%, that's down 70 basis points from this time last year. \u2047 Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 4.9%, that's down from 5.1% last quarter and down from 8.3% in Q3 2019. \u2047 Average rent for the portfolio was $62.29, down from $62.48 last quarter, but up 1.8% from $61.16 one year ago. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, the leasing environment continues to improve. \u2047 In the third quarter, we signed 120 leases to 342,000 square feet. \u2047 This is over 3x the number of deals and square footage that was signed in the second quarter, and these stats do not include any COVID workouts. \u2047 Some leases signed in the third quarter of note include Gucci, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Ducati Paris at Scottsdale Fashion Square; Kids Empire and State 48 Brewery at SanTan; Barbarie's Grill at Danbury Fair; Starbucks at Fashion District Philadelphia; Madison Reed at 29th Street; Polestar at The Village at Corte Madera; finally, Lucid Motors at Scottsdale Fashion Square and Tysons Corner. \u2047 Both Lucid and Polestar are new additions to the electronic car category and first to the Macerich portfolio. \u2047 As we head toward the end of the year, much of our focus is on our 2021 lease expiration and finalizing deals in order to secure as much expiring square footage in 2021 as possible"], "gold_summary": ["macerich q3 ffo per share $0.52 excluding items.  \u2047  q3 ffo per
