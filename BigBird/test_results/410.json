{"article": ["Erik Gershwind, our chief executive officer; and Kristen Actis-Grande, our chief financial officer, are both on the call with me. \u2047 As on our last call, we are all remote, so bear with us if we encounter any technical difficulties. \u2047 The risk factors include our comments on the potential impact of COVID-19. \u2047 And let me start by saying that I hope everyone remains safe and healthy. \u2047 After that, we're going to look forward and we're going to look forward to the next three years to discuss what is the next stage of our transformation journey. \u2047 We've completed the heavy lifting of our sales force transformation and are now focused on accelerating market share capture and improving profitability. \u2047 This is a companywide effort that we're calling Mission Critical. \u2047 And Mission Critical is more than just a project name, it's reflective of our business strategy of serving as a mission-critical partner to our customers on their plant floors. \u2047 And it also reflects the fact that accelerating market share capture and improving profitability and doing so with urgency is mission critical for our organization and our stakeholders. \u2047 A lot more is coming on this shortly, but I'll first turn to the quarter, and we've provided some highlights on Slide 3. \u2047 Our fiscal fourth-quarter financial results continue to reflect solid execution in a tough environment. \u2047 Versus the prior year period, overall sales were down 11.3% or 12.7% on an average daily sales basis. \u2047 Gross margin was down 40 basis points and operating margin was 9.8% as compared to 10.7% in the prior year. \u2047 Excluding one-time adjustments, our operating margin was 11.2%, down just 30 basis points from 11.5% in the prior year due to implementing effective cost controls. \u2047 This all resulted in solid earnings for the quarter. \u2047 As we noted in our August sales release, sales of our nonsafety and nonjanitorial product lines have continued to improve sequentially through the quarter. \u2047 Sales of safety and janitorial products also continued growing, with year-over-year growth of roughly 20% each month on average and for the quarter. \u2047 Looking at our performance by customer type. \u2047 National Accounts declined slightly more than 20%, while our core customers declined mid-teens and CCSG was down in the low double-digits. \u2047 Government sales and that's both state and federal, were up significantly due to the surge in large safety and janitorial orders, partially offsetting the declines in the other customer types. \u2047 All of this shows that sales levels have continued to lift and have seen a slight increase in the rate of improvement over the past couple of months. \u2047 Most manufacturing end markets, while showing sequential improvements in the quarter, are still soft. \u2047 Many national accounts are running one shift as opposed to the two or three shifts they were running pre-pandemic. \u2047 Our job shop and machine shop customers continue carrying smaller-than-normal backlogs. \u2047 These customers remain cautious about spending and they're burning off inventory as much as possible, given continued uncertainty. \u2047 The persistence of COVID-19 and its potential for future surge is certainly playing a role in all of this. \u2047 And this caution is reflected in recent sentiment indices, such as the MBI, which remains negative on a rolling 12-month average. \u2047 That said, the readings have improved over the past couple of months and actually reached neutral territory in September. \u2047 Should this improvement continue, it would bode well for our business and should translate into continued sequential lift in our revenues. \u2047 In terms of end markets, the softness in industrial demand was broad-based, with acute weakness in heavily metalworking-centric end markets such as aerospace and oil and gas. \u2047 There are some pockets of strength in certain areas, but not in our core end markets which remain suppressed. \u2047 We continue to hear that local distributors are suffering. \u2047 And the longer that the weak conditions persist, the more pressure they're coming under. \u2047 This continues to create market share capture opportunities and we are focused on capitalizing on them. \u2047 Moving now to gross margins. \u2047 I remain pleased with our performance. \u2047 In particular, we're executing well on both the pricing and the purchase cost fronts. \u2047 We're seeing strong realization from our annual price increase and we're continuing to benefit from supplier programs on the purchase cost line. \u2047 You'll note that our sequential drop from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in gross margin was on the higher side of the typical seasonal decline. \u2047 This was strictly the result of mix and, in particular, the sale of PPE-related SKUs. \u2047 Absent this headwind, we maintained underlying gross margin stability. \u2047 September and October gross margins continued our recent trending. \u2047 Price and costs are performing well, but will likely have continued PPE mix pressure in the first quarter, similar in size to that of our fourth quarter. \u2047 Looking beyond the first quarter, as we move past the PPE-related mix noise, we expect gross margins to remain at levels close to or at prior year. \u2047 Cash flow in the quarter remained strong and allowed us to repay a significant amount of debt. \u2047 He and the team did an exceptional job over the past few months, particularly during the COVID crisis. \u2047 We're grateful, Greg, for your hard work. \u2047 And of course, you continue to be an integral part of our future efforts. \u2047 It's great to be here, and I am looking forward to the work ahead of us. \u2047 Over the coming months, hopefully, I'll have an opportunity to meet those of you on the phone who I haven't met already, although that will probably be virtual, of course. \u2047 As Erik mentioned, I'm going to run us quickly through the numbers for our fiscal fourth quarter and then, we'll devote time to discussing Mission Critical. \u2047 Our fourth-quarter sales were $748 million, a decline of 11.3% versus the same quarter last year. \u2047 Our average daily sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $11.7 million, a decrease of 12.7% on an ADS basis versus the same quarter last year. \u2047 Our operating margin was 9.8% compared to 10.7% in the same period last year. \u2047 Excluding severance and other costs, our adjusted operating margin was 11.2% versus an adjusted 11.5% in the prior year. \u2047 Within our operating profits, Erik touched on the items impacting our gross margin, which was 41.6% or 40 basis points below the prior year. \u2047 So I'll go a little deeper now into our operating expenses. \u2047 Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $238 million or 31.9% of sales versus $263 million or 31.2% of sales in the prior year. \u2047 This also includes about $11.2 million of costs related to severance and the review of our operating model mentioned on previous calls. \u2047 You'll see a sizable drop in our total company headcount in our operating statistics. \u2047 This was the result of actions tied to our structural cost initiative and explains the severance costs in the quarter, which were $8.1 million of the $11.2 million. \u2047 Excluding those costs, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 30.4% in the prior year, excluding $6.7 million of costs related to severance, operating expenses were also 30.4% of sales. \u2047 Our results for the quarter reflect the swift cost containment measures we implemented due to COVID-19, including temporary reductions in variable hours, in executive and management salaries, temporary suspension of our 401(k) match, a hiring freeze, and virus-related travel restrictions. \u2047 We've now reversed some, but not all of these temporary actions. \u2047 For example, in our fiscal first quarter, we restored our 401(k) match. \u2047 All of this resulted in earnings per share of $0.94. \u2047 And adjusted for severance and other costs, earnings per share was $1.09. \u2047 Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7. \u2047 We achieved strong free cash flow of $171 million in the fourth quarter. \u2047 A key driver was the $32 million decrease in inventory from last quarter to $543 million. \u2047 This reflects typical contraction in a soft environment, but also maintains levels that support share capture. \u2047 We also benefited from a large reduction in receivables. \u2047 We continue to manage our liquidity very closely. \u2047 Given the stabilizing environment, we paid down over $300 million of our revolving credit facility in August, as well as, $20 million of maturing private placement debt. \u2047 Our total debt as of the end of the fourth quarter was $619 million, comprised primarily of a $250 million balance on our revolving credit facility, $20 million of short-term fixed rate borrowings, and $345 million of long-term, fixed-rate borrowings. \u2047 Cash and cash equivalents were $125 million, so our net debt was $494 million. \u2047 In September and October, we deployed our strong cash flow by paying down another $120 million of our revolving debt. \u2047 Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very healthy. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8. \u2047 Many of you know that over the past couple of years, we've been working hard to reposition MSC from a spot-buy supplier to a mission-critical partner on the plant floor of our industrial customers. \u2047 Our focus now turns to implementing Mission Critical to deliver reaccelerated market share capture and a step change in improving profitability over the next three years. \u2047 We plan to do so with the same sense of urgency that we demonstrated during the pandemic. \u2047 I'll start with reaccelerating market share capture, which is on Slide 9. \u2047 Our target is to outgrow the markets in which we compete by at least 400 basis points over the cycle. \u2047 This market share growth capture is indexed against industrial production or the IP Index. \u2047 Our analysis shows that IP is highly correlated with our growth rate over a cycle and it's a good proxy for the relative health and performance of the end markets that we serve. \u2047 This is shown on Slide 10. \u2047 IP is not perfect over shorter timeframes as the aggregate IP Index includes some of our noncore end markets as well. \u2047 Nonetheless, we're going to use it going forward as our primary benchmark, as it gives us the opportunity to better measure our performance over time. \u2047 This does not mean that sentiment indices, such as the MBI, are no longer important indicators to gauge the state of our markets. \u2047 They are, but they're less indicative of outgrowth or share capture since they're purely sentiment service. \u2047 Competitor and supplier growth rates also remain relevant, but differences in end market and product line exposure result in different levels of market growth for each of us. \u2047 Spread above IP over a cycle is, we believe, the best gauge for outgrowth of our markets. \u2047 Looking over extended periods of time, average IP growth is in the 2% to 3% range. \u2047 So this implies MSC growth of at least 6% to 7% over a cycle. \u2047 We believe that the actions we've taken recently, and those that we're taking now and into the near future, build to this level of outperformance over time. \u2047 At the same time, we think that we can outgrow the market over the nearer term as well. \u2047 And so our goal is to exit fiscal 2021 at roughly 200 basis points above IP. \u2047 Most forecasts indicate a return to low single-digit positive growth for IP and during calendar 2021. \u2047 Adjusting for our fiscal calendar, and assuming that these forecasts are accurate, it would mean that we would expect to be growing in the mid single-digits in our fiscal fourth quarter. \u2047 But that would still be slightly down for the full fiscal '21, taking into account the PPE headwind that we will face primarily in our fiscal third quarter. \u2047 There are five growth priorities that will deliver this above-market growth. \u2047 And none of these should surprise you, given that they're aligned with the work that I've spoken about pre -- previously. \u2047 What you should take away from this discussion, though, is the details within each and the specific actions and investments that we're making to produce measurable returns. \u2047 Let me spend a moment on each one. \u2047 This is the core of our business, a position where we have leadership today and where we think we can widen our lead. \u2047 We will do this by building on our talented team of metalworking specialists through hiring and training. \u2047 We've begun this effort in earnest and plan to add about 25% to our metalworking specialist team over the course of the year. \u2047 We'll also continue adding to our industry-leading product and supplier portfolio, and we'll introduce value-added services to our customers such as MSC MillMax, an exclusive technology that we just brought to market. \u2047 It's a proprietary product that, with a simple tap on a machine, uses data and analytics to optimize our customers' machining operations. \u2047 Early customer response has been very good. \u2047 And more importantly, MSC MillMax is delivering improvements to their operations. \u2047 We're now making it available to all of our customers. \u2047 The second lever, selling the strength of our broad portfolio. \u2047 This encompasses investing in our CCSG or Class C consumables business, leveraging the cross-selling that results from it, and leveraging the programs that we've put in place with those supplier partners who have recently invested with MSC and stepped-up programs. \u2047 Our joint opportunity funnels are growing nicely along each of these dimensions and we are focused on converting those into new business. \u2047 The third lever, expanding our solutions footprint and that includes: vending, VMI, and our growing implant solutions program. \u2047 We're finding that bringing these solutions to our customers consistently produces higher growth, better retention rates, and stronger lifetime value. \u2047 As a result, we're increasing investments into each of them and we're raising our performance expectations. \u2047 Our goal for implant solutions program sales is to double them over the next three years. \u2047 Our fourth lever is digital. \u2047 E-commerce has long been a strength of ours and represents roughly 60% of our sales today. \u2047 However, standing still is not an option and so we're raising the bar on ourselves to produce a better experience for our customers. \u2047 We have hired a new leader, who is staffing a new team with deep digital expertise. \u2047 Their focus will be on our website and on other digital tools that bring us closer to our customers and build higher levels of loyalty and retention. \u2047 This will include a new product information system, a new search engine, a new user experience, and the new front-end transactional engine. \u2047 The fifth lever is diversified customer end markets. \u2047 While the core of the business is selling into"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q4 adjusted earnings per share $1.09.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $1.09.
