{"article": ["They will provide their perspective on Xylem's second-quarter results and our outlook. \u2047 I'll ask that you please keep to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue. \u2047 A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, on August 31. \u2047 Additionally, the call will be available for playback via the investors section of our website under the heading investor events. \u2047 All references will be on an organic or adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated. \u2047 These statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties such as those factors described in Xylem's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent reports filed with the SEC including in our Form 10-Q to report results for the period ending June 30, 2020. \u2047 We have provided you with a summary of our key performance metrics including both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. \u2047 Let me start by expressing my sincere hope that you and everyone close to you are keeping safe and well. \u2047 In hindsight, April turned out to be the low point of the quarter. \u2047 We hope we'll eventually look back and say it was a low point of the pandemic. \u2047 After April, we saw modest improvement in both May and June as demand began to stabilize in our key markets. \u2047 Because our business is global, we were exposed to the pandemic's effects early, and so we've also benefited from our presence in markets that have already begun to recover. \u2047 Back in April, it's fair to say that uncertainty overshadowed both supply and demand outlooks as COVID spread from Asia to Europe and then North America. \u2047 So we felt it responsible to set our second-quarter guidance range intentionally wide to bracket a broad set of scenarios for the macro environment. \u2047 Today, we have far more insight and confidence on the supply side, that's because of one notably positive effect of feeling COVID's impact early. \u2047 It catalyzed early action by our teams. \u2047 Fortunately, we were working from solid financial foundations and a strong position. \u2047 So we were able to focus on adapting to the uncertainty and managing the things under our control. \u2047 In addition to addressing the immediate need, those actions have built a more robust foundation for both the medium and long term. \u2047 I want to make a point of giving credit to my colleagues across Xylem and all of our external partners who made that happen. \u2047 They've shown incredible resolve and resilience to a time that has put excessive demands on everyone. \u2047 I want to credit everyone around the world who's kept the water flowing and kept essential services running despite everything being thrown at them. \u2047 Throughout this period of incredible challenge, they've focused on keeping everyone safe and serving our communities. \u2047 Within Xylem, I want to highlight the work of our supply chain, manufacturing and our distribution team. \u2047 They've kept our customers supplied and serviced with very few interruptions. \u2047 Today, we are up and running across our manufacturing network at greater than 90% availability. \u2047 So while demand side uncertainties continue, our outlook now reflects greater clarity and confidence about supply, putting us in a much better position to guide for the third quarter. \u2047 I also want to recognize the dedication of our commercial teams, despite the challenges of working remotely. \u2047 They drove 10% backlog growth, despite COVID-related macro softness. \u2047 You will have seen our announced wins in Telangana, India and with Anglian Water in the U.K. The Telangana irrigation project is our largest win in the country to date, and we do anticipate it will generate roughly $115 million in revenue over the next two to three years. \u2047 which combines metrology, communications and digital offerings, is expected to deliver revenues of roughly $90 million over the course of the project. \u2047 These wins are further evidence of the durability of our business, even in challenging times. \u2047 Because of the differentiation of our portfolio and the resilience of our teams, we expect we will have more news to share about additional big wins when we deliver our third quarter results. \u2047 Clearly, I'm very pleased that the team's hard work is evidenced both operationally and commercially. \u2047 Having said that, the outlook for the second half is still not back normal. \u2047 Therefore, we are not reinstating full-year guidance. \u2047 Conditions are improving in a number of our key markets, but the shape of the COVID curve overall is still unpredictable. \u2047 Now, I'd like to hand over to Mark to provide some detail in the second quarter, and then we'll come back to our outlook and the trends we see emerging through this period. \u2047 Mark, over to you. \u2047 Our revenue in the quarter declined 12% which was better than we anticipated coming out of the first quarter. \u2047 As Patrick mentioned, our revenue and orders performance improved throughout the quarter with a very strong month in June. \u2047 Geographically, U.S. revenues declined 15% as our businesses felt the impact of site shutdowns and project deployment delays. \u2047 Emerging markets were down 15% driven largely by the lockdowns in the Middle East and India. \u2047 Notably, China grew 6% in the quarter as the utility end market returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels, and industrial and commercial businesses began to modestly recover. \u2047 Europe was also a relative bright spot for us as revenues declined a modest 3%. \u2047 Western Europe which is the majority of our European revenue base was down mid-single digits. \u2047 However, our business in Eastern Europe grew double digits. \u2047 This has been a region we've been very focused on, and I want to highlight the tremendous work our team has done there. \u2047 They have quietly but consistently delivered a revenue CAGR of mid-teens growth over the last five years. \u2047 Orders declined 9% in the quarter, while total backlog grew 10% driven by the large Signature deals Patrick mentioned earlier. \u2047 Backlog shippable in 2020 is down 1%. \u2047 However, backlog shippable after 2020 is up 23% which gives us confidence that we'll be emerging from 2020 in a position of strength with a solid foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Operating margin was 9.3% in the quarter which I'll review in more detail by segment shortly. \u2047 Based on our experience in China, we entered the second quarter cautious of COVID potential impacts on our supply chain. \u2047 However, based on those learnings and the great work of our global supply chain teams, we successfully managed through the COVID challenges and turned those learnings into a competitive advantage. \u2047 Our teams quickly adapted and began to work in new ways with our customers, our suppliers and internally, enabling us to deliver earnings per share of $0.40, an achievement punctuated by commercial savvy, operational excellence, cost discipline and a focus on what really matters. \u2047 Water Infrastructure orders grew 7%, and total backlog grew 24% in the quarter. \u2047 This performance was largely driven by the $115 million deal we won in India which is expected to deliver revenue beginning late this year and over the next three years. \u2047 Shippable backlog for the remainder of 2020 is up 5%. \u2047 Segment revenue declined 8% in the quarter and was significantly impacted by declines in the dewatering, industrial and construction rental business. \u2047 As we noted last quarter, we expect utilities to continue to remain resilient as they focus on maintaining their critical infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment. \u2047 This was certainly true this past quarter as our wastewater transport business declined only 4%. \u2047 To date, we've seen wastewater capital projects continue with minimal delays. \u2047 This was an important driver of the strong quarter from our treatment business which grew 7%. \u2047 While U.S. sales were impacted by double-digit declines in the dewatering business, Western Europe revenues were flat in the quarter, showing resilience and some early signs of recovery, especially with our utility customers. \u2047 As we continue to feel the near-term impacts from COVID-19 across the emerging markets, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects for the water sector. \u2047 The Chinese and Indian governments, for example, have expressed their ongoing commitment to continued investments in infrastructure for clean drinking water, wastewater treatment and environmental protection. \u2047 Operating margin in the quarter was 16.2%, contracting on lower volumes and unfavorable mix impacts from dewatering partially offset by productivity, cost savings and price. \u2047 The applied water segment's orders declined 17% in the quarter, while revenue declined 13% as site restrictions continue to impact customers across industrial, commercial and residential end markets. \u2047 As regions begin to reopen, we're seeing modest recovery in our book and ship business in both commercial and industrial markets. \u2047 We also had a strong quarter in the North American ag business driven by dry weather conditions. \u2047 Total segment backlog grew 1% in the quarter. \u2047 Geographically, both the United States and emerging markets revenue declined 14%. \u2047 However, we saw demand in China begin to recover, growing 2% in the quarter. \u2047 Industrial and Commercial end markets in China have been slower to recover than utilities, and our customers are indicating that it may take several months to fully recover in those end markets. \u2047 Operating margin in the segment was 13.4%. \u2047 Margins contracted primarily due to volume declines and inflation partially offset by 570 basis points of productivity and cost savings as well as 100 basis points of price. \u2047 Measurement and control solutions orders declined 24% in the quarter, and revenue declined 17% as the metrology business slowed due to utility workforce availability and physical distancing requirements including restrictions on approaching or entering residents' homes. \u2047 This is delaying both project deployments and installations of replacement meters. \u2047 We expect order and revenue trends to normalize over the coming months as utility workers are able to safely return to meter replacement and installation. \u2047 Importantly, our bidding pipeline remains strong, and there have been no project cancellations. \u2047 Despite the near-term challenges, we're very encouraged by the large win we announced with Anglian Water in the U.K. The $90 million contract demonstrates the competitiveness of our AMI and digital solutions to drive key international wins. \u2047 This win, and a robust pipeline of AMI opportunities highlight the continued commercial momentum and the differentiated value our offerings bring through our combined digital platform, networking, data analytics and metrology capabilities. \u2047 Total segment backlog grew 3% year over year with backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond up 12%. \u2047 The segment margin performance was primarily driven by the impacts from volume declines on meter replacement activity and project deployment delays stemming from COVID-19, while we continue critical investments to support growth. \u2047 Looking forward, we expect meaningful leverage on the upside as revenue growth drives increased incremental margins from recent large contract wins. \u2047 With continued commercial momentum and growing project backlogs, our MCS segment will be a significant source of revenue growth and margin expansion for the company in 2021 and beyond. \u2047 We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and total liquidity of roughly $2.4 billion driven by the $1 billion green bond offering we issued in June as well as strong cash flow performance in the quarter. \u2047 The green bond offering was opportunistic enabling us to lock in longer maturities at historically low rates while effectively prefunding $600 million of maturities due in October 2021 at an after-tax cost of less than 1%. \u2047 This offering was also the latest example of the importance of linking our financing strategy to our sustainability goals. \u2047 Given the strength of our financial position and liquidity, I'll take a moment to note that our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. \u2047 Alongside funding organic investments in key strategic areas, M&A remains a top priority. \u2047 And we maintain a healthy pipeline of opportunities which we closely monitor. \u2047 Now turning to cash flow. \u2047 Our performance in the quarter was very strong. \u2047 Operating cash flow improved roughly 50% year over year in our free cash flow of $137 million, more than doubled from the prior year. \u2047 This was driven by the continued focus and discipline around working capital, the timing of payment on taxes and the prioritization of our capital spend which was $44 million in the quarter, down almost 30% from the prior year. \u2047 Working capital as a percentage of sales improved 110 basis points year over year as our teams continue to drive hard on collections and payment terms while managing inventories in a very challenging demand environment. \u2047 I'm pleased with our overall cash performance through the first half of the year, and we now expect free cash flow conversion for this year will be at least 100%. \u2047 And with that, I'll hand it back to Patrick. \u2047 The end market dynamics we anticipate going into the third quarter are consistent with what we saw in Q2. \u2047 Utilities have remained relatively resilient as expected. \u2047 However, there is significant divergence between wastewater and clean water. \u2047 As Mark mentioned, our wastewater business was down only modestly. \u2047 We're seeing continued opex spending to service mission-critical needs and continued execution of capital projects with approved funding. \u2047 On the clean water side, the short-term declines were steeper. \u2047 They were in the mid-teens. \u2047 We are seeing some project delays, but not cancellations, and we do expect execution to pick back up when physical distancing requirements ease. \u2047 And we've had some very impressive wins, reflective of healthier long-term trends. \u2047 There is considerable discussion about the U.S. utilities capex budgets going into 2021. \u2047 We do expect modest capex softening in the U.S. utilities, but as a leading indicator, we are not seeing a slowdown in our bidding pipeline for capital projects. \u2047 It is worth noting for a broader context that only 8% of our overall revenue is tied to U.S. utilities capex. \u2047 By contrast, opex represents 70% of our overall U.S. utilities revenue, and it remains resilient. \u2047 In addition, we see healthy multiyear trends in both opex and capex in emerging markets, Europe and the rest of the world. \u2047 Turning now to industrial and commercial end markets. \u2047 Industrial didn't slow as much in the second quarter as originally feared, but it will remain soft while facilities continue to deal with restricted access. \u2047 Commercial has lagged industrial, and the book and ship business will remain vulnerable in COVID-19 hotspots. \u2047 Our backlog remains robust. \u2047 Those distributors who destock in the face of uncertainty are beginning to rebuild their inventory. \u2047 We see these end market trends fairly consistent across emerging and developing markets, but it's clear that China and Europe are showing more resilience in the U.S. as they emerge sooner from the pandemic. \u2047 China's recovery which was up 6% in the second quarter is a strong indicator. \u2047 is still grappling with the pandemic's impact, we remain appropriately cautious. \u2047 Now please turn ahead to Slide 12. \u2047 It's worth noting a few trends that we're seeing more broadly across the sector. \u2047 First, there are"], "gold_summary": ["xylem q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.40.  \u2047  q2 adjusted earnings per
