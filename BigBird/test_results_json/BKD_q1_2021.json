{"article": ["Joining us today are Cindy Baier, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Swain, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 These statements are made as of today's date and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update these statements in the future. \u2047 I direct you to the release for the full safe harbor statement. \u2047 For reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure from the most comparable GAAP measure, I direct you to the release and supplemental information which may be found at Brookdale.com/investor, and was furnished on an 8-K yesterday. \u2047 I am pleased that occupancy began to grow by the end of the first quarter and continued in April. \u2047 For the last year, we have been in the toughest battle in the company's history. \u2047 We have been fighting for the health and well-being of our residents, patients and associates. \u2047 While the battle is not over, we have created and implemented highly effective tools to help us reduce COVID-19 cases, including hosting thousands of vaccination clinics in our communities. \u2047 So our residents, patients and associates could receive the lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines. \u2047 Together our frontline, regional and corporate associates stepped up and rapidly executed a series of carefully considered actions to do everything we could to support those who live in, or served by and work within our communities and agencies. \u2047 I'm especially grateful to our associates who recently led through the historic ice storms in Texas. \u2047 I'm so proud of everything you have accomplished. \u2047 The genuine affection for our associates and the gratitude that you expressed means a great deal to us. \u2047 We are also beyond grateful for the scientists who created the vaccines, the people that produce them, the government agencies who prioritize shot for our community, residents and associates, as well as CVS Health, Public Health Departments and other pharmacy partners who helped administer these life saving vaccines. \u2047 With more Americans vaccinated every day, we're hopeful the end of the pandemic is within sight. \u2047 And I am proud of Brookdale's unique and vital role during this crisis. \u2047 Let's review our journey. \u2047 Just over a year ago we closed all of our communities to non-essential guests to help protect against the novel coronavirus that was ravaging the country and the world. \u2047 Today, I'm thrilled that all of our communities have reopened to loved ones. \u2047 We have resumed many of our resident's favorite group activities and social events. \u2047 You can feel a renewed sense of hope and vitality in our communities. \u2047 We believe that the COVID-19 vaccines are critically important in changing our business trends. \u2047 Early on we realized the importance of vaccines and we took a leadership role in successfully advocating for priority vaccine access for assisted living residents and associates and worked closely with public and private officials to improve the vaccine rollout. \u2047 I am incredibly proud of Brookdale's herculean effort to schedule the clinics and educate individuals within our communities at lightening fast speeds. \u2047 Through unwavering perseverance in less than four months, we hosted at least three clinics in every one of our communities and over 125,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered to our residents and associates. \u2047 With 93% of our residents benefiting from the protection of these life saving vaccine, we have made a significant positive impact in helping our nation's seniors reduce their chances of contracting COVID-19. \u2047 I believe our relentless focus on making vaccines available as quickly as possible saved many lives. \u2047 The benefit of the vaccine clinics is already reflected in the 97% decline of resident COVID-19 cases in our communities since the peak in mid-December. \u2047 With the high vaccination rate. \u2047 we believe that we have broken the link with COVID-19 case trends in the metropolitan areas surrounding our communities. \u2047 Our 695 communities across the country, combined have an incredibly small number of current cases. \u2047 We are pleased with these results, yet we remain diligent with our science-based approach to help protect our communities through PPE use, cleaning protocols and other best practices. \u2047 As always, the health and well-being of our residents and associates is our top priority. \u2047 Let me turn to our financial highlights for the first quarter. \u2047 We continued to deliver sequential move-in improvement every month since November. \u2047 Move-ins increased 29% from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. \u2047 This is significant progress, particularly in light of the fact that the first quarter started with the pandemic's third wave ravaging the nation. \u2047 Our sales force transformation is delivering results. \u2047 The team is driving positive momentum with leads and visits increasing sequentially. \u2047 I'm proud our sales associates are attracting many seniors to Brookdale, so that we can help more people navigate the challenges of aging. \u2047 In March, net move-ins and move-outs, also known as MIMO turned positive. \u2047 What is especially exciting about March is that the net MIMO was positive in each of our three senior living segments. \u2047 This is the first positive net MIMO since before the pandemic began. \u2047 I am delighted that we concluded March with sequential occupancy growth and we accomplished this while maintaining rate discipline. \u2047 We continue to focus on driving occupancy improvement and our profitable growth strategy. \u2047 Now turning to an update on government grants. \u2047 To date, providers have been able to request funding for COVID-19 expenses and lost revenue for the first and second quarters of 2020. \u2047 The Provider Relief Fund portal has not yet opened to submit third and fourth quarter 2020 requests. \u2047 When the portal opens, we are prepared to file our request as soon as possible. \u2047 We are grateful that the bipartisan Senate letter to HHS signed by a full quarter of the Senate requested a portion of the remaining Provider Relief Fund to be dedicated to senior living. \u2047 In addition, 59 representatives signed the Companion House letter. \u2047 As the largest senior living operator, we will continue to be an advocate for the senior living industry, reinforcing the vital role our industry plays in the healthcare continuum and it's critical role to help protect a vulnerable population. \u2047 Starting with our Health Care Services. \u2047 The transaction to sell a majority stake of Brookdale Health Care Services to HCA Healthcare continues to be on track for a mid-year closing. \u2047 Our teams are working well together on the transition plan and we remain excited about the benefits of this transaction for our residents and patients. \u2047 When the transaction closes, we expect to receive approximately $300 million in net cash proceeds which will strengthen Brookdale's liquidity position. \u2047 For our senior living business, we are seeing the first green shoots of growth. \u2047 Demand for our communities is returning and gaining momentum. \u2047 Independent market research showed unaided awareness for Brookdale is 2.5 times higher than that of the a next identified competitor. \u2047 Our sales force transformation is taking hold, as seen in our sequential move-in growth every month since November. \u2047 With our recent occupancy growth and net MIMO results, we believe that we are at a positive inflection point. \u2047 On a sequential basis, we expect growth in the second quarter and stronger growth in the third quarter. \u2047 While we can't tell you the exact timing of the recovery based on our recent experience and with a dramatically lower construction starts and the accelerating demographic tailwind, I am confident that demand will continue to improve. \u2047 I am very optimistic about our future. \u2047 Our business at its core is providing high quality needs based services for a rapidly growing senior population. \u2047 We enable seniors to spend more time doing the things that give their life meaning and provide joy by helping them manage the challenges of aging. \u2047 We will continue to make the best of our leadership position, especially with our clinical and operational expertise. \u2047 There are three takeaways related to first quarter results. \u2047 Occupancy inflected positive in March and the positive growth continued in April. \u2047 We maintained rate discipline with our pricing strategy and we continue to face a challenging labor environment. \u2047 However, as occupancy grows, margins will improve based on operating leverage. \u2047 Let me provide context for the three highlights, starting with occupancy. \u2047 Looking back to January of this year, the country including our industry felt the pressure of the third wave resurgence. \u2047 Even so, we are pleased with the strengthening move-ins during the first quarter and into April. \u2047 With the benefit of our communities completing 100% of first vaccine clinics in February, our occupancy decline rapidly moderated. \u2047 In March, net move-ins and move-outs or net MIMO turn positive for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic and by March month end, occupancy had turn positive on a sequential basis. \u2047 While COVID-19-related occupancy losses that occurred over the past year will have a negative impact on year-over-year comparisons, the positive net MIMO in March was an important milestone. \u2047 Turning to rate or RevPOR, the first quarter was 2.9% higher year-over-year and 3.3% higher on a sequential same-community basis. \u2047 For most of our communities, our annual price increase took effect at the beginning of the year. \u2047 The rate increases will help mitigate higher labor costs and lower occupancy. \u2047 While market conditions remain dynamic, we have balanced rate discipline with targeted discounting to respond to the competitive environment in specific markets. \u2047 The third key highlight is opex. \u2047 On a same community basis, the first quarter senior housing operating expense improved 1% year-over-year. \u2047 The primary driver of the favorability was from variable costs, such as supplies and food, and it was a linked to lower occupancy levels that occurred as we progressed through 2020. \u2047 The variable cost favorability more than offset higher wage rates resulting from the difficult labor environment and incremental work and staffing related to the pandemic. \u2047 Let me briefly discuss our Health Care Services segment results. \u2047 The revenue decrease was mainly impacted by the pandemic with fewer services within our communities due to lower occupancy along with the impact of the severe winter storm in Texas. \u2047 To mitigate a significant portion of the revenue loss, the team continued their strong cost controls, matching their operating expenses to the current business and payment model. \u2047 For senior housing and Health Care Services combined in the first quarter of this year, we recognized $11 million of CARES Act related income. \u2047 $9 million was for the employee retention credit associated with wages paid through the end of September 2020 along with approximately $2 million related to government grants. \u2047 As Cindy mentioned, we look for HHS to provide an updates on the use of the remaining Provider Relief Fund and the opportunity to submit request to mitigate second half 2020 COVID-related expenses and lost revenue. \u2047 Turning to G&A, over the past few years, we took actions to reduce our G&A costs to match our smaller community footprint. \u2047 The last significant transaction was related to the Healthpeak unconsolidated CCRC venture completed in the first quarter 2020. \u2047 This transaction delivered that the majority of our year-over-year G&A reduction as well as tighter controls on G&A costs. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2021 was $35 million compared to $185 million for the prior year quarter, of which $100 million was from the one-time management termination fee related to the Healthpeak transaction, I just mentioned. \u2047 The other major driver of lower adjusted EBITDA is lower revenue due to the pandemic. \u2047 Adjusted free cash flow was $56 million lower in the first quarter compared to the prior year period. \u2047 Two items helped to mitigate the impact of lower EBITDA. \u2047 The working capital change was a benefit of $49 million. \u2047 This favorability was mainly due to lower accounts payable payments and timing of payroll. \u2047 Non-development capex was $33 million lower than the prior year due to timing of elective projects. \u2047 Turning to liquidity, as of March 31st, total liquidity was $439 million compared to $575 million at year-end. \u2047 The $137 million change was primarily from $67 million of infrequent items, including pay down of debt and letters of credit and our annual insurance funding, $51 million of negative adjusted free cash flow and $19 million of ongoing debt principal payments. \u2047 As I described last quarter, the expected sale of our Health Care Services segment will provide approximately $300 million of liquidity and will be reported as net cash provided by investing activities. \u2047 To wrap-up, let me share high level comments about the second quarter 2021. \u2047 With our recent occupancy growth, we believe we are at a positive inflection point. \u2047 On a sequential basis, we expect growth in the second quarter and stronger growth in the third quarter. \u2047 In the second quarter, we expect a sizable step down in COVID-related expenses due to the low number of active cases in our communities. \u2047 We anticipate capex projects will accelerate in the second quarter now that our communities are open and we expect to see continued move-in growth. \u2047 Annual non-development capex investment remains at approximately $140 million for 2021. \u2047 For working capital in 2020, we benefited from two CARES Act programs that require repayment. \u2047 We received accelerated Medicare payments and we elected to defer payment of the employer portion of the social security payroll tax. \u2047 The program balances related to the Health Care Services segment will be deducted from the sale proceeds. \u2047 As of quarter end, these amounts were $84 million. \u2047 The remaining senior housing program balances of $76 million will be paid half in 2021 and half in 2022. \u2047 For Health Care Services, we will continue reporting the results as a segment until the transaction closes, which we expect to occur mid-year, subject to final regulatory approvals. \u2047 Upon the closing of the transaction, the net proceeds of approximately $300 million will strengthen our liquidity position. \u2047 We are encouraged by several leading business indicators. \u2047 Occupancy has inflected to positive growth. \u2047 We maintained rate discipline through the toughest part of the pandemic and expect our pricing strategy will continue to provide benefits in the future. \u2047 Construction has decidedly slowed. \u2047 For instance, according to NIC assisted living units under construction is at a six-year low. \u2047 When looking within 20 minutes of Brookdale's owned and leased portfolio, construction starts have dropped 80% from the peak. \u2047 The current low construction starts will provide a tailwind for several years. \u2047 The upcoming baby boomer opportunity is strong with nearly 1 million potential new residents starting within a year. \u2047 And we are seeing increasing needs based demand from higher acuity care where 75% of residents are diagnosed with at least two chronic diseases. \u2047 I'm incredibly proud of our associates and cannot express the depth of my admiration for their tremendous dedication. \u2047 They have focused on what matters most, enriching the lives of those we serve, our residents, patients and their families. \u2047 We are coming through the pandemic with grit and determination and it puts a smile on all of our faces to have begun a new year that promises a return to enrichment and growth in our communities. \u2047 "],
