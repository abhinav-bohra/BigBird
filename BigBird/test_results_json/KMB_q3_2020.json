{"article": ["That release has further information about these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. \u2047 Organic sales increased 3% with good underlying momentum and benefits from increased demand related to COVID-19. \u2047 We significantly increased our growth investments and improved our market positions. \u2047 We had another strong quarter of achieving cost savings and returning cash to shareholders. \u2047 And finally, while earnings were down as expected, we are increasing our full-year outlook. \u2047 Now let's look at the details of our results, starting with sales. \u2047 Our third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion. \u2047 That's up 1% from year ago and includes a two-point drag from currency rates. \u2047 Volumes were up 2% and the combined impact of changes in net selling prices and product mix increased sales by 1%. \u2047 By segment, organic sales rose 10% in Consumer Tissue and 5% in Personal Care, but declined 15% in K-C Professional. \u2047 Mike will talk more about our top-line and our market share performance in just a few minutes. \u2047 Moving on to profitability. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.2%, up 40 basis points year-on-year. \u2047 Adjusted gross profit increased 2%. \u2047 We had excellent cost savings performance in the quarter. \u2047 Combined savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs totaled $140 million, including continued strong productivity improvements. \u2047 Commodities were a benefit of $25 million in the quarter driven by pulp and other raw materials. \u2047 Other manufacturing costs were higher year-on-year that included incremental costs related to COVID-19. \u2047 Foreign currencies were also a headwind reducing operating profit by a high single digit rate in the quarter. \u2047 Moving further down the P&L. \u2047 Between the lines spending was 18.9% of sales. \u2047 That's up 180 basis points and driven by a big step up in digital advertising. \u2047 G&A also increased including capability-building investments and higher incentive compensation expenses. \u2047 We expect between the lines spending will rise further sequentially in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our SG&A spending is typically high in the fourth quarter and this year we'll also have project activities that were temporarily delayed because of COVID-19. \u2047 All in all, for the fourth quarter-for the third quarter, sorry, adjusted operating profit was down 6% and operating margin was 17.2%, down 130 basis points versus year ago. \u2047 By segment, operating margins were up in Consumer Tissue and Healthy and Personal Care. \u2047 K-C Professional margins were down significantly, including an approximate 600 basis-point drag from fixed costs under absorption. \u2047 On the bottom-line, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 in the quarter, compared to $1.84 in the year-ago period. \u2047 Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. \u2047 Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $559 million compared to $886 million in the year-ago quarter. \u2047 The decrease was as expected and driven by the timing of tax payments and higher working capital. \u2047 We continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. \u2047 Third quarter dividends and share repurchases totaled approximately $560 million. \u2047 And for the full year, we expect the total will be $2.15 billion. \u2047 So let me now turn to the full year. \u2047 The overall headline is that we're raising our top and bottom-line outlook. \u2047 On the top-line, we now expect organic sales growth of 5% compared to our prior target of 4% to 5%. \u2047 Through nine months, organic sales are up nearly 6% and we expect a solid fourth quarter. \u2047 On average, we expect slightly less headwinds from currency rates than previously anticipated. \u2047 In addition, we'll begin consolidating the Softex Indonesia business into our results on November 1 on a one-month lag. \u2047 All in all, we expect net sales will grow 2% to 3% this year. \u2047 That's one point better than our previous estimate. \u2047 On the bottom-line, our new outlook is for adjusted earnings per share of $7.50 to $7.65. \u2047 That represents year-on-year growth of 9% to 11%. \u2047 Our prior outlook was for adjusted earnings per share of $7.40 to $7.60. \u2047 The increase in our outlook is driven by improved top line, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense and other manufacturing costs. \u2047 Overall, I'm encouraged that we're improving our near-term outlook and investing significantly in the business for longer-term growth. \u2047 I'll begin by reinforcing that we remain focused on three near-term priorities that we established since the outbreak of COVID-19. \u2047 First, we're focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and our consumers. \u2047 Second, we're proactively managing our supply chain to ensure supply of our essential products. \u2047 And third, we're prudently managing the business through near-term volatility, while continuing to strengthen the long-term health of Kimberly Clark. \u2047 Our 40,000 employees continue to do heroic work in this COVID environment. \u2047 Our supply chain operations have remained online with strong productivity gains and fewer COVID-related disruptions over the last three months. \u2047 The environment is still dynamic and we're closely monitoring virus hotspots. \u2047 And thus far, our supply chain has been resilient and our teams have done a great job overcoming daily challenges. \u2047 Now turn to our results focusing on organic sales category conditions and our market shares. \u2047 As Maria mentioned, organic sales increased 3% in the quarter. \u2047 In North American consumer products, organics sales rose 8%. \u2047 Now within that Personal Care grew 6% driven by broad-based volume growth in baby and child care. \u2047 We improved our market shares on diapers, baby wipes, and in child care. \u2047 In late July, we launched Pull-Ups New Leaf training pants which features super-soft natural materials and is our most premium training pants. \u2047 This is another example of our elevate the core strategy and action. \u2047 And New Leaf is off to a very good start. \u2047 In North American consumer tissue, organic sales increased to 11% and that reflects strong demand due to the COVID-19 work from home environment and strong momentum on Kleenex facial tissue. \u2047 Bathroom tissue shipments benefited from our efforts to restore customer inventory levels. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we expect more benefit from those efforts and from people continuing to spend more time at home. \u2047 Our market share performance in North American consumer products was strong in the third quarter; shares were upper even in six of eight categories. \u2047 Turning to K-C Professional North America, organic sales declined 15%. \u2047 Sales were down about 35% in washroom products. \u2047 And as you'd expect, the category has been significantly impacted. \u2047 There are fewer people working in offices and lower levels of business activity, including in travel and lodging. \u2047 Sales were a bit better in September, but we're planning for only a modest near-term improvement in the environment. \u2047 On the other hand, KCP sales were up double digits in wipers, safety and other products. \u2047 Our efforts to expand our face mask business by leveraging our superior non-wovens technology is off to a good start. \u2047 We're also expanding our wipers line-up with Scott 24-Hour, which delivers long-lasting surface protection from bacteria. \u2047 Moving to D&E markets, organic sales were up 2% that was driven by 7% growth in Personal Care. \u2047 In terms of key personal care markets, organic sales were up mid-teens in China, mid-single digits in both Latin America and Eastern Europe and strong double-digits in India. \u2047 Organic sales were down mid-single digits in ASEAN. \u2047 We also improved our market shares in many countries in the quarter. \u2047 And that includes Brazil, China, throughout Eastern Europe, India, and Peru. \u2047 While category conditions remain difficult in many D&E countries, government restrictions on social mobility and store operations have eased somewhat since the last quarter. \u2047 Finally, in developed markets, organic sales were up 3% driven by strong growth in consumer tissue. \u2047 Looking ahead, we're launching Kleenex Proactive Care in the UK and other markets in EMEA. \u2047 This lineup includes hand towels, anti-bacterial hand and face wipes, sanitizing gel, and face masks. \u2047 Now in terms of market share performance, we continue to make good progress. \u2047 We're on track to grow or maintain share in approximately 60% of the 80 category/country combinations that we track. \u2047 This is a result of higher investment levels, innovations, and strong in-market executions. \u2047 Our capabilities are driving our results and our investments are working hard for us. \u2047 Through nine months, I'm very encouraged with our performance, how we're navigating this environment and how our teams are taking care of each other and our customers. \u2047 Before closing, I'd like to comment on our recent acquisition of Softex. \u2047 This transaction is a strong strategic fit with our focus on accelerating growth in personal care in D&E markets. \u2047 Softex expands our presence in a high-growth market where we had limited exposure. \u2047 The diaper market in Indonesia is already the sixth largest in the world, and that's projected to nearly triple in size over the next decade. \u2047 Our Softex team has built a strong business with deep local market knowledge, excellent brands and market positions and strong profitability. \u2047 This transaction improves our underlying growth prospects, and we're looking forward to leveraging our combined strengths in innovation, marketing, and go-to-market. \u2047 In conclusion, we're managing through the COVID environment safely and effectively. \u2047 We remain optimistic about our opportunities to generate long-term growth and create shareholder value. \u2047 We're investing in our brands and improving our market positions. \u2047 We are raising our full-year outlook and are on track to achieve excellent financial results. \u2047 And we continue to operate our business with a balanced and sustainable approach as we execute K-C strategy 2022. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname announces q3 adjusted earnings per share $1.72.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share
