{"article": ["Bill Bayless, Chief Executive Officer; Jim Hopke, President; Jennifer Beese, Chief Operating Officer; William Talbot, Chief Investment Officer; Daniel Perry, Chief Financial Officer; Kim Voss, Chief Accounting Officer; and Jamie Wilhelm, our EVP of Public-Private Partnerships. \u2047 As you know, Q3 encompasses the completion of the prior academic year, which was substantially impacted by the onset of the COVID pandemic and the commencement of the new academic year. \u2047 Let me start by saying that we are pleased with the start of the 2020-2021 academic year. \u2047 As Jennifer, William, and Daniel will discuss, the resiliency of the modern student housing industry, operationally, financially, and from an industry fundamentals perspective, is once again being demonstrated as we transition into the new academic year amid the COVID pandemic. \u2047 While our business has not fully normalized at this time, we believe we are on the road to recovery as exemplified in many areas. \u2047 Our lease-up occupancy exceeded 90%, a level many believe to be a best-case scenario in the early days of this pandemic. \u2047 Our rent collection rate improved to 97% in September, the first full month of the new academic year in most of our markets, from approximately 94% in Q2. \u2047 This improvement taking place, while many other sectors continue to experience decreasing trends at this time. \u2047 We're also receiving significantly fewer resident hardship rent abatement request. \u2047 Several hundred currently versus several thousand per month in the prior academic year. \u2047 We have also definitively witnessed the strong consumer sentiment regarding students' desires to be in the college environment with their peers regardless of University's curriculum delivery methodology, whether it being online, in-person, or a hybrid combination. \u2047 And our university partners have planned and implemented prudent strategies. \u2047 It appears to have provided stability and ongoing on-campus occupancies. \u2047 As we are not currently holding any discussions for on-campus rental refunds beyond one university partner, which we expect to total only $1 million -- approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter versus the $15 million we contributed in the second quarter of the prior academic year. \u2047 Also, as William will discuss, in ACC's Tier one university markets, there appears to be enrollment stability amid the pandemic. \u2047 Even amid this black swan event, the resounding value of a college degree and abundant demand for higher education at Power five and Carnegie R1 research institutions continues underpinning the stability and consistent growth opportunity in our sector. \u2047 Finally, as part of our ongoing commitment to the Hi, How Are You Project, whose mission is to remove the stigma associated with mental illness and to encourage discussion regarding mental health and well-being. \u2047 We jointly conducted a mental health survey at our communities in conjunction with the commencement of the new academic year to better understand the mindsets during COVID-19. \u2047 The survey received responses from over 12,000 of our residents. \u2047 This is one of the largest surveys of its kind, specifically examining college student's perspectives about COVID and how it has impacted their mental health. \u2047 Not surprising, according to the survey, 85% of respondents are more stressed as a result of the global pandemic. \u2047 Also worth noting, the top three items students are missing most are: one, socializing with their friends; two, participating in in-class instruction; and three, attending events both on and off-campus. \u2047 Encouragingly, the results also reveal students believe that their mental health is just as important as their physical health, and they're open to having dialogue to help themselves and others. \u2047 We'll continue to promote the mission of the Hi, How Are You Project, and promote discussion around mental well-being among our student residents through our Residence Life programs, as we hope to have a meaningful impact in this very important endeavor. \u2047 We are excited to get the 2020-2021 academic year under way with September representing its first full month. \u2047 Based on our leasing activity, it is now evident that the vast majority of our students desire to be with their peers in their college environment regardless of the curriculum delivery method at their universities. \u2047 Our modern, well-located, fully amenitized apartment communities offer students the ability to continue to thrive despite the current COVID environment. \u2047 Turning to Page S6 of the supplemental. \u2047 As usual, our third quarter includes a mix of two academic years, with prior academic year leases expiring mid-quarter and new academic year leases commencing in August and September. \u2047 While the prior year academic year results were heavily influenced by COVID, in the new academic year we are seeing an improving financial trajectory. \u2047 During the quarter, we provided $2.1 million in rent refunds to on-campus residents at one ACE Partnership University, which we expect to decrease to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter. \u2047 This is in comparison to the $15 million provided to residents that are primarily on-campus residence halls in the second quarter. \u2047 As noted in our release, no additional refunds are in discussion at this time. \u2047 With regard to students and parents being impacted by COVID-19, we instituted our Resident Hardship Program during the second quarter where we provided over $8 million of financial assistance. \u2047 During the current quarter, the amount totaled $4.7 million, with the majority of this amount relating to our prior academic year leases. \u2047 In September, based on significantly lower levels of requests within the program, we gave approximately $175,000 in direct rent relief during the month. \u2047 In regards to collections, we had a 97% collection rate on our rent charge for September, a significant improvement from the 93.7% seen during the second quarter. \u2047 As expected, our third quarter other income was impacted by $8.4 million due to the loss of summer camp conference business, the continued waiver of online transaction fees and late payment fees, and higher levels of bad debt. \u2047 Going into the fourth quarter, we will continue to be impacted to some degree as we work on reinstituting leasing and payment fees. \u2047 With regard to same-store opex, we were able to partially offset lost revenue with savings and operating expenses of 5.2%, led by savings in all of our controllable categories. \u2047 We continue to have lower G&A costs due to the cancellation of nonessential travel, savings, and maintenance as we were able to turn more of our units in-house, lower marketing expenses due to substantially fewer in-person promotional and marketing events, and lower payroll costs associated with adjusted staffing and less overtime during the pandemic. \u2047 After executing successful touchless, digital, and physically distant move-ins at our properties across the country, our sanitization plan procedures continues. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, at our owned properties, our resident's physical health has been minimally impacted by the COVID virus. \u2047 In the current academic year, residents have reported a total of approximately 1,500 positive COVID-19 cases or 1.7% of our occupied beds. \u2047 At this time, we are tracking only 110 active cases or 0.1% of our occupied beds. \u2047 It is also worth noting that both the CDC and Dr. Fauci have urged universities to not send students back home to their primary residents if at all possible, to eliminate the risk of scattering students throughout the country and putting them in contact with parents and family that may be in a higher risk category. \u2047 We are pleased to see that universities have successfully implemented their operational protocols. \u2047 Work through the initial spikes in cases, seeing cases decline, and several have recently announced plans for expanded in-person activities in the spring. \u2047 Turning to our leasing results on Page S9 of the supplemental. \u2047 As of September 30, our 2020-2021 same-store portfolio was 90.3% leased, with in-place rents growing 1.1% over prior year. \u2047 However, as you will see in the chart, we gained approximately 300 additional leases at our properties that primarily serve sophomores and above, which offsets the decreasing at our properties, primarily serving first year students as our university partners finalize their move-in in assignment processes. \u2047 We continue to see fall leasing activity at our off-campus communities, primarily serving sophomores and above. \u2047 The largest opportunity for occupancy gains in the spring is our on-campus ACE property serving first year students, a process which again is administered by university partners. \u2047 Turning first to development. \u2047 We are pleased to have completed construction and delivered two owned ACE developments on the campuses of the University of Southern California Health Sciences in San Francisco State University. \u2047 The developments were completed on time and on budget despite the challenging environment. \u2047 However, initial occupancy at the communities were impacted primarily due to state and university policies in response to COVID-19. \u2047 We still anticipate the projects will stabilize at development yields of 6.25 upon a return to normalcy on each campus. \u2047 In addition, we completed the second phase of our Flamingo Crossings Village project at Walt Disney World. \u2047 With the continued temporary suspension of the Disney College Program, both delivered phases, which totaled 406 units and 1,624 beds remain unoccupied at the current time. \u2047 Given our strong relationship, Disney has agreed to abate all ground rent until the project becomes occupied, and we are actively working with Disney to market and lease the community to the broader rental market, including Walt Disney World cast members. \u2047 The original design of the community and ground lease contemplated the potential leasing of units beyond the DCP program with configurable furniture, attractive individual lease liability options, and an unmatched amenity package in the market. \u2047 Based on recently updated projections provided by Disney, we now do not expect occupancy from DCP participants until the second half of 2021. \u2047 While leasing of the currently available beds to the open market has just commenced and will continue through 2021, based on traditional conventional multifamily absorption versus immediate DCP stabilization as units are brought online, coupled with discount pricing due to the interim nature of these non-DCP leases, we expect short-term diminished economics from the original DCP pro forma projections. \u2047 We anticipate housing both open market renters and DCP participants through at least 2022. \u2047 We continue the construction of the remaining phases of the project to be delivered through May 2023, in anticipation of the full return of the Disney College Program along with leasing to the broader rental market until the DCP program returns to levels that fully occupy the community. \u2047 In our on-campus third-party development business, during the quarter, we commenced construction on a 476-bed development on the campus of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. The project is located on the University's capital campus, just north of the Georgetown Law School, and is expected to be delivered in fall of 2022. \u2047 We expect to earn a total of $3 million in development fees, and we'll manage the project upon completion. \u2047 We continue to make progress on predevelopment efforts at the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Irvine, MIT, Princeton University, West Virginia University, Concordia University, and Virginia Commonwealth University. \u2047 The ultimate timing, finance structure, and project feasibility for these predevelopments have not been finalized at this time. \u2047 With regard to the overall on-campus development environment, we still anticipate the continued increase in on-campus P3 opportunities across the country. \u2047 The occupancy of antiquity communities on-campus have been impacted to a much greater extent, the more modern accommodations offered both on and off-campus. \u2047 And universities will look to modernize their on-campus housing to meet consumer preferences and mitigate against future losses. \u2047 In addition, we anticipate more universities return to off-balance sheet financing structures, including our ACE program, to finance the development of new housing as universities will be focused on conserving their balance sheets and debt capacity in the wake of the effects of COVID-19. \u2047 We are currently tracking a deep pipeline of on-campus opportunities, and American Campus remains in a strong position to capitalize on those opportunities. \u2047 Turning to university enrollment. \u2047 We have been actively tracking fall 2020 enrollment and the potential impact of COVID-19. \u2047 Of the 68 owned markets where ACC currently operates, 85% of universities have reported statistics for the fall. \u2047 Overall, we've seen only a 0.3% decline in enrollment across those 58 markets. \u2047 50% of our universities experienced increased enrollment in fall 2020, with an average increase in students of 2.5%. \u2047 Of the half of our universities that had decreases in enrollment, they only averaged a 3.1% decline for fall 2020. \u2047 First year student enrollment is only down 1.1% for fall. \u2047 As Jennifer discussed, our properties that primarily serve first year students are currently 77% occupied. \u2047 And given there has only been a slight decline in first year student enrollment, we believe there is opportunity to improve occupancies in those projects as first year students may decide to return to the university for the spring semester. \u2047 University enrollment has remained stable despite reduced international students for fall 2020. \u2047 As international students typically constitute less than 10% of enrollment in our portfolio, while demand from domestic students remains deep to replace any loss from international students. \u2047 With 51% of our universities having released fall 2020 international data, there has been a 14% decline in international students. \u2047 Yet those same universities have grown the much larger segment of domestic enrollment by 1.2%. \u2047 Overall, this demonstrates the demand from domestic students at the Tier one universities we serve offset the negative impact from reduced international enrollment. \u2047 The resilient, stable enrollment figures during the pandemic places the Tier one colleges and universities we serve in a strong position for academic year 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Finally, the new supply landscape for next academic year continues to remain favorable. \u2047 Within ACC's 68 markets, we are now tracking 21,150 beds currently under construction for 2021, of a potential additional 400 beds planned, but not yet under construction, reflecting a decline of 2% to 4% in new supply off the current year's decline in new supply of 20%. \u2047 Limited available land close to campus, construction costs, and lack of available construction financing will continue to put downward pressure on future supply in our markets for the next few years. \u2047 As we reported last night, total FFOM for the third quarter of 2020 was $45.2 million or $0.32 per fully diluted share. \u2047 As Jennifer said, despite the unprecedented and ongoing response to the virus, we have all experienced in 2020 and its direct effect on the operating environment of the colleges and universities we serve, we have been pleased with the resiliency the student housing sector has exhibited. \u2047 While the company's near-term earnings will, of course, be affected by the governmental and university actions taken in response to the pandemic, we believe that we are on a path to return to a relative level of normalcy both operationally and financially after achieving over 90% for this fall"], "gold_summary": ["q3 ffo per share $0.32.  \u2047  q3 adjusted ffo per share $0.32."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 ffo per share $0.32.  \u2047  q3 ffo per share $0.32."]}
