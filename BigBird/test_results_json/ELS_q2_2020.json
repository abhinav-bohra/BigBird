\u2047 Our MH properties are currently 95% occupied. \u2047 Our residents are homeowners who have generally paid cash for their home. \u2047 This capital commitment to our communities is an important differentiator in difficult times. \u2047 Our overall occupancy consist of less than 6% renters. \u2047 Moving to our RV business, we have had an acquisition strategy over the years of buying RV resorts that are heavily focused on annual and seasonal revenue streams. \u2047 80% of our RV revenue is longer term in nature and 20% comes from our transient customers. \u2047 In the second quarter, our properties were impacted by local shelter in place orders, which call for reduced or eliminated travel activity inside of jurisdiction. \u2047 Our RV annual customer generally has developed roots with the community. \u2047 For the second quarter, the annual revenue which historically accounts for approximately 70% of our total revenue, grew by 4.7%. \u2047 In the more -- in the quarter, we

late fees as well as fees related to transient RV state. \u2047 Core property operating expenses were flat compared to second quarter 2019. \u2047 The footnote disclosure included in our supplemental

guidelines. \u2047 Our rent deferral program was in place from April through June. \u2047 Through that program, we assisted 540 residents with the deferral of approximately $0.5 million of rent.

command preferred terms from participating lenders. \u2047 Our cash balance after funding our July dividend is more than $50 million. \u2047 We have available capacity of $350 million from our unsecured line of credit, we have approximately $141 million of capacity under our ATM program, and we have no scheduled debt maturities for the next 12 months. \u2047 We continue to place high importance on balance sheet flexibility and we believe we have multiple sources of capital available to us. \u2047 Our interest coverage ratio was 4.9 times and our debt to adjusted EBITDAre is 5 times. \u2047 The weighted average maturity of our outstanding secured debt is 12.5 years. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted ffo per share $0.47.  \u2047  approved about 540 resident
