{"article": ["With us on the call today are Michael Kasbar, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ira Birns, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 If not, you can access the release on our website. \u2047 Before I get started, I would like to review World Fuel's safe harbor statement. \u2047 A description of the risk factors that could cause results to materially differ from these projections can be found in World Fuel's most recent Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u2047 As with prior conference calls, we have set members of the media and individual private investors on the line participate in listen-only mode. \u2047 This is Ira Birns. \u2047 Before Mike begins, operator, we've been informed that we still have music playing while Glenn was speaking. \u2047 Could you please ensure that, that's shut off ASAP before Mike begins? \u2047 We'll be with you in a few minutes. \u2047 Sorry for the delay. \u2047 Can you hear the music? \u2047 So I give us a couple more minutes. \u2047 Our sincere apologies, we're still try to work -- working how with the conference call[Indecipherable] shut off the music. \u2047 We'll be with you in a minute or two. \u2047 I'm not hearing music on my end. \u2047 Is anyone still hearing music? \u2047 Okay, we're back on. \u2047 Sorry for the delay. \u2047 So it's the music, but hopefully, everybody can hear. \u2047 If not please figure out a way to contact us. \u2047 So we're assuming everyone's hearing. \u2047 It's good to be here today. \u2047 As we all know, it's been a year like no other. \u2047 It was a year when our company, our country and the world were challenged in ways never before experienced. \u2047 It was also a year in which we learned a lot about ourselves and each other, about how we respond to emergencies, to rapid change, to having our personal and business lives turned upside down, and the health of our family and employees put at risk. \u2047 The pandemic impacted some businesses more than others. \u2047 Please support the industries that have been among the most impacted. \u2047 The World Fuel was the ultimate stress test, and I could not be more pleased with and proud of the incredible job our global teams did during this extraordinarily challenging year. \u2047 We did not miss a beat for our customers or suppliers in any part of our business activity or in all part of our global operations, not one. \u2047 We absorbed risk, performed our operations with excellence and improved our safety metrics along the way. \u2047 We maintained and enhanced our commercial, operational and financial position as the counterparty of choice to the global aviation marine and land-based industries. \u2047 I could not be more proud of the dedication and efforts of our team and the outcomes they drove in this difficult, risky and volatile year. \u2047 We have been fire-tested and are stronger for it. \u2047 Today, all of our businesses are strong, healthy employees to respond to the resurgence in passenger travel and commercial activity in aviation, marine and land as local and global markets reopen. \u2047 The work that we have done over the year on talent, leadership and culture has better positioned us to execute on delivering and scaling our existing diverse energy and last half-mile logistic solutions to end users. \u2047 Our aviation, marine and land businesses continue to refine and enhance their offerings and expand their global networks. \u2047 We have clearly demonstrated -- they clearly demonstrated there's strategic value in their markets during the most successful -- I'm sorry, stressful time in history. \u2047 Our energy management business continued to evolve its natural gas, power, wind, solar, carbon and renewables activities, and as I said last quarter, this business is breaking into stide. \u2047 We provided robust energy management advisory services to a broad base of locally rolled businesses in 55 countries. \u2047 We sourced renewable energy from our portfolio of 190 renewable power plants. \u2047 We concluded solar power agreements with various communities as well as agreements with utility-scale solar projects for Fortune 500 companies. \u2047 We've managed and sold growing volumes of electricity and natural gas. \u2047 Throughout all of our businesses, we were supporting our clients' pathways to lowering their carbon footprint and meeting their growing ESG agendas by procuring and selling carbon credits, sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. \u2047 As I said last quarter, the reception from the market to our sustainability offerings did accelerate. \u2047 Society has passed the tipping point on climate action, and we are well positioned to serve the sustainability needs of the market. \u2047 Last quarter, I mentioned our generated military activity and the synergy of our commercial activities. \u2047 While our core in-theater business has experienced substantial declines as a result of troop withdrawals in Afghanistan, I am confident we will be building out a more diverse portfolio of business activities within this sector, which leverages our commercial, operational and expeditionary capabilities. \u2047 As I have said in the past, our military activity and expertise has positively influenced our commercial practices. \u2047 And the military veterans that work shoulder to shoulder within their organization continue to help us drive operational excellence. \u2047 We are grateful for your service and contribution to our success, and are committed to hiring and supporting military service members throughout our global organization. \u2047 In addition to participating in what is rapidly moving from an energy transition to an energy revolution, we are also participating in the digital transition. \u2047 We are digitizing more transactions, documents and communications every day and moving hundreds of suppliers and customers to our PPIs and portal solutions, all with the purpose of reducing costs, lowering ours and our customers' and suppliers' partner footprint and increasing the value by improving operational integration with the markets we serve. \u2047 We are taking our large and liquid analog transportation fuel marketplace and turning it into a digital energy ecosystem, and we're doing this with smaller teams and better performance as a function of focusing on diverse talent and thinking, and a collaborative culture. \u2047 In 2020, our global team showed great strength of character, tremendous resilience, uncountered grit and a relentless determination and burning desire to do well. \u2047 Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed the extra music. \u2047 Sorry about that again. \u2047 But before I begin my financial review, I would also like to reiterate Mike's sentiments. \u2047 Last year was one that brought unforeseeable challenges to our business in the markets we serve. \u2047 But we couldn't be prouder of what our company has accomplished in the face of such extraordinary challenges. \u2047 While uncertainty still looms, the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel seems to be creeping a bit closer. \u2047 And we are very confident that our resilience business model will bounce back as the markets we serve begin to recover. \u2047 More positive news is coming out every day regarding vaccination rates and trends in COVID activity and the progress that is being made should be very encouraging to us all. \u2047 I'll provide additional details regarding what we have done to strengthen our company during 2020 as I give a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year financial results. \u2047 As usual, please note that the following figures exclude the impact of nonoperational items as highlighted in our news release. \u2047 The nonoperational income and expense items for the quarter and full year, principally relate to the gain on the sale of our multi-service business, most of which was recorded in the third quarter, as well as our acquisition, divestiture, impairment and restructuring-related expenses. \u2047 Now let's begin with some of the fourth quarter and full year highlights. \u2047 Consolidated volumes for the fourth quarter increased 3.5% sequentially to 3.5 billion gallons. \u2047 For the full year, our consolidated volume was 14.4 billion gallons, that's down approximately 26% compared to 2019, mostly related to the pandemic's impact on our commercial aviation business. \u2047 Adjusted fourth quarter net income and earnings per share were $1 million and $0.02 per share, respectively. \u2047 And adjusted full year net income and earnings per share were $74 million to $1.15 per share for seven weeks. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $45 million in the fourth quarter and $261 million for the full year. \u2047 And lastly, we generated another $114 million of cash flow from operations during the fourth quarter which contributed to a record $604 million of cash flow from operations for the full year, further strengthening our balance sheet amid the ongoing and pandemic. \u2047 And now consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter was $4.7 billion, again, negatively impacted by the continued effects of COVID-19 on our segment volumes as well as a 25% decline in average fuel prices compared to 2019. \u2047 For the full year, consolidated revenue was $20.4 billion that's a decrease of $16.5 million or 45% when compared to 2019, with the decline driven by the same factors as the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our aviation segment volume was 1.1 billion gallons in the fourth quarter, to actually up 12% sequentially, but still well below pre-COVID activity levels. \u2047 Strength in cargo operations and business aviation was offset by continued weakness in global commercial passenger aviation activity. \u2047 Fourth quarter spikes in COVID activity led to a reinstitution of mandated quarantines and other forms of travel restrictions in much of Europe, the Americas and even Asia. \u2047 These restrictions are expected to remain in place for the balance of the first quarter. \u2047 However, COVID cases, hospitalizations and vaccination rates all seem to finally be trending in the right direction, which should begin to result in relaxed travel restrictions. \u2047 This is all leading to growing optimism for a reasonable recovery of commercial aviation activity, potentially beginning as early as sometime during the second quarter and into the third quarter of this year. \u2047 For the full year, volume in our aviation segment was 4.7 billion gallons, that's a 3.8 million gallon decline or 45% compared to 2019, again, for the same obvious reasons. \u2047 Volume in our earnings segment for the fourth quarter was 4.2 million metric tons and approximately 17% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. \u2047 The year-over-year declines were principally driven by weaker demand across the core resale in physical businesses. \u2047 For the full year, our segment filing was 17.5 million metric tons, that's a decline of 3.4 million metric tons or 16% compared to 2019. \u2047 Our land segment volume was 1.3 billion gallons or gallon equivalents during the fourth quarter. \u2047 That's a decrease of only 11% year-over-year and an actual increase of 2% sequentially, generally good results considering the broad economic impact of the pandemic on our markets our land business serves. \u2047 We experienced year-over-year COVID-related volume deployments in our retail, commercial and industrial and wholesale operations, which were partially offset by increases in our drilling power, natural gas and sustainability platform. \u2047 Our land team remains focused on expanding our C&I power and natural gas and sustainability platforms and has done a great job managing our land business through the pandemic over the course of 2020. \u2047 For the full year, volume on our land segment was 5.1 billion gallons, that's a decline of 390 million gallons or 7% compared to 2019. \u2047 And consolidated volumes for the full year was 14.4 billion gallons, down 5.1 billion gallons or 26% year-over-year. \u2047 Consolidated gross profit for the fourth quarter was $165 million, that's a 42% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 23% decrease sequentially. \u2047 For the full year, consolidated gross profit was $852 million, down $260 million or 23%, both declines driven by the impact of the pandemic on our aviation and marine results. \u2047 Our aviation segment contributed $70 million of gross profit in the fourth quarter, down 50% year-over-year and 28% sequentially. \u2047 The reason for the year-over-year decline again is obvious, but we also experienced a sequential decline due in part to renewed travel restrictions in the fourth quarter, as mentioned earlier. \u2047 These restrictions most significantly impacted our iron ore volumes that are serviced by our physical operating network in Europe. \u2047 Also, our inventory business was negatively impacted by fuel price volatility during the quarter, and we also experienced a modest sequential decline in government-related activities related to well pump size Afghanistan troop withdrawals, mandated by the prior U.S. administration. \u2047 As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2021, we anticipate that aviation gross profit will remain flat sequentially, driven principally by continued lockdowns in many parts of Europe and other areas of the world, which, again, we expect will last through the balance of this quarter. \u2047 For the full year, aviation gross profit was $353 million, a decline of $188 million or 36% year-over-year. \u2047 The marine segment generated fourth quarter gross profit of $23 million, a 60% year-over-year decline and a 29% decline sequentially. \u2047 The COVID-related year-over-year decline in core retail activity, including the[Indecipherable] sector, was compounded by a comparison to a very strong fourth quarter in 2019, and which has benefited from the lead out to the January one very[Indecipherable] IMO regulations. \u2047 In addition to seasonality, the sequential decline related to lower margins we expected in our core retail activity and weakness in our physical business, impacted in part by COVID-19. \u2047 As we look ahead to the first quarter, based on what we've experienced year-to-date, we expect marine gross profit to increase sequentially, driven by a rebound in our higher-margin physical business and an increase in customer derivative-related activity. \u2047 For the full year, the marine segment generated $151 million of gross profit, which is down $30 million or 17% compared to 2019. \u2047 Our land segment delivered gross profit of $72 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and 11% sequentially when excluding profitability related to multi-service, which we sold at the end of the third quarter. \u2047 While core domestic activity declined, land experienced sequential increases in our power and gas business as well as the benefit of seasonality in the U.K., again, a good outcome for land considering the impacts of COVID-19 on the markets they serve. \u2047 Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect land gross profit to be sequentially higher, principally related to the increase in activity in the U.K. as we expect people strength in our oil distribution activities, which began in the fourth quarter to continue through the first quarter, driven in part by assumed higher usage as a result of continuing pandemic-related lockdowns. \u2047 And some additional potential upside related to the recent volatility in the natural gas markets in parts in the U.S. For the full year, the land segment contributed gross profit of $348 million, after excluding the impact of multi-service, the land year-over-year decline was only $9"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.02.  \u2047  qtrly revenue $4,702.1 million versus $9,358.1 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q4
