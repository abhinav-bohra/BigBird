{"article": ["This is Matt Eichmann. \u2047 I'm joined by Pete Watson, Greif's president and chief executive officer, Larry Hilsheimer, Greif's chief financial officer, and Ole Rosgaard, Greif's chief operating officer. \u2047 We will take questions at the end of today's call. \u2047 In accordance with regulation fair disclosure, please ask questions regarding issues you consider important because we're prohibited from discussing material, non-public information with you on an individual basis. \u2047 Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up before returning to the queue. \u2047 Actual results could differ materially from those discussed. \u2047 We appreciate your interest in Greif, and hope that you and your families are staying both safe and healthy during the pandemic. \u2047 Greif delivered robust third-quarter results. \u2047 We executed with discipline to deliver record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $238 million and adjusted class A earnings per share of $1.93, fueled by strong volumes and ongoing strategic pricing actions as we continue to experience strong demand across our global portfolio. \u2047 Our leverage ratio fell at 2.8 times, and our board approved a $0.02 and a $0.03 increase to our class A and class B quarterly dividend, respectively, payable on October 1. \u2047 We're also increasing our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow guidance, reflecting our strong year-to-date results and positive outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. \u2047 Finally, in late June, we announced a planned executive leadership transition that will occur next year. \u2047 Upon my retirement on February 1, 2022, Ole Rosgaard will assume responsibility for Greif's next chief executive officer. \u2047 Until that time, Ole will serve as chief operating officer and work closely with me and our executive leadership team on his transition. \u2047 Ole is a servant leader and a proven team builder with demonstrated commitment to customer service excellence and disciplined operational execution. \u2047 Those attributes, along with his extensive manufacturing and industrial packaging experience, makes him the ideal leader to take Greif forward. \u2047 Ole, I'd like to ask you to say a few words. \u2047 It's great to be with you. \u2047 As Pete mentioned, my name is Ole Rosgaard, and I'm excited and humbled to be named as Greif's next CEO. \u2047 I look forward to joining these calls in the quarters ahead and to working more closely with all of you in the future. \u2047 As head of global industrial packaging, my focus was on driving and delivering the operating and business results that our customers and shareholders expect. \u2047 As COO, that focus continues across the wider Greif portfolio. \u2047 And as Pete said, I'm working closely with the executive leadership team on our fiscal 2022 business plan and will share more about my priorities for the future after I assume my new role. \u2047 On slide four, global industrial packaging business delivered outstanding third-quarter results. \u2047 Our global steel drum volume increased by 8% per day. \u2047 Our global rigid IBCs and large plastic drum volumes both rose by more than 25% per day. \u2047 We also saw mid-teens improvement in our filling volumes versus the prior-year quarter, with demand accelerating specifically in APAC. \u2047 Third-quarter average selling prices were up across all key global substrates year over year due to raw material pass-through arrangements and strategic pricing actions. \u2047 In Latin America, steel drum volumes rose by 15% on a per day basis versus the prior year and benefited from improved industrial trends and a strong agricultural and citrus season. \u2047 In EMEA, third-quarter steel drum and rigid IBC volumes increased by roughly 5% and 28% per day, respectively, with strong improvement across most key end markets. \u2047 And finally, in APAC, steel drum volumes rose by 7% per day versus the prior year. \u2047 Demand was solid in China, but a little softer in Southeast Asia due to COVID-19-related lockdowns that we continue to monitor across parts of that region. \u2047 Across GIP, we see little indication of customers rebuilding inventory. \u2047 Supply chain conditions remain tight, and our team is managing this challenge very well. \u2047 While we have not experienced any significant raw material shortage, some of our customers have, which has negatively impacted our demand in certain regions. \u2047 Labor availability is becoming more challenging, which is not unique to Greif, and has impacted the productivity of some plants in both GIP and paper packaging. \u2047 These disruptions are not material at enterprise level, but certainly present operational challenges, nonetheless. \u2047 GIP's key end markets are healthy. \u2047 We experienced a double-digit performance volume demand year over year for both chemicals, specialty chemicals and lubricants in most parts of our global portfolio. \u2047 And volume demand for solid food and paste weakened versus the prior-year quarter, but this was largely a result of pricing and margin decisions on our part that impacted conical demand in Southern Europe. \u2047 GIP's stronger volumes and higher average selling prices resulted in higher segment sales and gross profit year over year. \u2047 GIP's third-quarter adjusted EBITDA was a record and rose by roughly $62 million due to higher sales, partially offset by higher SG&A expense, mainly attributed to higher incentive accruals. \u2047 The business also benefited from a $9 million operating tax recovery in Brazil and an $8 million FX tailwind. \u2047 Please recall that GIP's Q3 2020 results included an opportunistic sourcing benefit of $5 million that did not recur. \u2047 Looking ahead, GIP is off to a solid fourth quarter, with August signs comparable to our trend in July. \u2047 I'd also like to comment that our thoughts and prayers are also with those that were impacted by Hurricane Ida earlier this week. \u2047 While the damage from Ida is extensive and dramatic, at this time, what we know, we do not anticipate a material impact to our fiscal '21 fiscal results from the storm. \u2047 Paper packaging's third-quarter sales rose by roughly $120 million versus the prior year, attributed to stronger volumes and higher selling prices due to increases in published containerboard and boxboard prices. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA rose by roughly $18 million versus the prior year due to higher sales, partially offset by higher transportation and raw material headwinds, including a $24 million OCC drag. \u2047 SG&A expenses rose year over year, primarily due to higher incentive accruals. \u2047 We are actively executing on price increases in response to robust demand and cost inflation. \u2047 Since early June, we've announced five price increases, including a total of $100 a ton on CRB, $120 a ton in total on URB, and $70 a ton on containerboard. \u2047 As of August, the published indexes recognized $50 a ton on the CRB increases, $50 a ton on the URB increases, and a $50 and $60 a ton on linerboard and medium, respectively. \u2047 Demand in our converting operations remain very, very strong. \u2047 Third-quarter volumes in CorrChoice, our corrugated sheet feeder system, were up roughly 27% per day versus the prior year and are anticipated to stay strong through the fiscal fourth quarter. \u2047 Third-quarter specialty sales, which includes litho-laminate, triple-wall bulk packaging, and coatings, were up more than 38% versus the prior year. \u2047 Paper Packaging is off to a solid start in August. \u2047 Volumes in CorrChoice and our tube and core business are comparable to July's actuals. \u2047 Similar to my comments about GIP, we do not anticipate damage caused by Hurricane Ida to have a material impact to our paper packaging results in Q4. \u2047 Big picture, it was an outstanding quarter. \u2047 Third-quarter net sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, rose 34% versus the prior-year quarter due to stronger volumes and higher selling prices and were a record. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA rose by $78 million and was also a record. \u2047 As Pete mentioned, EBITDA results include a $9 million Brazilian tax refund from overpayment of revenue-based taxes to the government that occurred in prior periods and were wrongly levied. \u2047 That refund reduced SG&A. \u2047 Keep in mind, our adjusted EBITDA result overcame more than $50 million of combined OCC and incentive headwinds versus the prior year, making our performance that much more impressive. \u2047 Interest expense fell by roughly $6 million versus the prior-year quarter due to lower debt balances, lower interest rates and a lower interest rate tier on our credit facility as a result of our substantial debt repayment. \u2047 Our third-quarter GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate were both 22% and were flat to prior year. \u2047 Third-quarter adjusted class A earnings per share more than doubled to $1.93 per share. \u2047 Finally, third-quarter adjusted cash flow fell by roughly $43 million versus the prior year. \u2047 While profitability improved significantly, working capital was a substantial cash use compared to a source in the prior year due to the run-up in raw material prices and corresponding cost increases. \u2047 That said, our team is executing with discipline and controlling what it can with superb results as trailing fourth-quarter working capital as a percentage of sales improved by 190 basis points year over year to 10.7%. \u2047 As Pete mentioned, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow guidance, which reflects our strong year-to-date results and positive trajectory for the remainder of fiscal '21. \u2047 At the midpoint, we anticipate generating Class A earnings per share of $5.20, which is $0.50 per share more than our guide at Q2. \u2047 This improvement is largely due to stronger volumes and favorable pricing more than offsetting the additional OCC headwinds we expect to incur for the remainder of fiscal '21. \u2047 With our anticipated fiscal '21 result, we will more -- have more than doubled earnings per share since 2015 despite COVID-19's negative impact, the closure and/or divestiture of nearly 90 non-core or suboptimal plants and without any share repurchase benefit. \u2047 Also keep in mind that we currently have 600,000 more shares outstanding now versus the end of 2015. \u2047 We now anticipate generating between $335 million and $365 million in adjusted free cash flow, with a bias to the upside of that range. \u2047 At the midpoint, adjusted free cash flow has improved by $45 million relative to our Q2 guide due to improved earnings, slightly lower capital expenditures and cash tax savings, partially offset by higher working capital usage commensurate with our announced price increases to offset cost inflation. \u2047 To employ a consistent, three-pronged capital deployment strategy focused on business reinvestment, debt reduction and capital returns. \u2047 We have executed on an aggressive deleveraging plan and repaid $370 million in total debt since Q3 2020. \u2047 Our compliance leverage ratio improved by nearly a full turn over that time period, and we now anticipate reaching the high end of our targeted leverage ratio range by the fiscal year-end. \u2047 Given the dramatic improvement in our leverage profile and confidence in strong future cash generation, the Board approved a 4.5% increase to our quarterly dividend effective this year. \u2047 This is a first step toward a practice of steadily increasing our dividend as we discussed in prior earnings calls. \u2047 Looking ahead, we are well positioned to benefit from ongoing strength and improving trends in our key end markets. \u2047 Our extensive global portfolio, differentiated service capability and sharp focus on operational execution enable us to best serve our customer needs while generating significant shareholder value. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["greif q3 earnings per share
