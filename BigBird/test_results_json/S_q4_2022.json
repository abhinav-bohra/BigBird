{"article": ["In connection with our recently announced definitive agreement to acquire Attivo, management will provide additional information as to the benefits of the acquisition. \u2047 However, we'll not factor the planned acquisition into our fiscal '23 guidance at this time. \u2047 We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. \u2047 These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \u2047 These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. \u2047 This was another excellent quarter, and I'm extremely proud of the entire SentinelOne team. \u2047 Our ARR grew 123% year over year in the fourth quarter, making the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. \u2047 In today's digital world, cybersecurity is mission-critical infrastructure in every geography, industry vertical and organization size. \u2047 The demand environment remains incredibly strong. \u2047 We continue to scale our business as a result of our cutting-edge autonomous XDR platform and our powerful partner-supported go-to-market strategy. \u2047 We've built an AI-driven security platform that spans endpoint, cloud, IoT, data and now also identity. \u2047 I'm thrilled that today, we announced our plan to acquire Attivo Networks. \u2047 Attivo is a premier and highly differentiated solution that will enable us to provide cybersecurity in one of the most critical and dynamic parts of enterprise security today, the identity parameter. \u2047 With Attivo's user-centric identity capabilities, we will be able to support an even more comprehensive zero trust framework. \u2047 I'd also encourage everyone to read our shareholder letter we published on our Investor Relations website, which provides a lot more detail. \u2047 Let's take a look back at our fiscal '22. \u2047 It was a groundbreaking year for SentinelOne. \u2047 We started the year as a private company, delivered a triple-digit revenue and ARR growth rate through all four quarters and ended the year as one of the fastest-growing technology companies in public markets with outstanding growth in ARR rapidly approaching $300 million. \u2047 Throughout the year, we celebrated accomplishments that highlight our product market fit, innovation and superb customer experience, such as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection, highest scores in Gartner Critical Capabilities use cases and being the only vendor with 100% visibility and no misdetection in the latest MITRE evaluation. \u2047 Our fourth quarter and fiscal '22 results demonstrate the relentless execution of our teams and focus on innovation. \u2047 We're protecting more enterprises today than ever before at faster speed, greater scale, higher accuracy and with more automation. \u2047 Automation has never been more critical to tackle the complexity of today's threats. \u2047 I'd like to dig deeper into three key points about our performance. \u2047 First, our success with large enterprises underscores the scalability of our platform. \u2047 We added a record number of $100,000-plus ARR deals, a record number of million dollar-plus ARR customers and closed our largest ever net new customer contract, one of the most influential and leading global Internet companies. \u2047 Nick will discuss this in more detail later on. \u2047 Second, we paired our phenomenal growth with significant progress toward our long-term profitability targets. \u2047 I'm pleased to share that we ended the fourth quarter with double-digit year-over-year improvement in both our gross and operating margins. \u2047 Our gross margins expanded 12 percentage points year over year, and our operating margin improved 38%. \u2047 This progress reflects our growing scale and increasing efficiency. \u2047 Looking at the full year, fiscal '22 was an investment year for SentinelOne. \u2047 It featured our IPO, solidifying our brand as an industry leader, as well as investments in our go-to-market and innovation engines. \u2047 We doubled our total workforce. \u2047 I'm proud of SentinelOne being named to Comparably's Best Company Culture List and receiving the 2021 Great Places to Work award. \u2047 Given the significant market opportunity ahead, we remain committed to investing in the growth of our business. \u2047 And just like we did last year, we intend to balance this growth with further margin improvement in fiscal '23. \u2047 Finally, our business is performing extremely well with broad-based strength across new customer adds, existing customer renewals and upsells. \u2047 Throughout the year, we significantly expanded our platform offerings. \u2047 Our endpoint solution remains the primary driver of our business, which is being complemented by emerging growth vectors, including cloud, IoT and data. \u2047 We're still in the early innings of a large and expanding total market driven by the proliferation of hybrid work environment, digital transformation and an evolving threat landscape. \u2047 It's clear that we achieved a lot as a company in the past year, but we must remain as vigilant as ever around the threat landscape. \u2047 The persistence and sophistication of new attacks continues. \u2047 We entered 2021 on the heels of Sunburst and exited the year battling Log4j. \u2047 And most recently, the potential for cyber warfare has significantly increased in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. \u2047 This has further escalated the threat environment. \u2047 Our vision is to be a force for good, and we're committed to doing our part to help affected people and businesses in Ukraine and around the world to stay cyber secure. \u2047 We've established a Ukraine Crisis Resource Center and began offering free access to Singularity XDR for cyber threat protection in Ukraine. \u2047 We ran similar programs to help others in the wake of Sunburst, and we're committed to defending against cyber warfare. \u2047 Threat sharing and collaboration are essential to our collective mission against cyber attacks. \u2047 Our teams at SentinelLabs are leading the way by uncovering some of the most sophisticated attacks across the world. \u2047 Our global footprint puts us in a unique position to not only protect our customer base in real time but also produce novel research to educate and arm the cybersecurity community. \u2047 We're able to leverage the power of our partner ecosystem to stay on the front line with leading incident response providers like Mandiant, KPMG, Kroll, RSA and many others. \u2047 As an example, we recently named and published research on HermeticWiper related to the escalating cyber attacks surrounding the Russia-Ukraine conflict. \u2047 This was a real-time discovery on the eve of Russia's ground invasion. \u2047 It helped bring awareness to cyber attacks accompanying modern warfare. \u2047 Our publication was followed by an alert notice from Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, highlighting the significance and relevance of SentinelLabs' research. \u2047 If we look at the evolution of cybersecurity technologies for a moment, it's clear that legacy AV represents the past, EDR is the present and XDR is the future. \u2047 While the majority of enterprises still utilize legacy AV solutions, we have undoubtedly entered the XDR era. \u2047 At SentinelOne, we established the foundations of XDR by pioneering the world's first purpose-built AI-powered autonomous cybersecurity platform. \u2047 Singularity XDR brings the critical capabilities customers need from a comprehensive cybersecurity platform: speed, scale and automation. \u2047 Enterprises are increasingly selecting SentinelOne for our best-of-breed XDR. Over the past year, we significantly broadened our platform capabilities by introducing several mission-critical and highly differentiated innovations. \u2047 I will briefly highlight a few of these. \u2047 First, we enhanced our network visibility and control capabilities with Ranger Pro. \u2047 Ranger helps enterprises eliminate one of the most commonly exploited threat vectors: unprotected and rogue assets. \u2047 It reduces the attack surface by offering device mapping and management capabilities. \u2047 Second, we introduced Storyline Active Response, our engine for automated threat hunting, detection and response. \u2047 Next, we developed Remote Script Orchestration, a powerful endpoint management tool for both IR partners and enterprises. \u2047 Finally, we launched Singularity Mobile, a new AI-powered mobile security solution for iOS, Android and Chrome OS devices. \u2047 Building upon the acquisition of Scalyr, we launched DataSet in February of this year, a revolutionary live enterprise data platform for data queries, analytics, insights and data retention. \u2047 DataSet expands our capabilities beyond cybersecurity use cases. \u2047 It's a cloud-native, flexible enterprise data platform built for petabyte scale. \u2047 Not only DataSet is the back end for our Singularity XDR platform. \u2047 The technology is already being used by hundreds of enterprises, analyzing trillions of real-time events. \u2047 Customers like DoorDash, Copart, Asana, TomTom and many others are selecting DataSet to unlock the power of their own data with speed, scalability and technology-driven cost advantages. \u2047 Our platform approach is resonating and is contributing meaningfully to our financial performance. \u2047 Endpoint continues to fuel the company's growth. \u2047 At the same time, we're seeing outstanding traction with our adjacent platform technologies and capabilities. \u2047 Over a third of our fourth quarter new business was driven by our Singularity modules and DataSet, up from about 20% a year ago. \u2047 Across all of our capabilities, our cloud workload protection and data retention modules have been the most outstanding, each delivering year-over-year ACV growth of over 10x. \u2047 Let me spend a second on cloud security. \u2047 This is one of the fastest-growing markets in security today, and we're already doing extremely well on this front. \u2047 Demand for our cloud workload protection solution has been broad-based, both within our installed base, as well as with new customers. \u2047 Cloud security represents a sizable opportunity for SentinelOne for years to come. \u2047 And today, we are further expanding our addressable market and extending our XDR platform capabilities with our planned strategic acquisition of Attivo Networks. \u2047 We're adding another growth vector to our platform. \u2047 Identity now joins endpoint, cloud, IoT and data. \u2047 I couldn't be more excited to introduce everyone to Attivo. \u2047 Attivo aligns with the M&A strategy we previously outlined. \u2047 First, it expands our addressable market into a $4 billion and growing identity TAM. \u2047 And within that, Attivo is capturing share, growing its ARR north of 50%. \u2047 Second, user-centric identity protection is highly complementary and value-add for our XDR platform and customers. \u2047 It opens new customer and cross-sell opportunities. \u2047 Finally, it has a compelling financial profile and strong cultural fit, additive to our hypergrowth and accretive to gross margins. \u2047 Identity is a critical component of the enterprise parameter and zero trust framework. \u2047 Attivo's market-leading identity offerings help organizations keep passwords safe, admin privileges restricted and user identity intact. \u2047 Attivo Networks has the right technology and the team to advance our portfolio and is a natural extension of our Singularity XDR platform and go-to-market strategy. \u2047 Misused credentials are now one of the top techniques used in breaches. \u2047 If an attacker can compromise the endpoint, they will often look for the next layer of vulnerability, the user's credential. \u2047 If successful, attackers can install backdoors, exfiltrate data and change security policies. \u2047 Attivo, as part of SentinelOne, will help organizations reduce their attack surface not only at the device level but now at the human identity level, too. \u2047 Attivo has a clear product market fit with an established customer and revenue base. \u2047 Its differentiated and battle-tested solution is already trusted by over 300 customers from Fortune 500 enterprises to government entities. \u2047 Attivo is not just any identity company or technology. \u2047 We strongly believe that it's the best and most comprehensive identity security platform in the market today. \u2047 Let me briefly introduce you to the three parts of the Attivo platform. \u2047 First, identity protection is an agent-based solution that secures credentials and detects malicious identity behaviors. \u2047 It delivers real-time protection against credential theft, privilege escalation, lateral movement and more. \u2047 Second is identity infrastructure assessment, identity-based vulnerability scanning and management for enterprise infrastructure. \u2047 Attivo's scanner provides instant visibility of active directory misconfigurations, suspicious password changes and unauthorized access. \u2047 This complements our Ranger network asset visibility and control capabilities and now folds in a user-centric identity view. \u2047 Third, identity power deception. \u2047 Attivo's deception solution make attackers reveal themselves, their methods and targets through misdirection. \u2047 This sums up to a multi-layered approach and a broad set of capabilities to fend off, not just detect, identity-based attacks. \u2047 Attivo will put us front and center in the identity security market. \u2047 As Dave will discuss later financially, even in the early stages of a joint go-to-market, this acquisition will add to our hypergrowth trajectory. \u2047 I'd like to share a few closing thoughts. \u2047 There has never been a greater enterprise need for a modern cybersecurity platform, which means a tremendous business opportunity for SentinelOne's world-class autonomous protection. \u2047 We are still in the early innings of our innovation and growth. \u2047 Our outstanding fourth quarter and fiscal '22 financial performance speak for itself, triple-digit revenue and ARR growth paired with double-digit non-GAAP margin expansion. \u2047 We're perfectly positioned for continued success and expansion of our business even in times of global uncertainty. \u2047 We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter across every geography, driven by our go-to-market flywheel of sales, marketing, channel and technology partners. \u2047 More large enterprises are selecting SentinelOne than ever before because of our industry-leading efficacy, automation, ease of use and differentiated XDR capabilities. \u2047 Listening to customers and following many of the largest incidents in cybersecurity over the past few years, identity is a critical vector in delivering the most complete XDR platform. \u2047 Not only is it a natural fit within our platform. \u2047 It will complement our network of strategic service providers extremely well. \u2047 In Q4, we reported impressive ARR growth of 123%, reaching $292 million. \u2047 This growth was driven by a healthy mix of new customer additions, renewals and upsells. \u2047 Our momentum with large enterprises was particularly strong this quarter. \u2047 We added a record number of customers with ARR over $100,000 and a record number of million dollar-plus ARR customers. \u2047 All of this is extraordinary and reflects the success of our sales and marketing organizations. \u2047 Let me share more on this. \u2047 Our customers with ARR over $100,000 grew 137% year over year to 520. \u2047 And let me give you an example. \u2047 In Q4, we closed the largest new customer deal in our history with one of the most influential and leading global Internet companies. \u2047 This win came after an intensive evaluation process, including other next-gen security providers. \u2047 I'd like to highlight one additional win, which is emblematic of what we're seeing in the market. \u2047 Like most Fortune 500 companies, this enterprise was using multiple operating systems. \u2047 They lacked true security parity across all surfaces. \u2047 Their existing next-gen EDR vendor failed to quickly deploy and left critical Mac and Linux attack surfaces unprotected. \u2047 They terminated their existing three"], "gold_summary": ["q4 revenue rose 120 percent to $65.6 million.  \u2047  qtrly annualized recurring revenue (arr) increased 123% year-over-year to $292.3 million as of january
