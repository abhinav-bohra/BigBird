{"article": ["I'm Jason Bailey, Director of Investor Relations. \u2047 In addition, the conference call and accompanying slides will be archived following the call on that same website. \u2047 Bryan started with us on January 1, and we couldn't be happier to have him with us. \u2047 So turning to the business. \u2047 Over the course of a couple of weeks, the region, including our service territory, experienced an unprecedented prolonged cold spell that disrupted natural gas supplies, resulting in extreme natural gas prices. \u2047 The cold spell also resulted in a record winter peak demand for electricity. \u2047 While our service territory experienced record snowfall and record temperatures, our customers experienced minimal disruptions. \u2047 Through the efforts of our employees, our generation fleet performed admirably over the course of the week. \u2047 And so did our customers, heeding the call to conserve natural gas and electricity so that more serious shortages could be avoided. \u2047 Every day, we had generation online at each of our power plants. \u2047 Our fuel and purchase power costs for this event alone were more than all of our fuel and purchase power costs in 2020. \u2047 We anticipate the regulatory asset that will be created as a result of the storm to be in the range of approximately $800 million to $1 billion. \u2047 We have secured $1 billion of additional bank financing or liquidity to cover these costs. \u2047 We certainly understand the pressure that this event will have on our customers, and we will work with our commissions to help mitigate the impact to our customers' bills. \u2047 To that end, yesterday, we filed an application at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, requesting an intra-year fuel adjustment for a portion of the weather events cost. \u2047 To help mitigate the impact on OG&E customers, we are requesting alternative regulatory treatment to avoid our customers having to bear the entire cost of the 2021 weather event over the balance of the calendar year. \u2047 We proposed to continue to carry the remaining balance on our books and defer the cost to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a 10-year period and collect it through our fuel adjustment clause beginning in January 2022. \u2047 We requested that the regulatory that the asset included a carrying charge at a weighted average cost of capital, and we believe this approach will significantly lessen the monthly impact of the weather events cost to our customer. \u2047 We expect to quickly make a similar filing in Arkansas as well. \u2047 Bryan will discuss the financial effects of the February 2021 weather event in a moment. \u2047 We made an announcement last week with our support of the proposed merger between Enable and Energy Transfer, which is an important step in our repositioning as a pure-play utility. \u2047 From an investment return perspective, Enable has been very successful for our shareholders. \u2047 Since Enable's formed in 2013, we returned a modest investment into over $1 billion after-tax benefit to shareholders, which is equivalent to a 2.5 times after-tax return. \u2047 When the merger closes, we will own approximately 3% of the much more liquid limited partnership units of Energy Transfer. \u2047 Energy Transfer will acquire the general partner interest from us at some point for $10 million in aggregate cash consideration, and also CenterPoint will pay us $30 million. \u2047 We expect the transaction to close later this year. \u2047 The strength of our balance sheet allows us to be thoughtful on how and when we exit taking into consideration taxes, distributions and market considerations. \u2047 But let me be clear, we will exit our midstream investment, and we will do so in a responsible way that does not create overhang to the Energy Transfer units, allows us to achieve our goal of lower credit downgrade thresholds from the rating agencies. \u2047 Turning to our financial results. \u2047 We also reported earnings of $1.70 at the high end of our revised guidance, and ongoing earnings from OGE holdings of $0.37 per share. \u2047 Our 2021 utility guidance range is $1.76 to $1.86 per share. \u2047 The midpoint of this guidance is $1.81 per share and is based off 2.4% normalized load growth from 2020 and is equivalent to a 5% earnings per share growth rate. \u2047 So let me take a moment to discuss an item from the February weather event that does impact 2021. \u2047 Obviously, due to the extreme temperatures, kilowatt-hour sales were higher. \u2047 However, offsetting this is one of our customer programs, the Guaranteed Flat Bill program, which is a voluntary annual program and is largely subscribed by senior citizens and lower-income households and provides uncertainty around their monthly bill. \u2047 We will incur the incremental fuel expense under this program. \u2047 Bryan will go into more details when he discusses our 2020 results and 2021 guidance. \u2047 Turning to our economy. \u2047 We continued our impressive customer growth rate, and our customer base grew by 1.1%. \u2047 The Oklahoma and Arkansas economic recoveries remained strong. \u2047 In December, the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported at Fort Smith, Arkansas had an unemployment rate of 4.4%. \u2047 Oklahoma City had the seventh lowest unemployment rate for large metropolitan areas at 4.8% and while the state of Oklahoma's unemployment rate came in at 5.3%, showing the strength and resilience of the economies across our service territory. \u2047 Our economic development efforts are certainly paying off. \u2047 In 2020, we had 25 projects, 8,000 additional jobs in our service territory and $725 million of capital investment by businesses in our service territory. \u2047 Turning to our accomplishments in 2020. \u2047 COVID was certainly not anything the world was expecting, but we adjusted our way of life and quickly set up processes to support our customers and communities and protect our employees. \u2047 The weather played a crucial role last year in how we energize life for customers. \u2047 From an unusually mild summer weather to the most destructive ice storm in the company history in late October to New Year's Eve snowstorm to close out the year, the effects of weather this year were unmistakable. \u2047 We did not miss a beat. \u2047 However, as our teams continue to excel through the challenges, recording a number of significant accomplishments. \u2047 The company recorded its second safest year in history in 2020, making each of the last five years our safest ever. \u2047 We kicked off our grid enhancement projects in Oklahoma, including securing a mechanism for recovery of our investments, which will provide a more resilient and reliable system for our customers. \u2047 With these grid enhancements, we expect to provide our Oklahoma customers the same positive results that we've seen in Arkansas, including fewer outages and much faster restoration times. \u2047 In Arkansas, we filed our third formula rate plan last year. \u2047 We successfully negotiated a constructive settlement in that case that allowed for the maximum increase permitted and are awaiting a final order by the commission, and these new rates are expected in April. \u2047 Looking ahead to '21, we have several exciting items in the works, including the continuation of our Oklahoma and Arkansas grid enhancement projects. \u2047 We'll file an integrated resource plan in both Oklahoma and Arkansas later this year. \u2047 We will file our fourth formula rate plan in Arkansas, and we'll plan our filing for our next Oklahoma general rate review, which has to be filed no later than the first quarter of '22. \u2047 We are constructing our first solar farm in Arkansas and expect it to be operational later this summer. \u2047 We have a lot, and I want to make sure you understand that we have a lot really exciting projects that we've been working on for some time, working in and around our communities, and we'll certainly announce these are they're finalized over the next couple of months. \u2047 So I'm proud of what we've accomplished in the last five years and what lies ahead for our company. \u2047 We've invested $3.3 billion in our system. \u2047 Our O&M cost per customer is lower now than it was at the end of 2015. \u2047 If you look at our '21 guidance for O&M, it's approximately $29 million below our original guidance in 2020. \u2047 That's real long-term structural savings that will benefit our customers. \u2047 We returned $1.4 billion of cash for shareholders in the form of dividends and delivered a 5% compound annual growth rate at Utility. \u2047 And on top of that, we have some of if not the lowest rates in the nation, and they're lower now than they were in 2011. \u2047 We've cut our CO2 emissions by greater than 40%. \u2047 And those are real, consistent results, delivering to our shareholders what we said we would deliver year-over-year. \u2047 We're more active in advancing our ESG objectives and initiatives. \u2047 We're deeply embedded in our communities and are a key driver of growth and economic development for the communities we serve. \u2047 We've always been committed to be responsible stewards. \u2047 We'll be sharing these stories more regularly going forward. \u2047 We have a solid and compelling investment thesis backed by a track record of performance. \u2047 When you look over the last five or 10 years, we've delivered compounding annual growth rates between 5% and 6%, and we expect to keep true to our commitment to deliver on our earnings growth target of 5% by investing in lower-risk investments that improve our customers' experience. \u2047 We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, which protects our dividend, and we operate in jurisdictions that are experiencing real load and customer growth and have delivered increasingly supportive regulatory outcomes. \u2047 You, our shareholders, should be confident in your decision to own and invest in OG&E. \u2047 Before I close, OG&E is celebrating its 119th anniversary this month. \u2047 By honoring our frontline healthcare heroes, our healthcare workers have earned the title Hero, especially throughout the last year, and we're proud to make a $100,000 donation this month to support their critical efforts. \u2047 I can think of no better way to mark this occasion. \u2047 We are proud of our accomplishments in 2020 and poised to continue to deliver those results in 2021. \u2047 While COVID has impacted all of us. \u2047 I want all of you to be confident that we're not focused on winning the downturn, but winning the recovery. \u2047 Starting on slide 10 and before we discuss 2020 results and this year's outlook, I'd like to update you on the financial effects from the extraordinary February 2021 weather events, which will likely have a negative impact to our current year earnings. \u2047 As Sean mentioned, in order to keep life-sustaining power on for our customers during the 11 days when temperatures were between 23 and 45 degrees below average, the company incurred in the range of $800 million to $1 billion in fuel and purchase power costs. \u2047 We will be able to firm up these estimates once we receive settlement statements from the Southwest Power Pool in the coming weeks. \u2047 From a funding standpoint, while we already have a $900 million credit facility in place, we felt it important to obtain an incremental funding source. \u2047 And this week, we closed on a $1 billion credit commitment agreement that will allow for ample liquidity. \u2047 With respect to cost recovery, the company has fueled tracker mechanisms in both Oklahoma and Arkansas. \u2047 In Oklahoma, we are allowed to file for intra-year adjustments to the cost once fuel and purchase power costs exceed $50 million and under or over collections in a year. \u2047 Thus, this week, as Sean mentioned, we filed an application in Oklahoma, requesting an intra-year fuel adjustment for a portion of the weather events fuel cost. \u2047 We expect this revised tariff to become effective in rates this spring, providing support to our credit metrics. \u2047 For the remaining cost, our filing in Oklahoma seeks commission approval to place the deferred cost in a regulatory asset accruing at our weighted average cost of capital. \u2047 We will work with the commission to obtain an order as quickly as possible. \u2047 Switching gears to 2020 results. \u2047 On slide 11, you can see that for the full year 2020, we achieved ongoing net income of $416 million or $2.08 per share as compared to net income of $434 million or $2.16 per share in 2019. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, OGE Energy Corp. reported a loss of $174 million or $0.87 per share, reflecting the impairment charge recorded on our Enable midstream investment in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 OG&E's ongoing 2020 results were $0.04 lower than 2019 as unfavorable late summer weather lowered earnings compared to the prior year by $0.11. \u2047 To mitigate the headwinds of mild weather and the economy, our employees were relentless in pursuing cost reductions and work deferrals, resulting in significant O&M savings compared to 2019 and our original plan. \u2047 Results were also favorably affected by a full year of new rates from the Oklahoma rate review that was implemented in July of 2019. \u2047 We also continued to see steady earnings growth from our Arkansas formula rate plan, which contributed $0.02 of earnings in 2020. \u2047 On our third quarter call, we revised our 2020 OG&E utility guidance through a narrowed range of $1.68 to $1.70 per share. \u2047 And due to strong O&M management in the fourth quarter, we were able to hit the top end of that range. \u2047 Our strong finish to 2020 sets us up nicely for 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Turning to load on slide 12. \u2047 In on our third quarter call, we indicated an expectation of full year load declines of 1.6%, and we finished the year at about that level. \u2047 Over the last four months of 2020, we continue to see month-over-month improvements in all customer classes. \u2047 The residential class, our most profitable, remained resilient at levels we've seen throughout the pandemic. \u2047 Importantly, customer growth was 1.1% in 2020, providing a solid foundation for load growth in 2021. \u2047 On slide 13, we look ahead to 2021 load expectations and forecast customer load to be 2.4% above 2020 levels and about 0.5% above 2019 levels. \u2047 Residential load is expected to exceed 2020 levels early in the year, but is then forecasted to be below 2021 -- below 2020 levels for the full year as more residential customers return to the workplace. \u2047 For our commercial, industrial and public authority customers, we expect load growth in the second half of 2021 to be strong as vaccinations become commonplace and the economy continues its recovery. \u2047 Overall, we believe load will have a positive contribution to 2021 earnings in comparison to 2020, as illustrated on the next slide. \u2047 As we headed into February, we had great confidence in our ability to deliver $1.81 of earnings per share at OG&E, which is in line with our previous guidance of a 5% growth annually off of our 2019 baseline of $1.65. \u2047 We continue to have confidence in our ability to grow at 5% long term and expect 2022 earnings per share to be in line with the 5% growth from the midpoint of our 2021 guidance of $1.81. \u2047 Our initial $1.81 earnings per share guidance for 2021 assumes normal"], "gold_summary": ["2021 og&e earnings guidance is $1.76 to $1.86 per average diluted share."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3 earnings per share $0.37.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $0.37.  \u2047  q3 earnings
