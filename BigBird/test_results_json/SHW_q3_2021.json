{"article": ["Sherwin-Williams remained focused in the third quarter on solving customer challenges, combating rising costs with pricing and investing for future growth in a difficult and highly fluid environment that is impacting the entire coatings industry. \u2047 Demand remained generally robust, but raw material inflation remained persistently high and raw material availability failed to improve. \u2047 While these conditions challenged our quarterly results, we continued to strengthen our customer relationships and take actions that strongly position us for the long term. \u2047 We're confident in the demand outlook and even more confident in our strategy, our people and our position in the market. \u2047 Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers. \u2047 Starting with the top line. \u2047 Third quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 0.5% to $5.15 billion. \u2047 Raw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single-digit percentage, with about 75% of the impact in The Americas Group. \u2047 The remaining impact was largely in the Consumer Brands Group with an immaterial impact to Performance Coatings Group. \u2047 Consolidated gross margin decreased 630 basis points to 41.6%, driven by lower sales volume, raw material cost inflation outpacing our price increases near term and supply chain inefficiencies. \u2047 SG&A expense decreased 2.7% in dollars and decreased 90 basis points to 26.6% as a percent of sales. \u2047 Consolidated profit before tax decreased $264.1 million or 30.2% to $611.5 million. \u2047 The third quarters of 2021 and 2020 included $70.3 million and $76.4 million of acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, respectively. \u2047 Excluding these items, consolidated profit before tax decreased 28.4% to $681.8 million. \u2047 Diluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to $1.88 per share from $2.55 per share a year ago. \u2047 The third quarters of 2021 and 2020 both included acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense of $0.21 per share. \u2047 Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 24.3% to $2.09 per share from $2.76 per share. \u2047 EBITDA was $834.2 million in the quarter or 16.2% of sales. \u2047 Net operating cash grew to $2.1 billion, or 13.5% of sales in the first nine months of 2021. \u2047 Moving on to our operating segments. \u2047 Despite strong demand, sales in The Americas Group decreased 0.4% as volume and mid-single-digit selling price increases could not fully offset the decrease related to raw material availability. \u2047 Segment margin decreased 3.8 percentage points to 21.3%, resulting primarily from lower sales volume and higher raw material costs, partially offset by selling price increases. \u2047 Segment SG&A remained basically flat year-over-year in dollars and as a percent of sales, as we continued investing in strategic growth initiatives. \u2047 Sales in the Consumer Brands Group decreased 22.8% against a very strong comparison a year ago. \u2047 The decrease included approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, lower volume and the negative impact from raw material availability, partially offset by selling price increases. \u2047 Adjusted segment margin decreased 11.7 percentage points to 14.7% of sales, resulting primarily from lower sales volume, higher raw material and supply chain inefficiencies, partially offset by selling price increases and good sales and marketing cost control. \u2047 Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 17.4%, driven by volume, price increases and favorable currency exchange. \u2047 Adjusted segment margin decreased 5.5 percentage points to 10.5% of sales as operating leverage from the higher volume, selling price increases and good cost control were more than offset by higher raw material costs, where inflation was the highest among the company's three operating segments. \u2047 Let me begin by reiterating the themes we provided on our September 29 update call. \u2047 First, the demand environment remains robust across our pro architectural and industrial end markets. \u2047 Many external indicators and more importantly, our customers, remain highly positive. \u2047 Demand is not the issue. \u2047 Second, we are ready to meet this demand. \u2047 We continue to invest in growth initiatives. \u2047 We have significant production capacity available today and we are bringing 50 million gallons of incremental architectural production capacity online over the next two quarters. \u2047 Our capabilities are not the issue. \u2047 The issues that impacted our third quarter and have persisted in October continued to be industrywide raw material availability constraints and inflation. \u2047 Let me be very clear on how we are responding. \u2047 Nobody has more assets and capabilities than Sherwin-Williams. \u2047 We're employing all of these to keep customers in paint and on the job better than our competitors. \u2047 We will continue to focus on customer solutions. \u2047 We are aggressively combating raw material inflation with significant pricing actions across each of our businesses. \u2047 We implemented multiple price increases in the quarter. \u2047 We will continue to do so as necessary. \u2047 We continue to work closely with our suppliers on solutions to improve availability sooner rather than later. \u2047 At the same time, we're exploring every avenue to better control our own destiny going forward, including our recent announcement to acquire Specialty Polymers, Inc. There's no shortage of confidence on our team, which is deep and experienced. \u2047 We fully expect we will emerge from these current challenges a stronger company with stronger customer relationships and with continued strong value creation for our shareholders. \u2047 In just a moment, I'll add some color to Jim's third quarter results summary. \u2047 But first, I'd like to make a comment on our results year-to-date. \u2047 While events largely outside of our control, it forced us to adjust our expectations, we have still delivered a solid performance. \u2047 2021 year-to-date consolidated sales were up 9.4% or $1.31 billion. \u2047 Despite high teens raw material inflation, adjusted PBT increased 1.5% or $33.1 million and adjusted diluted net income per share increased 4.8% to $6.80 per share. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA is $2.73 billion or 18% of consolidated sales. \u2047 Even in this unusual environment, we've continued to make investments that will drive our momentum over the long term. \u2047 And we are confident we will see significant margin expansion as availability and inflation headwinds eventually subside. \u2047 Now returning to segment performance in the third quarter. \u2047 In The Americas Group, raw material availability challenges were a significant drag on sales. \u2047 The good news is that underlying demand remains sound and reported backlogs are strong. \u2047 We expect growth rates will improve significantly, commensurate with improvement in the industry supply chain. \u2047 Sales growth in the third quarter was led by Protective & Marine, which was up by high single-digit percentage. \u2047 We're seeing good demand in this business from customers in oil and gas, flooring and seal fabrication markets. \u2047 TAG's largest business, residential repaint, grew by a low single-digit percentage against a strong double-digit comparison. \u2047 As industry supply chain issues are resolved, we would expect this business to return to its prior growth levels, where we've delivered double-digit growth for the last five years. \u2047 New residential sales increased by a low single-digit percentage. \u2047 New housing permits and starts have been trending very well since last summer, and our customers are reporting solid order rates. \u2047 We're seeing a number of projects being pushed out as a variety of building materials beyond paint are in short supply. \u2047 Property management was up slightly in the quarter. \u2047 Improving apartment turns, along with the return to travel, the workplace and school are tailwinds that should support higher growth when raw material availability improves. \u2047 Our commercial business was down slightly in the quarter. \u2047 Similar to new residential, projects are taking longer to reach the painting phase due to short supply of multiple building materials. \u2047 And finally, as expected, our DIY business was down double digits versus an extremely difficult comparison, which was exacerbated by the raw material availability issues. \u2047 From a product perspective, interior paint sales performed better than exterior sales, with interior being the larger part of the mix. \u2047 We realized a mid-single-digit increase in price in the third quarter resulting from our February one and August one price increases and our mid-September surcharge. \u2047 We would expect the combination of these pricing actions to result in a high single-digit percentage price realization in the fourth quarter, putting our full year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range. \u2047 We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed. \u2047 We've opened 50 net new stores year-to-date. \u2047 Along with these new stores, we continue to make investments in sales reps, management trainees, innovative new products, e-commerce and productivity-enhancing services. \u2047 We are not taking our foot off the gas on these growth initiatives. \u2047 Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. \u2047 Sales decreased by a double-digit percentage, driven by difficult comparisons to the prior year, consumers returning to the workplace, raw material availability issues and the divestiture of the Wattyl business. \u2047 Overall, DIY demand continued to moderate to more normal levels compared to 2020. \u2047 This was partially offset by growth in the North American Pros Who Paint category, which was up strong double digits in the quarter and year-to-date. \u2047 While sales are down in all regions, sales were less impacted in North America, our largest region, compared to Europe and Asia, where COVID restrictions were more impactful. \u2047 Pricing was positive in the quarter, though below the level of The Americas Group. \u2047 As you know, our global supply chain organization is managed within this segment. \u2047 This team continues to work with suppliers to navigate the industrywide raw material supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida. \u2047 We stand ready with ample capacity and are adding more to serve customers at a higher level as raw material availability improves. \u2047 Last, let me comment on the third quarter trends in Performance Coatings Group. \u2047 We continue to see momentum as this is the fifth straight quarter of growth for this business. \u2047 Group sales increased by more than 17% in the quarter, including a currency translation tailwind of 2%. \u2047 Price was in the high single-digit range, and all regions and all divisions generated growth. \u2047 Regionally, sales in the quarter grew fastest in Europe and Latin America, followed by North America and Asia. \u2047 Every division in the group grew, the majority by double digits, driven by robust underlying demand, new customer wins and share of wallet gains. \u2047 I'll start with packaging, which generated strong double-digit growth against a high single-digit comparison last year. \u2047 Sales were up double digits in every region. \u2047 Demand for food and beverage cans remains robust, and our non-BPA coatings continue to gain traction within existing and new customers. \u2047 Next is General Industrial, the largest division of the group, which posted its third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. \u2047 Sales were up double digits in every region. \u2047 Sales were strong across most of our customer segments, led by heavy equipment, containers and general finishing. \u2047 Our Coil Coatings business remains a consistent performer. \u2047 Sales grew by a double-digit percentage for the second consecutive quarter and were positive in all regions. \u2047 This team continues to do an excellent job at winning new accounts in all regions. \u2047 Construction and appliances led to growth. \u2047 Automotive refinish sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage. \u2047 Miles driven are nearing pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 New installations of our products and systems in North America remained strong. \u2047 The Industrial Wood division generated low single-digit growth. \u2047 Growth in North America, our largest region, was up strong double digits, but was offset by Asia Pacific where COVID-related shutdowns had a significant negative impact on sales. \u2047 New residential construction continues to drive robust demand for our products in kitchen cabinetry, flooring and furniture applications. \u2047 Before moving to our outlook, let me speak to capital allocation year-to-date. \u2047 We've returned a little over $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. \u2047 We've invested $2.1 billion to purchase 8.075 million shares at an average price of $265.88. \u2047 We distributed $442.9 million in dividends, an increase of 20.4%. \u2047 We also invested $248 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $36 million for our Building our Future project. \u2047 We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times. \u2047 We also announced the Sika and Specialty Polymer acquisitions, which are expected to close in early 2022, if not sooner. \u2047 Turning to our outlook. \u2047 We expect robust demand to continue in North American pro architectural end markets. \u2047 We expect DIY demand to continue normalizing as consumers return to the workplace. \u2047 We expect industrial demand to remain strong. \u2047 Raw material availability challenges will remain a headwind in the fourth quarter, but the situation is improving. \u2047 We believe we have weathered the worst of Hurricane Ida, and supply should continue to come back online. \u2047 We expect to be in a make-and-ship mode and do not anticipate building any inventory until the first quarter of 2022. \u2047 On the cost side of the equation, our raw material inflation expectations for the year moved up to the low 20% range from the high teens given additional pressure we've seen since our last guidance. \u2047 We do not see any meaningful improvement until well into 2022. \u2047 All businesses remain aggressive in implementing price increases as necessary to offset these costs. \u2047 We recognize that the timing of price realization will continue to put pressure on margins in the near term. \u2047 And as we've said many times, we expect margin expansion over the long term and maintain our gross margin target in the 45% to 48% range. \u2047 Against this backdrop, we anticipate fourth quarter 2021 consolidated net sales will be up by a mid- to high single-digit percentage compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 We expect The Americas Group sales to be up by a mid- to high single-digit percentage, with pro sales at or above the high end of this range and DIY sales returning to a more historic level. \u2047 We expect Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid-teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, and we expect Performance Coatings sales to be up by a mid-teens percentage. \u2047 Embedded in our guidance is a similar impact to our architectural businesses as a percent to sales from raw material availability as we experienced in the third quarter. \u2047 For the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single-digit percentage. \u2047 We expect The Americas Group to be up by a high single"], "gold_summary": ["sherwin-williams q3 adjusted earnings per share $2.09.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per
