{"article": ["These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. \u2047 These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. \u2047 We closed on the acquisition of Apple Leisure Group on November 1, and we are collectively even more thrilled about the prospects for the combined company today than we were when we first announced our plans back in August. \u2047 As I reflect over the past several months during which I've gotten to know the ALG team much better, met with hotel owners and toured a number of stunning AMR collection resorts. \u2047 I'm energized and really excited about the bright future for ALG as a part of Hyatt. \u2047 The cultural fit between our two companies with a joint focus of care could not be better. \u2047 And the timing is proving to be very auspicious as leisure demand continues to be durable and a growing proportion of our segment mix. \u2047 We look forward to keeping you well informed on the progress of our integration efforts and performance of the ALG platform moving forward. \u2047 Turning to our results. \u2047 We are another quarter into the recovery and have again produced results that demonstrate the strength of our business and reinforce that we are emerging from this challenging period as a more agile and stronger company. \u2047 In the span of just two quarters, our quarterly adjusted EBITDA has improved $130 million, recovering to nearly 70% of 2019 levels in the third quarter. \u2047 We've worked tirelessly to evolve and reimagine aspects of our operating model and the financial results and our momentum demonstrate our progress. \u2047 Importantly, while we have been focused on preserving cash and managing expenses tightly, we've invested in areas that are driving growth, and we have not wavered from our long-term strategy. \u2047 With vaccination rates continuing to rise, travel restrictions around the world easing and borders reopening, I am as confident as I've ever been that we are on a path to full recovery. \u2047 I'm optimistic that the most recent trends in our business and also the important developments over the past quarter, including, of course, the acquisition of ALG demonstrates significant progress toward realizing the benefits of our long-term strategy. \u2047 Before diving deeper into the progress on our strategy, let's take a look at the latest business trends. \u2047 RevPAR in the third quarter continued to recover at a robust pace, accelerating nearly 30% compared to the second quarter and doubling RevPAR levels in the first quarter. \u2047 As discussed on our last earnings call, we experienced a wave of leisure demand during the summer with systemwide RevPAR eclipsing $100 in July, which was approximately 75% recovered as compared to 2019. \u2047 As we moved into August, RevPAR decelerated by approximately 10% as compared to July driven by seasonality, coupled with reimposed travel restrictions in certain markets related to the Delta variant. \u2047 However, this deceleration was short-lived. \u2047 Demand rebounded throughout September and has strengthened further as we move into the fourth quarter. \u2047 Absolute RevPAR in October is nearly as strong as July at $98. \u2047 What is encouraging is that the recovery has broadened, whereas our strength in July was primarily driven by resort locations, the improvement more recently has been from urban locations, which experienced RevPAR growth of 10% in October as compared to July. \u2047 From a segmentation perspective, Leisure Transient remains the top-performing segment. \u2047 Systemwide Leisure Transient revenue was at 96% of fully recovered levels in the third quarter, an incredible performance when considering the significant restrictions that were still prevalent in many parts of the world. \u2047 Strong leisure transient demand is proving to be far more than the summer surge as Leisure Transient revenue booked in October for all periods was over 20% ahead of 2019 levels. \u2047 Further, total transient revenue at our Americas resorts is pacing 25% ahead of 2019 levels for the last weeks of December. \u2047 At this pace, we anticipate the festive season could be one of the strongest we've ever experienced. \u2047 We've also been pleased with the progression of group and business transient demand. \u2047 While demand did not accelerate immediately following Labor Day due to the Delta variant, the upward momentum has been steady throughout September and October. \u2047 The rate of improvement in group during October has been particularly meaningful after seeing elevated levels of cancellations in August and early September due to the Delta variant. \u2047 Since that time, cancellations have receded while short-term group demand has strengthened. \u2047 Overall, systemwide group revenue jumped 16% in October as compared to September and is trending at 50% of fully recovered levels. \u2047 Group bookings for 2022 are also showing significant improvement. \u2047 In October, our leads for 2022 grew by 38% as compared to September, and we're now 10% ahead of 2019 levels for group business that is likely to book. \u2047 While group pace for 2022 is approximately 80% recovered, a bit weaker than what we reported last quarter. \u2047 The strong current level of group bookings, coupled with growing lead volume provides confidence that momentum will build as we head into 2022. \u2047 As for business transient, the recovery has been softer than group, but is still showing steady momentum with demand recovering to 46% of 2019 levels in October. \u2047 We continue to see stronger growth in our regional accounts as compared to our larger national accounts. \u2047 However, that gap is narrowing. \u2047 Our largest corporate accounts have grown by 50% since June and we continue to be encouraged by dialogue with our corporate customers who are returning to offices in bigger numbers with many planning on a more robust return to travel in 2022. \u2047 The recovery momentum has also expanded geographically. \u2047 One of the areas with the most pronounced improvements is Europe, which is now trending at roughly the same level as the United States after seeing RevPAR quadruple over the past five months. \u2047 We're also seeing occupancy of 70% in the Middle East, which is similar to 2019 levels, driven by very strong demand from the Dubai Expo, which kicked off in October and runs through March of 2022. \u2047 Lastly, occupancy in India, which was below 20% just a few months ago due to the Delta variant, is now trending at almost 60% as we exit October. \u2047 When you add up the trends, both from a geographic and purpose of visit perspective, coupled with the most recent data on forward bookings, the underlying momentum in the business is clear, and it's consistent with our conviction that we are on a path to full recovery. \u2047 Turning to our long-term strategy. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, we've been actively positioning Hyatt for the future with intense focus on advancing three pillars of our long-term strategy, namely: first, to maximize our core business; second, to integrate new growth platforms; and third, to optimize our capital deployment. \u2047 I cannot recall a quarter where we advanced our long-term strategy as much as we did in the third quarter of this year. \u2047 Let me start with the first pillar of our strategy, maximizing our core business as it underpins everything that we do. \u2047 We've been particularly focused on three key areas within this pillar to drive performance. \u2047 First, focusing on the high-end traveler going deeper into the segment, not extending outside the segment. \u2047 Second, driving more business to our direct channels through engagement supported by data and analytics. \u2047 And third, operating with excellence through agility and responsiveness to market dynamics. \u2047 Our progress in these areas is not only reflected in the third quarter financial results I commented on earlier, but is also demonstrated in the results of our core metrics as compared to the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Several highlights include market share growth, stronger direct channel mix, a higher percentage of arrivals to our hotels from existing loyalty members and better comparable O&L margins as compared to the same period in 2019. \u2047 The ultimate test is investment by owners and our brands, which is best demonstrated through our net rooms growth and pipeline. \u2047 Our net rooms growth was 6.9% in the third quarter, again, leading the industry with notable openings, including the Thompson Hollywood, the Park Hyatt Toronto and the Hyatt Ziva Riviera Cancun. \u2047 And our pipeline at 103,000 rooms again expanded from the prior quarter, represents an industry-leading 41% of our existing property portfolio. \u2047 We were also able to achieve significant progress; with the second pillar of our long-term strategy, integrating new growth platforms through our acquisition of Apple Leisure Group, an exciting new asset-light growth platform for Hyatt. \u2047 ALG now as part of Hyatt, immediately doubles the number of resorts in our portfolio, increases our European footprint by more than 60% and positions us as the world's largest operator of hotels in the fast-growing luxury all-inclusive resort segment. \u2047 Further, we expect it to increase our systemwide stabilized leisure transient revenue mix to over[50%]. \u2047 We also expect the ALG brands to drive accretive rooms well into the future similar to what we've achieved with our Two Roads Hospitality acquisition in 2018, which has been a significant driver of growth for Hyatt this year, including conversions and expansion of our pipeline. \u2047 In 2021, ALG through the AMR collection is expected to finish the year with net rooms growth of 35% with the addition of 31 hotels and approximately 8,500 rooms and taking the AMR collection to 101 hotels in total with 33,000 rooms by the end of 2021. \u2047 The ALG acquisition represents a brand-defining moment in Hyatt's more than 60-year history, much like the company's international expansion into Hong Kong or the launch of the Park Hyde brand. \u2047 We are now marking the beginning of a new chapter for Hyatt. \u2047 In addition to the exciting growth the acquisition represents for Hyatt, and the new experiences the ALG platform provides our guests. \u2047 The earnings base from ALG also allows us to make significant progress on the third pillar of our long-term strategy, which is to optimize our capital deployment. \u2047 We are very encouraged that ALG is on track to outperform its 2019 results in 2021, exceeding the expectations of our underwriting. \u2047 This earnings base allows us to execute an essential part of our capital strategy to unlock the value of our real estate assets by selling assets over time and prioritizing the reinvestment of proceeds into growth opportunities for Hyatt. \u2047 In August, at the same time, as the acquisition announcement, we committed to a $2 billion expansion of our asset disposition commitment. \u2047 The proceeds from these future asset sales will allow us to deleverage our balance sheet on an accelerated basis as we reduce the debt incurred to fund the ALG acquisition. \u2047 We've initiated this effort with two properties currently in the market and other active discussions underway. \u2047 We feel very confident in our ability to execute on this expanded asset disposition commitment. \u2047 We've realized over $3 billion in proceeds since our original announcement in 2017 at a very attractive multiple, and we have a high quality and a highly desirable asset base that remains on our balance sheet today. \u2047 As a reminder, the $3 billion commitment was in two parts, $1.5 billion in 2017 and an additional $1.5 billion in 2019. \u2047 During September, we completed the sale of two assets, the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe and Alila Ventana Big Sur, for approximately $500 million in gross proceeds and reached cumulatively over $3 billion in total gross proceeds from asset sales since 2017 at an average aggregate multiple of 17.4 times. \u2047 We retained long-term management agreements for both of the hotels that we recently disposed of and exceeded our disposition target well ahead of schedule. \u2047 In summary, we look forward to continuing our track record of realizing proceeds in excess of the valuation implied by the multiple for Hyatt and simultaneously transforming our earnings mix to an expected 80% fee-based proportion by the end of 2024. \u2047 Importantly, with the earnings from our ALG acquisition, coupled with fees driven by our industry-leading growth, we'll be able to achieve this progress while maintaining investment capacity for future opportunities. \u2047 Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we are making toward our long-term strategy as we remain intently focused on executing the three key areas I've outlined as we position ourselves for the future. \u2047 Finally, I want to touch upon the owner's meeting we recently held a couple of weeks ago at the beautiful Hyatt Regency Huntington Beach Resort. \u2047 The attendance was as strong as it's ever been, and the energy from gathering in person was truly palpable. \u2047 I was struck by the collective optimism we share about the future and how our purpose of caring for people so they can be their best has resonated with and been felt by our owners during the most of year downturn this industry has ever experienced. \u2047 Their feedback centered on our attention to listening intently, focusing on the important issues and staying connected to their needs. \u2047 We have much to do to ensure we are attracting the best talent in a challenging labor environment, to ensure we're doing everything possible to drive market share and operating margins for our brands and owners, and to make sure our systems and services keep pace with quickly shifting trends in technology. \u2047 I left the meeting feeling energized at the progress we are making and the opportunities ahead to continue to deliver value to all of our constituents. \u2047 We made significant progress toward realizing the benefits of our long-term strategy. \u2047 And as the recovery continues to unfold, we have positioned Hyatt to emerge from this pandemic a stronger and more agile company. \u2047 Our view to sustainable demand in the future continues to sharpen and with each passing month, our conviction and our enthusiasm grows. \u2047 Joan, over to you. \u2047 Late yesterday, we reported a third quarter net income attributable to Hyatt of $120 million and a diluted earnings per share of $1.15 with our results favorably impacted by gains on the sale of real estate of $307 million. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $110 million in the third quarter effectively doubling our adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter, again demonstrating our ability to translate improving demand into a strong increase in earnings. \u2047 In a RevPAR environment that is improving but still challenging, we were able to narrow our adjusted EBITDA decline to only 32% in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019, which is the same as our systemwide RevPAR decline of 32%. \u2047 Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.4% for the third quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.9% we reported in the third quarter of 2019, serving as yet another marker of operating excellence in a lower demand environment. \u2047 Systemwide RevPAR was $94 in the third quarter, representing a 29% increase compared to second quarter. \u2047 Both occupancy and rate contributed to the sequential growth with occupancy improving by 700 basis points and rate growing by 12%. \u2047 The improvement in rate"],
