{"article": ["Before we begin, I'd like to review the safe harbor statements. \u2047 During the call today, we may also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Additionally, the content of this conference call may contain time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of this earnings call. \u2047 We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise this information. \u2047 I will now turn the conference over to our CEO and chief investment officer, Mohit Marria. \u2047 Joining me on the call today are Choudhary Yarlagadda, our president and chief operating officer; Rob Colligan, our chief financial officer; and Vic Falvo, our head of capital markets. \u2047 Before we begin, in November, we announced the retirement of Matt Lambiase. \u2047 Matt founded and led Chimera since 2007. \u2047 Under his leadership, Chimera grew to a $3.8 billion mortgage REIT and paid more than $5.2 billion in dividends to shareholders. \u2047 Matt was a great leader, friend and mentor for everyone in our company. \u2047 This quarter, Chimera continued its path of book value reappreciation. \u2047 Throughout the year, we worked diligently on the liability side of our balance sheet to enhance liquidity and strengthen our cash position. \u2047 These actions enabled us to retain our high-yielding credit portfolio and benefit from the improvements in asset prices that started in the second half of 2020. \u2047 Chimera's book value improved nearly 4% in the fourth quarter and over 16% at the middle of the year. \u2047 This improved book value, combined with the company's dividend policy, has generated a 6% economic return for the fourth quarter and a 22% economic return since June 30, 2020. \u2047 The housing market is robust across America. \u2047 The Federal Reserve has been very supportive of agency mortgage-backed securities with open market purchases for its own portfolio. \u2047 The Fed's purchases have helped lenders offer low mortgage rates to homeowners for new home purchases as well as lowering the cost of homeownership for those that desire to refinance. \u2047 The National Association of Realtors recently reported that in December, contract closing for existing homes increased with annualized pace of 6.76 million units. \u2047 This is the strongest pace we have seen since late 2006. \u2047 Housing inventories are low, demand is strong and mortgage rates are at all-time historic lows. \u2047 These are all indicators for continued performance in the housing and residential mortgage credit. \u2047 Chimera has a unique and differentiated residential credit portfolio among mortgage REITs. \u2047 At year-end, our GAAP investment portfolio included $12.6 billion of mortgage loans and $2.5 billion of non-agency RMBS. \u2047 Over 90% of the loans in non-agency securities on our balance sheet were originated prior to 2010. \u2047 With strong underlying housing fundamentals and the prospects of a post-pandemic economic recovery, we believe our seasoned mortgage portfolio of loans in non-agency RMBS is uniquely positioned to perform well. \u2047 The securitization market has demonstrated depth and resiliency in the past year and is a key component of our company's liability management. \u2047 Spreads on securitized mortgage loans widened as the pandemic began in the spring of 2020. \u2047 Subsequently, these spreads have grown tighter and closed the year at historically low levels. \u2047 Securitization enables us to finance our mortgage loans for longer term by transferring them from our loan warehouse into mortgage trust as we sell senior notes in each deal. \u2047 This process helps the company to accomplish a desired asset liability mix, while providing long-term nonrecourse financing. \u2047 For the full year, we sponsored seven reperforming loan securitizations, two prime jumbo securitizations, one agency eligible investor loan securitization and one non-performing loan securitization. \u2047 In total, Chimera sponsored $4.2 billion and 11 separate securitized deals for the calendar year 2020, and we retained $655 million in subordinate notes. \u2047 Securitization is Chimera's primary source of financing for our loan portfolio, and as of year-end, securitized debt represented more than 60% of Chimera's liabilities. \u2047 We firmly believe that retention of subordinate notes from Chimera-sponsored deals provides the best levered returns available in the market. \u2047 Secondarily, we utilized repo and other forms of secured financing for warehouse loans and subordinate notes as we seek to enhance our portfolio returns. \u2047 Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken aggressive actions to reduce Chimera's financing risk by lengthening and strengthening our secured credit facilities. \u2047 At year-end, we have $3.2 billion of credit-related secured financings, which is 37% less than we were financing at the year-end 2019. \u2047 The average maturity of our credit-related financing is 15 months and $2 billion, or roughly two-thirds are either nonmark-to-market or limited mark-to-market. \u2047 In April, we issued convertible debt. \u2047 Concurrent with our offering, the company entered into a capped call transaction. \u2047 During the fourth quarter of 2020, we exercised a capped call option, and the company elected to receive a settlement of approximately 4.7 million shares for our common stock, which were then retired. \u2047 The retirement of these shares reduces the company's share count, benefiting the book value and future returns of our company. \u2047 Last night, our board of directors increased the size of our outstanding common stock repurchase authorization to 250 million. \u2047 This provides a valuable tool for our team as we evaluate the merits of new leverage investment opportunities related to the potential benefit of stock -- common stock repurchase. \u2047 Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain focused on delivering long-term value for shareholders. \u2047 Now, I would like to go through the fourth-quarter portfolio activity. \u2047 In October, we issued CIM 2020-R6, with $418 million of reperforming loans purchased in September. \u2047 The underlying loan from the deal had a weighted average coupon of 5.25% and a weighted average loan age of 164 months. \u2047 The average loan size in the R6 transaction was $102,000 and had an average LTV of 71%. \u2047 The average FICO score of the borrower was 638. \u2047 We sold 334 million senior securities from the deal and retained 84 million in subordinate notes, plus interest-only securities. \u2047 Our cost of debt for the CIM 2020-R6 was 2.19%, with an 80% advance rate. \u2047 In November, we issued CIM 2020-R7 and CIM 2020-NR1. \u2047 The R7 deal consisted of $653 million reperforming loans from the called CIM 2017-8 securitization. \u2047 The underlying loans in the deal had a weighted average coupon of 6.38% and a weighted average loan age of 172 months. \u2047 The average loan size in the R7 transaction was $81,000 and had an average LTV of 60%. \u2047 The average FICO score of the borrowers was 662. \u2047 We sold $552 million senior securities from the deal and retained $91 million in subordinated notes, plus interest-only securities. \u2047 Our cost of debt for the R7 deal was 2.22%, with an 86% advance rate. \u2047 The collateral for the NR1 securitization was $132 million of non-performing loans called from CIM 2017-8 deal. \u2047 The underlying loans had a weighted average coupon of 5.76% and a weighted average loan age of 170 months. \u2047 The average loan size was $100,000, had an 86 LTV and a 589 average FICO. \u2047 We sold $84 million notes, with a 4.49% cost of debt and a 64% advance rate. \u2047 Chimera retained $48 million of subordinate notes. \u2047 The R6, R7 and the NR1 deal were not rated by any of the rating agencies. \u2047 In December, we issued CIM 2020-J2, our second prime jumbo securitization for 2020. \u2047 The deal was rated by Moody's, Fitch and DBRS and had $327 million loans, with a weighted average coupon of 3.09% and a weighted average loan age of two months. \u2047 The average loan size was $912,000 and at an average FICO of 782 and an average LTV of 64%. \u2047 As we begin 2021, the housing market is booming, our mortgage portfolio continues to perform well, and we have ample cash position to make new investments. \u2047 Interest rates are at historic lows, and the securitization market is strong, with spreads on some classes near all-time tights. \u2047 This year, we will continue to seek ways to improve upon or lower our liability cost for securitized debt as well as the back-end financing of our retained securities from Chimera securitizations. \u2047 As of year-end, Chimera owns call rights from 7 billion in 16 previously issued same deals that are either currently callable or will become callable in 2021. \u2047 This provides a source of product to meet strong investor demand. \u2047 And lastly, our company's leverage is low. \u2047 As market conditions improve, we can increase our leverage either by growing assets, repurchasing equity or both. \u2047 Chimera is well positioned as we begin 2021. \u2047 We will use all the tools available to deliver the best risk-adjusted dividend to our shareholders. \u2047 I'll review Chimera's financial highlights for the fourth-quarter and full-year 2020. \u2047 GAAP book value at the end of the fourth quarter was $12.36 per share, and our economic return on GAAP book value was 6% based on the quarterly change in book value and the fourth-quarter dividend per common share. \u2047 GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $129 million or $0.49 per share and $15 million or $0.07 for the full year. \u2047 On a core basis, net income for the fourth quarter was $72 million or $0.29 per share, and it was $334 million or $1.46 per share for the full year. \u2047 Economic net interest income for the fourth quarter was $117 million, and it was $513 million for the full year. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, the yield on average interest earning assets was 5.9%, our average cost of funds was 3.6% and our net interest spread was 2.3%. \u2047 Total leverage for the fourth quarter was 3.6 to 1, while recourse leverage ended the quarter at 1.2 to 1. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, our economic net interest return on equity was 12.5%, and our GAAP return on average equity was 15.8%. \u2047 Expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding servicing fees and transaction expenses, were $18 million, up slightly from last quarter. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q4 core earnings per share $0.29.  \u2047  q4 core earnings per
