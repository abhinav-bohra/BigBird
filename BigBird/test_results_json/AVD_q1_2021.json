{"article": ["Before beginning, let's take a moment for our usual cautionary reminder. \u2047 Such factors can include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policy, competitive pressures and various other risks that are detailed in the Company's SEC reports and filings. \u2047 With net sales for Q1 up by over 20% and net income up by a factor of six, I'm pleased with our overall results. \u2047 This is a good start to the year and stands in stark contrast to Q1 of 2020 when the global pandemic started. \u2047 The bright spot for us was herbicides for corn, soybeans, fruits and vegetables, which recorded an increase of 86% in net sales and 60% increase in gross profit. \u2047 We enjoyed sales increases among our corn soil insecticides, however, they were offset by decreased sales in Bidrin, our cotton insecticide, as our customers work through inventories carried over from last year when there was low pest pressure. \u2047 Further, our soil fumigants sales declined by about 10%, due largely to water allocation issues in California. \u2047 Our non-crop business came on strong led by Dibrom, our mosquito adulticide, pest strips and increased license fees and royalties from our proprietary Envance solutions. \u2047 We continue to pursue expansion of the Envance portfolio into additional markets. \u2047 In our international business, we continue to see strong performance in Mexico, improvement in Brazil and higher gross margin in Central America. \u2047 Also our newly acquired Australian business, AgNova, performed very well and is providing both market access and a level of critical mass to Australia and the Pacific region. \u2047 Further, our newly acquired greenhouse business, which features a line of biological solutions for soil health, nutrient uptake and stress tolerance, fits well within our markets in the Americas and Australia and has given us expanded market access into India, China and Europe. \u2047 As David will elaborate, we continued to exercise financial discipline over the quarter. \u2047 While operating expenses rose on an absolute basis, they dropped as a percentage of sales from -- to 36% from 38% during the comparable quarter, thus we are seeing some economies of scale in our overall operations. \u2047 In addition, improved sales enabled us to reduce inventory levels when compared to the first quarter of 2020 despite the addition of the two new businesses. \u2047 Our factory overhead absorption was up slightly due largely to the addition of the two greenhouse plants. \u2047 We expect the factory efficiency will improve over the course of current year. \u2047 Finally, we finished the first quarter of 2021 with borrowing capacity of $51 million as compared to $36 million in the comparable period in 2020. \u2047 Next I would like to turn to David for his comments on our financial performance with a focus on matters of particular interest to our investors. \u2047 With regard to our public filing, we plan to file our Form 10-Q within the next few days. \u2047 As we have noted in previous calls, the Company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries in which we operate. \u2047 As a result, throughout 2020 and now into 2021, our customers and suppliers and our employees and operations have all continued more or less without disruption during the pandemic. \u2047 With regard to our sales performance for the first quarter of 2021, the Company's net sales increased by 21% to $116 million as compared to net sales of $96 million at this time last year. \u2047 Within that overall improvement, our U.S. sales increased by 18% to $72 million and our international sales increased by 27% to $44 million. \u2047 International sales accounted for 38% of total net sales as compared to 36% of net sales this time last year. \u2047 With regard to gross profit performance, our U.S. crop business recorded lower absolute gross profit on the increased sales. \u2047 There are few reasons. \u2047 First, we recorded lower manufacturing output compared to this time last year and lower factory recovery as a result. \u2047 We believe we will catch up during the balance of the year. \u2047 Second, we had lower sales of higher margin products, for example, those products associated with our cotton market and higher sales of some lower margin products. \u2047 Our non-crop gross margin approximately doubled as compared to the same quarter of the prior year. \u2047 There are two reasons. \u2047 First, as Eric mentioned -- has already mentioned, we had improved sales of our U.S. Dibrom products and our pest strips. \u2047 And second, we secured an extension to one of our Envance essential oil technology agreements and recorded increased royalties and license fees as a result. \u2047 With regard to our first quarter 2021 international sales, we saw increased sales and as a result, increased gross profit. \u2047 Half of the improvement was driven by the newly acquired businesses, AgNova in Australia and Agrinos biologicals business, which both generated margins above our international average. \u2047 In addition, our other international businesses benefited from an overall favorable mix of sales in the quarter. \u2047 Operating expenses for the quarter increased by 13% as compared to the same period of the prior year. \u2047 This included the addition of the activities of the two newly acquired businesses, which together accounted for approximately half of the increase. \u2047 Other increases included legal expenses, higher incentive compensation accruals linked to business performance and freight costs associated with volume and mix. \u2047 Offsetting these increases, we recorded lower marketing expenses and an improved performance on foreign exchange rates than in the comparable quarter of 2020. \u2047 Eric covered the sales performance and I followed up with comments on gross margin and operating expenses. \u2047 Together, these factors generated operating income that was twice the level reported for the same period of 2020. \u2047 From this statement, you can also see that during the first quarter, we recorded a gain on our equity investment in the business called Clean Seed, which has some exciting technology that fits well with our SIMPAS business. \u2047 We also recognized in other income the forgiveness of a payroll protection plan loan that we assumed upon the acquisition of the Agrinos biological business out of bankruptcy. \u2047 Finally, we recorded $560,000 lower interest expense in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period of 2020. \u2047 There were two factors. \u2047 First the rate on our loan is down as a result of U.S. policy to stimulate the economy. \u2047 And second, we have lower borrowings caused by 12 months of cash generation from our businesses offset by some acquisition activity. \u2047 Our income before tax is up 14 times in comparisons last year. \u2047 From a tax perspective, we had a very similar base rate for the quarter of 31%. \u2047 However, in 2020, we recorded very low taxable income. \u2047 And in addition, we have some benefits primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was not available in 2021. \u2047 All of these factors came together in the bottom line. \u2047 We are reporting $3.1 million, which is a six-fold increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Now I want to turn my attention to the balance sheet. \u2047 As you can see on this slide, we started 2021 with an improvement of 44% in the cash -- in cash generated by our activities. \u2047 Further you can see that working capital increased, which is normal at this point in the Company's annual cycle. \u2047 Plus we have two more businesses in 2021 as compared to the same quarter of 2020. \u2047 The main driver for the increase in the first quarter relates to accounts receivable. \u2047 You can see that in the statement of operations, our sales were up more than $20 million quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 As I noted at the start of my remarks, our customers have continued to operate without significant disruption throughout the pandemic. \u2047 They are placing orders for our products and making payments when expected. \u2047 We continue to monitor accounts receivable performance across our various businesses, both in the U.S. and abroad and can confirm that at this time we continue to experience a pretty stable credit risk position. \u2047 At the end of March 2021, our inventories were at $172 million, including about $8 million of inventory related to acquisitions completed since the end of the first quarter of the prior year. \u2047 This compares with inventories of $176 million this time last year. \u2047 So we feel that we have controlled inventory fairly well during this early phase in the Company's annual cycle. \u2047 Our current inventory target for the end of the financial year is $150 million, that compares with $164 million at the end of 2020. \u2047 That target is obviously dependent on a few things, including a continued low impact from the pandemic, normal weather patterns and no acquisitions. \u2047 With regard to liquidity, as you can see from this chart, we have been consistently moving debt down. \u2047 You can see that our position at the end of the first quarter is significantly better than at the end of the first quarter of the prior year. \u2047 Availability under the credit line has improved to $51 million at March 31, 2021, as compared to $36 million last year. \u2047 Our credit facility is scheduled to terminate in June of 2022 and we are already in discussions with our lead bankers regarding a reset on the facility to ensure that it does not go current at the end of the second quarter of this year. \u2047 In summary then, in the first quarter of 2021, we have increased sales by 21%, seen manufacturing output lower than the prior year and taken a higher level of under recovery factory costs as a consequence. \u2047 Overall margins have remained in the normal range for the company. \u2047 We have managed operating expenses, which increased in absolute terms, but reduced when expressed as a percentage of sales. \u2047 Our pre-tax income increased 14 times and net income six times. \u2047 From a balance sheet perspective, accounts receivable increased driven by strong sales growth. \u2047 Inventories increased, but to a lesser degree than last year including the impact of the addition of the two new businesses. \u2047 Debt increase but continues to track below prior year comparative periods. \u2047 And finally, availability under the Company's credit facility has improved. \u2047 We believe that this performance represents a good start to 2021. \u2047 With that, I want to turn to our growth initiatives beginning with our biological businesses. \u2047 As we've mentioned in the past, we have assembled multiple product lines globally, offering in soil health and biological solutions for farmers. \u2047 Presently, these products generate over $30 million in sales annually for us. \u2047 We have intentionally taken this direction in light of the fact that biological markets is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 10%, which is far higher than that of traditional crop protection in a second only to precision ag and projected growth in the ag sector. \u2047 Over the past few decades, industry has spent billions of dollars in R&D to develop these solutions, which, at first, were not widely accepted by growers. \u2047 However, the tide is turning and growers have increasingly embraced this technology. \u2047 Sustainability has become a vital consideration for farmers as farmland is considered their most precious asset. \u2047 Growers want to improve yield while ensuring that their soil is healthy both now and for future generations. \u2047 We are poised to address growers' demand with the portfolio globally of over 80 bio-solutions that enhance soil health and sustainable agriculture. \u2047 Let me now turn to technology and specifically to the subject of how our SIMPAS, Ultimus technology offers an unrivaled solution for the carbon credit market. \u2047 First, let me set the stage. \u2047 As you know, climate change has become a subject of enormous interest globally. \u2047 Along with infrastructure, it is one of the most important pillars of the current U.S. administration. \u2047 In the interest of addressing climate change within the ag industry, we have seen a proliferation of carbon credit markets globally, some private, some public, and each with its own set of rules and standards. \u2047 Within the past month, The Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2020 was introduced into the U.S. Senate. \u2047 Under the act, USDA will become the national authority for certifying both carbon credit programs and for verifiers for compliance with these programs. \u2047 Similarly, three days ago, the European Commission published their own guidance on carbon farming in which they stressed the importance of monitoring, reporting and verification or MRV, stating MRV is integral to result based carbon farming schemes as it is the step that quantifies the impact of climate actions that is the result. \u2047 In short, governments are moving at a rapid pace to organize and standardize the carbon credit markets and a common theme is that of MRV. \u2047 With that background, let me turn to our patented SIMPAS, Ultimus technology and explain why it is ideal solution for the carbon credit market. \u2047 The SIMPAS part of the technology is a precision application system that we have described before. \u2047 It's variable rate, multiple product dispensing system that enables grower to use only what is needed, precisely where it is needed on the field as per an agronomist prescription. \u2047 Further, SIMPAS is not limited to any particular type of input. \u2047 It can dispense crop protection products such as insecticides, nematicides, and fungicides as well as biologicals and nutritionals. \u2047 This season, planters using our SIMPAS technology will be treating 60,000 to 70,000 acres in the United States using our products alone while strategic partners are testing their own products. \u2047 In fact, I will now share a brief video that was shot two weeks ago by Asmus Farm Supply, a leading edge retailer located in Iowa, simultaneously applying insecticide, fungicide and micronutrient through their 24-row SIMPAS system. \u2047 Now let's turn to Ultimus, which through the use of RFID tags and our ISO[Phonetic] configured software platform, measures records and verifies the use of crop inputs. \u2047 When coupled with the permanent ledger system, such as blockchain, Ultimus record of these activities and transactions becomes immutable. \u2047 To demonstrate how SIMPAS, Ultimus can address the carbon credit market, allow me to use a concrete example. \u2047 Agrinos makes a product called iNvigorate, which is a consortium of 22 microbials that improve soil health while embracing the roots ability to absorb nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. \u2047 Let's say as a part of a carbon credit program, a farmer wants to reduce the use of nitrogen laden synthetic fertilizer. \u2047 With SIMPAS, Ultimus, by using iNvigorate and a less than full rate of synthetic fertilizer, the farmer could measure, record and verify the application and present the permanent record to the carbon program authority. \u2047 Interestingly, working with the University of Illinois in 2018, Agrinos conducted this very exercise and demonstrated using half rates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer on corn with iNvigorate generates the same yield as a full rate fertilizer alone. \u2047 One other point worth mentioning here is that in certain European nations, farmers are already being required to do a pre-plant soil analysis. \u2047 If they find a high level of"], "gold_summary": ["q1 sales $116 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings
