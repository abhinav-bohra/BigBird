{"article": ["So it was.com Kessel Stelling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will begin the call. \u2047 He will be followed by Jamie Gregory, Chief Financial Officer and Kevin Blair, President and Chief Operating Officer for more detailed information. \u2047 We ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. \u2047 During the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures related to the company's performance. \u2047 And now here's Kessel Stelling. \u2047 We have two main stories today and probably many more. \u2047 One is of our strong core operating performance for the first quarter pre and post coronavirus arrival. \u2047 The other equally important story is the strength and resilience of our company, which is again proven our ability to innovate to execute quickly and effectively manage day-to-day operations while also shifting priorities and resources to meet the emerging needs. \u2047 From the very beginning of this COVID-19 healthcare crisis, the decisions and actions taken by our team have been guided by two principles, doing what's best for the physical and financial well-being of our team members and doing what's best for our customers. \u2047 With those principles in mind, in March, our branches were converted to drive through and appointment only and we implemented aggressive cleaning, sanitizing, hygiene protocols at all of our company facilities. \u2047 More than 80% of 5,400 team members are now working from home and our IT team did a fabulous job quickly repositioning our workforce. \u2047 We've offered additional paid-time off the team members who are sick, who are quarantining or dealing with child care or other related family hardships and we're offering bonus payments to our hourly team members required to work on site to serve our customers. \u2047 To help our customers through this period of financial stress, we're waiting NSF and monthly service fees and offering payment the permit and other loan relief as appropriate. \u2047 Although social distancing is more or less eliminated the in-person hands on approach we usually take toward community service, we're doing everything we can to support needs across our footprint, including matching contributions to the American Red Cross, providing financial support for feeding America and funding meals for first responders and front-line healthcare providers. \u2047 I am especially proud of the effort our team has made to deliver paycheck protection program loans to our customers. \u2047 Since the launch of P3 on April 3, our team has processed, approved and funded more than $2 billion in loans for 8,300 customers. \u2047 We're continuing to process submissions in our pipeline, preparing to find as many as possible with the additional appropriations made available this week. \u2047 Kevin Blair will talk more about the key aspects of our COVID-19 response later in his remarks. \u2047 Before I cover highlights for the first quarter, I want to talk about our confidence in our ability to manage through this current crisis and to emerge from it in even stronger position. \u2047 Since the last crisis, our company has continually taken steps to prepare for an adverse economic environment including efforts to strengthen management in the key risk areas of capital credit and liquidity. \u2047 We routinely deploy stress testing and sensitivity analyzes to inform business decisions and we believe we're well positioned to sustain an economic downturn such as we're facing today. \u2047 On capital, our internal stress testing process gives us confidence in our ability to maintain strong capital ratios and stressed economic environments and our liquidity position remains strong. \u2047 We're also assessing and reprioritizing strategic initiatives under our Synovus forward program Kevin Blair is going to share more details later in the call on steps we're taking to ensure we're addressing the shorter term imperatives while also focusing on the right initiatives for strengthening our company long-term. \u2047 I'll briefly walk through highlights of the quarter on slide four. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.21 compared to $0.98 a year ago. \u2047 This year-over-year decline was driven by a 225 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate, the schedule loss of loan accretion from acquired loans and a significant increase to the allowance that accounts for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 under the CECL framework. \u2047 We were very pleased with the fundamentals of our core performance including period end loan growth of $1.1 billion, deposit growth of $1.4 billion and core transaction deposit growth of more than $600 million. \u2047 Core net interest income, which excludes purchase accounting adjustments was flat for the quarter. \u2047 However, the core net interest margin declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter, slightly more than our original expectations due to the more significant reduction in interest rates. \u2047 Adjusted non-interest revenue of $99 million grew $7 million from fourth quarter benefiting from significant activity in mortgage, capital markets and fiduciary businesses. \u2047 This was despite lower seasonal core banking fees and increased fee waivers as part of our effort to serve clients during this COVID-19 disruption. \u2047 Adjusted non-interest expense totaled $271 million for the quarter, up $6 million versus the previous quarter, largely due to the $5 million increase in seasonal payroll taxes that were referenced during our fourth quarter earnings call. \u2047 We also had an incremental $1 million in expenses associated with COVID related bonus payments for certain front line team members. \u2047 Provision for credit losses was $159 million and resulted in an allowance for credit losses ratio of 1.39%. \u2047 These metrics incorporate the impact from COVID and the first quarter of CECL. \u2047 Before I get started walking through the quarterly performance. \u2047 I'd like to highlight that we have withdrawn our 2020 guidance. \u2047 We will give some near term indications of financial performance on key metrics throughout my commentary and we are committed to reestablishing longer-term targets when the economy stabilizes. \u2047 We discussed our increased productivity a bit on the fourth quarter call and it continue on to the first quarter with $3.1 billion in total loan production. \u2047 Our Wholesale Banking team one boarded 155 new customers during the quarter, which represented $1 billion in new loans. \u2047 In March, we saw $300 million increase in line utilization. \u2047 C&I line utilization plateaued at 50% in March as some customers increased draw-out of an abundance of caution related to the economic situation. \u2047 We are confident in the credit quality of our growth this quarter as we remain disciplined in our underwriting. \u2047 In the second quarter, we expect loans from the paycheck protection program to serve as the primary engine for loan growth as additional pipelines have declined. \u2047 Rate cuts in March led to loan yields of 4.6% excluding purchase accounting a decline of 15 basis points from the prior quarter. \u2047 The full quarter impact of these March costs will have a greater impact on the average loan yields in the second quarter. \u2047 On adjusted for hedges, approximately 50% of our loans have a floating rate. \u2047 As previously discussed, we have a hedging program in place to help mitigate the impact of changes in short-term rates on our floating rate loan portfolio. \u2047 At quarter end, we had $2.8 billion in receipt fixed swaps associated with these hedges with an average rate of 1.4% versus one month LIBOR. \u2047 Slide six shows deposit growth of $1.4 billion, which included a continue to increases in core transaction deposits of $623 million. \u2047 In the first quarter, we took advantage of reduced pricing on wholesale broker deposits to increased balances and replace higher call single service deposits. \u2047 We will continue to monitor these markets for opportunities and while it remains a dynamic deposit environment and remain focused on growing our core deposit base and maintaining a prudent liquidity profile. \u2047 In terms of overall deposit pricing, we've certainly seen a response to the recent FOMC actions. \u2047 And as you can see our total interest-bearing cost in March were approximately 30 basis points lower than the average from the prior quarter. \u2047 In this easing cycle, the FOMC cut their target rate by 225 basis points and our general expectation is for cycle betas to end in the low to mid 30s as deposits repriced throughout the year. \u2047 As you can see on slide seven, net interest income of $373 million declined $26 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 The majority of that decline or $25 million was attributable to the expected decline in purchase accounting adjustments. \u2047 The core net interest margin, which excludes PAA decreased 5 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.35%. \u2047 As we look into the second quarter, we expect net interest income to remain relatively flat as a result of significant loan growth associated with P3. \u2047 However, this growth along with the depressed rate environment and an elevated cash position is expected to weigh on our net interest margin. \u2047 Excluding those impacts, we reiterate that we expect the margin to decline 4 basis points to 5 basis points per 25 basis point decrease. \u2047 We expect the majority of the impact from March rate cuts to be realized in the second quarter. \u2047 On slide eight, you will see that we have had continued success in fee revenue generation, which increased to $99 million adjusted. \u2047 That's an increase of $7 million from the prior quarter and up $21 million or 27% versus the prior year. \u2047 In the first quarter, we continue to have diversified strength in our fee revenue business. \u2047 Mortgage revenue driven by high production levels and elevated secondary gain on sale margins increased $3 million. \u2047 Capital markets volumes were higher by $2 million as our commercial clients locked in lower rates on their borrowings and income from brokerage grew $1 million, driven by increase in contributions of new hires in 2019 and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility. \u2047 These increases more than offset reductions in areas such as service charges on deposit accounts, primarily due to a decline in retail NSF fees. \u2047 However, COVID is already impacting customer behavior including significant declines in capital markets activity, lower debit and credit card transaction volumes and overall business disruption for commercial clients. \u2047 This disruption will likely result in fee revenue declining 15% to 25% in the second quarter from our recent run rate of approximately $90 million. \u2047 We would expect an increase in non-interest revenues as the economy stabilizes. \u2047 Moving to slide nine. \u2047 In the first quarter, non-interest expense was $276 million for $271 million adjusted. \u2047 Adjusted expenses increased $6 million from the prior quarter, generally in line with our prior guidance. \u2047 With the increased level of COVID related expenses, which we currently estimate of $5 million to $6 million in the second quarter we expect adjusted expenses to remain relatively stable quarter-on-quarter before declining in the second half of the year. \u2047 As Kevin will discuss in a moment, we remain confident that our efforts over the past six months to identify ways to improve our operating efficiency will result in positive operating leverage over the long-term. \u2047 We are tailoring the timing of our Synovus forward initiatives to ensure they do not distract from our focus on team members customers and communities. \u2047 This doesn't change our commitment to our strategy, it simply adjust the timing. \u2047 Slide 10 shows our credit quality metrics as well as the summary of our provision for credit losses and allowance. \u2047 Net charge-offs at 21 basis points remain within prior guidance. \u2047 The NPL ratio did increase from the prior quarter to 41 basis points and this is up 1 basis point from the prior year. \u2047 Additionally, past-dues return to the low end of the recent range at 22 basis points. \u2047 While we expect to experience stress in the portfolio as we progressed in the current economic environment, it is important to note that we are entering this downturn well positioned from a credit quality standpoint with NPAs, NPLs, past dues and charge-offs at or near lows for this economic cycle. \u2047 Provision for credit losses and allowance for the quarter were impacted by the adoption of CECL on January 1 which generally results in higher provision for credit losses compared to the incurred loss. \u2047 As you can see on slide 11, the day one reserve increase was $110 million or 39%. \u2047 We did a lag the five-year transition period for regulatory capital treatment. \u2047 Our 10-K reference the two-year reasonable and supportable period used in CECL estimate, but it was a more appropriate to reduce that for one-year horizon during this period of heightened economic uncertainty, a one-year reversion to the mean follows the reasonable and formal period. \u2047 The deterioration in the economic environment since January 1 due to the current healthcare crisis resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses ratio as of March 31st, then was modeled in the day one seasonal implementation and is currently at 1.39%. \u2047 Our modeling process incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations that are used to inform CECL estimates. \u2047 The internally developed economic forecasts used to determine the allowance for credit losses as of March 31 was approved on March 20. \u2047 At the time, the approved forecast line with rating agency and Wall Street economic forecast between that approval date and quarter-end, we saw further deterioration in the economic outlook, which resulted in the need for a qualitative overlay to our allowance for credit losses. \u2047 The qualitative overlay of $37 million at 10 basis points to the allowance for credit losses and better aligns the total allowance with the economic indicators and forecast at the end of the first quarter. \u2047 Significant economic uncertainty remains as a result of the continuing healthcare crisis and the ultimate impact of government stimulus efforts. \u2047 If our economic outlook on June 30 resembles these more recent forecast, we would expect to see further increase in the allowance for credit losses. \u2047 Capital ratios on slide 12 include the impact of CECL and incorporate applicable regulatory transition period. \u2047 As we've shared in the past, our target capital ratios were determined through our routine internal capital adequacy assessment process and include the capital optimization efforts completed in 2019. \u2047 These capital ratios give us comfort that even in a severely adverse scenario we have a sufficient buffer to withstand the losses and our main well capital. \u2047 In the first quarter, our CET1 ratio declined 8.72% largely due to the increase in risk-weighted assets, which accounted for a reduction of 25 basis points. \u2047 Our continued strength and PPNR generated 39 basis points of capital, which more than offset the 21 basis point impact of CECL related allowance build. \u2047 As a result of CECL, we anticipate capital ratio degradation earlier in a recessionary environment than under prior accounting guidance. \u2047 However, it is that allowance, which will provide a significant buffer to absorb any realized losses later in the cycle and affords us the ability to return to our capital targets over-time. \u2047 Currently, the allowance bill was reflected in the total risk-based capital ratio, which increased 6 basis points from the prior quarter to 12.31%. \u2047 Based on the same framework that was established and utilized for stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act, we continue to leverage our internal capital management processes. \u2047 These processes coupled with our risk appetite framework provide a road map and outlines capital preservation strategies in the event we see a more protracted period of economic weakness. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q1 adjusted earnings per share $0.21.  \u2047  withdrew
