{"article": ["We appreciate you joining us today to discuss Graham's Fiscal 2021 First Quarter Results. \u2047 We also have slides associated with the commentary that we are providing here today. \u2047 If you do not have the release or the slides, you can find them on the company's website at www. \u2047 Jeff will start with the financial overview of the period. \u2047 We will then open the lines for Q&A. \u2047 These documents can be found on our website or at www. \u2047 I also want to point out that during today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance. \u2047 This is Jeff actually. \u2047 As Jim and I have noted on our update calls in March and June, due to COVID-19 the COVID-19 pandemic, we've reduced our facility staffing to approximately 10% in late March and after implementing new work practices, enhanced cleaning and safety procedures and educating all of our employees on these changes, we gradually began to increase our staffing. \u2047 By the end of May, we were back at near-normal on-site staffing and have continued at that level over the past two months. \u2047 I want to compliment Alan Smith and his team for ensuring a safer production environment in this difficult time as well as our human resources team for their continued focus on improving safety in our workplace. \u2047 As a result of these proactive measures, our average production staffing and capacity for the first quarter was only 50%, and hence, our first quarter results suffered accordingly. \u2047 Sales in the first quarter were $16.7 million, which included a project in China, which had been delayed by COVID from the fourth quarter of last year into the first quarter of this year. \u2047 That project made up approximately 30% of the quarter's revenue. \u2047 On a positive note, our Defense or Navy sales were 21% of this total or $3.5 million. \u2047 We will be reporting the level of our Navy sales on a quarterly basis going forward, which for this year, we expect to be approximately 25% to 30% of total sales. \u2047 In the first quarter, we had a loss of $1.8 million or $0.18 per share. \u2047 As I noted, we ran at half capacity in Batavia. \u2047 Yet as discussed on prior calls, we continue to pay all of our employees their full benefits and wages. \u2047 We did not accept any PPP funding, so we consciously realized this type of loss would occur. \u2047 As Jim will discuss later, we view Q1 as a discrete event and assuming there are no significant impacts to our business or operations, the rest of fiscal 2021, we will be operating as normal in Q2 and beyond, and would expect far better results going forward. \u2047 Cash at the end of June was $67.2 million, and our backlog was $107.2 million, split evenly between defense and Commercial. \u2047 This strong backlog level supports our guidance for the rest of fiscal 2021. \u2047 On to slide five. \u2047 Sales in the first quarter were down $3.9 million. \u2047 Please note in Q1 of last year included $1.3 million from our Energy Steel business, which was sold in that quarter. \u2047 Gross profit, EBITDA and diluted earnings per share were all down significantly due to our low capacity level, yet more normal level of operating expenses, which occurred in the quarter. \u2047 Moving on to slide six. \u2047 Our cash position decreased to $5.8 million in Q1 to $67.2 million or $6.74 per share. \u2047 We expected this to occur, as I noted during our update call in late March, if we were shut down for a month, we would expect to utilize approximately $3 million of cash per month. \u2047 At 50% capacity in the quarter, this is equivalent to 1.5 months average shutdown, hence, the reduction in cash. \u2047 As with sales and profitability, we expect cash generation to be positive for the rest of fiscal 2021. \u2047 We paid $1.1 million of dividends in the quarter and it continues to be secure and an important part of our capital allocation provided directly back to shareholders. \u2047 Capital spending in the quarter was light at $300,000. \u2047 We expect capital for the full year to be in the $2.0 million to $2.5 million range. \u2047 Finally, our business development, management team and Board continue to be focused on utilizing our strong balance sheet to opportunistically identify and close on acquisitions, which have near and long-term benefits to our shareholders. \u2047 I would ask that you refer to slide nine. \u2047 $16.7 million of sales for the first quarter were negatively impacted by how we responded to the COVID-19 outbreak, which resulted in 50% reduction of our operating capacity. \u2047 During the first quarter, we developed and implemented COVID-19 protocols, which ensures that we would not experience such a low utilization rate for the remainder of FY 2021. \u2047 I am proud of the COVID return to work team and the entire company for returning the employees back to work safely and for following our newly implemented workplace safety practices. \u2047 Everyone has stepped up and responded well to this new reality we find ourselves in. \u2047 Highlights for the first quarter were that revenue from Defense projects was $3.5 million, which represents a year-on-year increase of $1.4 million. \u2047 As Jeff mentioned, we also completed a large project in China, which was responsible for approximately 30% of the quarter's revenue. \u2047 You may recall that this project due to COVID-19 fell out of the fourth quarter. \u2047 Moving on to slide nine. \u2047 While COVID-19 has impacted the demand for our products, there are several actions that are being implemented to ensure that we maximize the margin of the work that we will be converting this fiscal year. \u2047 COVID-19 has created a buyer's market for raw material. \u2047 Our supply chain has been very successful in securing materials at reduced costs. \u2047 I'm expecting that we will be able to continue to be in this position for the rest of the for the remainder of the year. \u2047 We are also focusing on growing our skilled workforce in order to increase our production volume. \u2047 To this end, we recently completed an expansion of our Weld School. \u2047 We now have the capacity to train up to eight welders up from 4. \u2047 We established our Weld School approximately five years ago, and it has proven to be a effective means to develop and grow our workforce. \u2047 Currently, we are prioritizing improving productivity in our Navy production area. \u2047 The company has completed many first time operations. \u2047 The productivity enhancements will stem from improved build flows, employee training, creating objective fixtures, and lastly, applying lessons learnt. \u2047 The IT department is developing tools, which will improve our ability to manage our global fabrication partners. \u2047 A management dashboard is being developed to track all aspects of our outsourced project. \u2047 This dashboard will aggregate information in-store on several IT platforms and will greatly improve the productivity of our project managers. \u2047 Finally, we are continuing efforts to grow our low-cost outsourcing capabilities, which will allow us to compete on projects where cost is the main decision driver. \u2047 I see these end market disruptions as an opportunity, to be clear, I just like the disruptions. \u2047 However, our attitude is to take advantage of them, invest in ourselves, improve our processes, gain productivity so that we come out stronger and performing better. \u2047 Our attitude is let's not waste the downturn by being a victim of it, but rather let's play offense to create benefits because of it. \u2047 I am referring to slide 11. \u2047 Jeff and Alan both provided good commentary about the impact to our financial results from the pandemic and price of crude oil. \u2047 It has also impacted order patterns. \u2047 Energy and petrochemical markets began to change adversely before the pandemic. \u2047 Fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year each had net orders of approximately $12 million. \u2047 There were no Defense orders during those two quarters. \u2047 Included in the net orders is $4 million of canceled orders and the impact of change orders. \u2047 It was rather even with $2 million of backlog deductions in each quarter. \u2047 The underlying bookings for new orders were a bit better than what is shown, however, still down considerably. \u2047 I have been through four downturns while at Graham, and now I'm in the fifth. \u2047 The each are challenging, went in them. \u2047 However, this current downturn feels rather different. \u2047 Customer behavior is less predictable this time. \u2047 I imagine that is because no one has experienced this type of demand disruption or turmoil in the past. \u2047 A couple of examples can illustrate well what we face. \u2047 We initiated bidding to replace a 40-year-old surface condenser in 2018. \u2047 It was urgent for the end user and end-of-life situation where the customer did not know if the unit would last another year. \u2047 Schedule was critical to meet a delivery window. \u2047 Order was finally ready to be placed this last quarter. \u2047 It was about a $2 million opportunity. \u2047 Due to focus on preserving cash, the plant advised that they cannot procure the unit now. \u2047 We offered in response, very favorable cash flow terms, we worked our supply chain for better costs, as Alan had mentioned, that then resulted in a lower price to the end user. \u2047 Corporate simply would not budge. \u2047 The risk of an unplanned shutdown or reduction in plant throughput is high, but cash preservation prevailed. \u2047 Any other time this would have been an order placed, put into our backlog and be a contributor to current year revenue. \u2047 Another example is a larger project, that's about $5 million for a refinery revamp. \u2047 Here too, we've been bidding it for a couple of years. \u2047 Learned last quarter, it was to be pushed out another year. \u2047 While four weeks ago, we got reengaged with the EPC that needed our engineering and to complete their plant layout and structural design. \u2047 In response, we proposed an engineering-only order. \u2047 We did a call this week that corporate is likely to sponsor final investment decision and now the full orders back in play for fiscal '22 revenue. \u2047 The order is now projected to close this quarter, and everything is hurried to get it done. \u2047 Will it actually proceed or perhaps there might be an order placed that subsequently is canceled, like we have experienced in the recent couple of quarters? \u2047 I simply don't know. \u2047 It's difficult to predict. \u2047 I offer these two examples to convey order patterns may be unpredictable and lumpy. \u2047 We have no control over the direction of our end markets, and little influence over the decisions a customer may make regarding will a project received funding. \u2047 I can convey, though, that we are on top of the available opportunities, controlling well that which we can control which is how we support customers, manage opportunities, differentiate from the competition with our speed, our knowledge sharing, options analysis that we provide, and ultimately, get our company in a position to win should an order get placed. \u2047 We may not take an order at a particular price, but the job of our sales team and that team does it well, is to get Graham in a position to accept or decline an order. \u2047 Even today, our naval bid pipeline is unpredictable, more so over timing, but it's still as difficult to define within a quarter when an order is going to be placed from the U.S. Navy or their prime contractors. \u2047 Moving on to slide 12. \u2047 Just stepping through our different key end markets. \u2047 Refining is down in North America across our three segments, which would be the integrated refiner, the independent refiner and also the MRO segment, spares and parts that's down. \u2047 In Asia, we do see a pretty active pipeline for new capacity that would be for India, China or elsewhere in Asia. \u2047 For the Middle East, or Latin America, there's really nothing significant in our pipeline right now. \u2047 We think those new capacity opportunities will present themselves after fiscal 2021. \u2047 For the U.S. Navy, we have a very healthy active bid pipeline across the three programs that we are in, the carrier program, the Virginia-class submarine program and also the Columbia-class program. \u2047 What's great in certain of these bids are for new components that aren't currently in backlog that we've not done. \u2047 So our focus on expanding our share of wallet is presenting opportunities that we hadn't seen previously, and then we're going to go after those and hopefully win those. \u2047 Across the next three quarters, we anticipate somewhere between $30 million to $50 million of work would be placed by the Navy with the suppliers such as Graham, and hopefully, we will win a strong share of that. \u2047 In the chemical, petrochemical market. \u2047 As I cited with the one example of a bid opportunity, focuses on preserving cash, without demand had collapsed globally, this market is really focused on clamping down on capital spend expenditures, MRO expenditures and just conserving cash across 2021 sorry, calendar 2020 and across fiscal 2021. \u2047 We are beginning to see some early signs of the next wave of new ethylene capacity, and you might recall that we view ethylene as the as a surrogate for the overall chemical industry. \u2047 An important consideration at this point in time is we're trying to understand for the next wave, the relevance of North American investment. \u2047 It may not be as strong as this most recent wave that began in the 2012, 2013, '14 time frame. \u2047 On the short-cycle side, that seems to have pulled back 15% to 20%. \u2047 We are seeing some improvement on the spare parts side. \u2047 However, the OEM work, again, this is short-cycle work that seems to be off correlated to the global economy and end market demand collapse. \u2047 We are also involving ourselves in new markets or emerging markets, if you will, alternative energy markets, hydrogen fuel cell market plus natural gas, and also supercritical fluids. \u2047 We have certain technology. \u2047 These are high-pressure applications where our product line fits extraordinarily well. \u2047 These are not large orders. \u2047 The ASP is probably under average selling price is probably under $100,000 for that type of sale. \u2047 But it's a very nice bread and butter work. \u2047 And we're focused on our participation in securing a presence in these new emerging markets. \u2047 Let's move on to the next slide, slide 13. \u2047 Our balance sheet and also backlog position entering this downturn are both beneficial. \u2047 After the first quarter, which we do consider an event isolated to that quarter, we get back into backlog conversion in the second quarter and hit stronger conversion in the third and fourth quarters. \u2047 $107 million of backlog as of June 30 is terrific to have. \u2047 70% to 75% of that backlog is planned to convert over the next 12 months. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 loss per share $0.18.  \u2047  q1 sales $16.7 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $14.2 million.
