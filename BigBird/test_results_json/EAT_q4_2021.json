{"article": ["During our call, management may discuss certain items, which are not based entirely on historical facts. \u2047 And of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. \u2047 Brinker's fourth quarter was one of our more profitable quarters in recent history, marking a solid finish to a successful, albeit unusual year. \u2047 Underpinning our fiscal '21 results is a consistent strategy that differentiates us in the marketplace and an exceptional team that executes every day in our restaurants. \u2047 We were already growing sales and taking share before the pandemic hit, and we made the decision to lean further into our strategy of providing convenience, value, and a great guest experience by doubling down on third-party delivery and improving our take-out systems. \u2047 In a year of social distancing, our teams came together safely to lead the industry on traffic and regained positive sales momentum. \u2047 In a year of closures and shutdowns, we opened our first virtual brand in over 1,000 restaurants by leveraging our technological infrastructure, It's Just Wings surpassed our $150 million target in our company-owned restaurants. \u2047 And along with the support of our franchise partners, It's Just Wings became more than $170 million business in the U.S., with many of our international franchisees also now operating the brand. \u2047 In a year that started with unemployment near record highs, we kept all our management teams employed and paid them solid bonuses. \u2047 We put a retention plan in place for our strongest team members to encourage them to stay with us as the staffing environment continued to change through the spring and summer. \u2047 In a year where gatherings and special occasions at Maggiano's were restricted, Steve and the team restructured the value proposition, the takeout proposition, and reengineered the Heart of House. \u2047 The brand is already delivering much more profitable sales as volumes come back and guests have responded very positively to the changes. \u2047 In a year, we thought we might have to borrow money more to survive the pandemic, we paid down our debt by over $300 million and we're committed to continuing that trend this year. \u2047 And in a year where we worried we wouldn't be able to support our charitable partners at levels we're used to, our team set a record, raising more than $10 million for St. Jude during an exceptionally critical time for their patients and families. \u2047 Our teams have raised nearly $90 million for St. Jude's patients during our partnership. \u2047 In fact, we've positioned ourselves to invest aggressively to grow this business during fiscal '22 and beyond and to keep our balance sheet strong. \u2047 The ability to make these kinds of investments starts with owning our restaurants; having the opportunity to leverage our fleet and realize the full potential -- the full profitability of our efforts. \u2047 The pandemic solidified our commitment to corporate ownership. \u2047 Despite the challenges of owning restaurants like dealing with labor issues and commodity cycles because ownership gives us the scale to effectively manage the issues, it allows us to steward our brands consistently and have control over the investments we make to grow the business. \u2047 This year, our investments will target more ways to offer convenience, value, and a great guest experience. \u2047 By doubling our pipeline of new restaurant openings, reimagining to keep our assets strong and vibrant, accelerating our technology advantages, and expanding our portfolio of brands. \u2047 Currently, we're in the middle of rolling out our second virtual brand, Maggiano's Italian Classics. \u2047 It's now in over 250 restaurants today and doing very well. \u2047 This one will be a slower roll for a couple of reasons. \u2047 It's a little more complex. \u2047 And since we're back to fully operational dining rooms, we're being very intentional about the experience for our operators and our guests. \u2047 We're excited about it. \u2047 We're getting great guest feedback, and we're anticipating being in restaurants 900 restaurants by the end of the fiscal year. \u2047 We're also investing in both takeout and delivery by pursuing opportunities to increase visibility and drive awareness of these channels across all four of our brands. \u2047 We recently implemented technology enhancements to our curbside takeout system, which is already simplifying the operational side of the business and improving guest metrics. \u2047 It's Just Wings has gone live with a website that offers online ordering for takeout as well as delivery, and we're excited about the growth potential for the brand. \u2047 These technology investments are helping us do a better job handling the increased mix of off-premise business from pre-pandemic mid-teens to what's now more than 30%, and as well as leveraging the full capacity of our assets with very little incremental capital. \u2047 It isn't every day you more than double your off-premise business and add a couple of brands to your base. \u2047 It only happens well with best-in-class systems to enable it and a strong team to execute it. \u2047 Our team is critical to our success, and we take the current staffing environment very seriously. \u2047 We've executed a full-court press to hire, train and retain our talent. \u2047 While the challenges came fast and furious for all of us in March, I'm pleased with the progress we've made. \u2047 There are still opportunities, but isolated to specific trade areas, and we're confident we'll get these staffing challenges resolved in the near future. \u2047 To further support our operators, we're rolling out a new service system with handheld devices that we've worked on for three years to perfect. \u2047 It isn't as easy as some might claim it. \u2047 To implement a system that operators can execute during high volume that saves labor and still delivers a great guest experience. \u2047 Ours is also putting more money in our team members' pockets, so they're staying with us longer, which is crucial in this environment. \u2047 It's in more than 250 restaurants now, and we anticipate full implementation by November. \u2047 And finally, because we chose not to take price at Chili's during fiscal '21, we have room to take some price this year as consumers return to work and income levels return to normal. \u2047 We're evaluating how we'll address those opportunities, especially in channels like delivery while all while protecting our industry-leading value proposition. \u2047 We spent last year learning to run a much more efficient and robust revenue-generating model. \u2047 We're spending this year and beyond capitalizing on the opportunities for growth that are not just available, but achievable for Brinker. \u2047 There's nobody who's doing this better than this team, and I'm honored to be part of their story. \u2047 As Wyman indicated, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to our fiscal-year 2021. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, Brinker reported total revenues of $1.009 billion, with a consolidated comp sales of 65%. \u2047 In keeping with our ongoing strategy, the majority of these sales were driven by traffic, up 53% for the quarter, a 10% beat versus the industry on a two-year basis. \u2047 These sales translated into solid earnings per share with fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.68. \u2047 At the brand level, Chili's comparable restaurant sales were positive 8.5% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal-year '19, which we believe is the more appropriate comparison for the quarter. \u2047 Additionally, on an absolute dollar basis, the fourth quarter was Chili's largest sales quarter on record, topping $900 million in total revenue. \u2047 Maggiano's, while down 18% compared to fourth quarter of fiscal '19, made very solid progress with its recovery curve and built positive momentum to carry into the current fiscal year. \u2047 Moving down the P&L. \u2047 Our fourth-quarter restaurant operating margin was 16.9%. \u2047 Adjusting this performance for the impact of the 53rd week, the resulting 16% operating margin still represents a material year-over-year improvement and more importantly was a 110-basis-point margin improvement versus the pre-COVID fourth quarter of fiscal '19. \u2047 Food and beverage expense for the fourth quarter as a percent of company sales was 20 basis points unfavorable as compared to prior year. \u2047 This variance was driven -- primarily driven by increased commodity costs, particularly for chicken and pork products. \u2047 Labor expense for the quarter, again, as a percent of company sales was favorable 240 basis points versus prior year, primarily driven by the extra week sales leverage versus fixed labor expenses and the slower reopening pace in a couple of high wage states such as California. \u2047 During the quarter, our managers focused considerable efforts toward staffing our restaurants to support the solid demand for our brands. \u2047 Scale clearly matters in this area, as they were effectively supported by our experienced HR teams who help deploy hiring tools and events to assist in the process. \u2047 Given the more challenging hiring environment, the dynamic of hiring, training, and retaining team members resulted in an increase in labor inflation in the mid-single-digit range, a dynamic we expect to continue in the near term. \u2047 To reward our operator's strong performance throughout the fiscal year, we also chose to further invest in our hourly team members and managers through a variety of incremental bonus structures, totaling approximately $4 million for the quarter beyond our normal payout formulas. \u2047 This incremental investment impacted quarterly earnings per share by approximately $0.06 and increased labor expense margin by roughly 40 basis points, well worth the benefits it will accrue. \u2047 Restaurant expense was 830 basis points favorable year over year as we fully leveraged many of our fixed costs, particularly from the benefit of the additional week in the quarter. \u2047 The continued positive operating performance did result in a meaningful increase in our quarterly tax rate, 15% for the quarter, which includes a catch-up adjustment to increase the annual income tax accrual. \u2047 This increase negatively impacted fourth-quarter earnings per share approximately $0.06. \u2047 Our operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and fiscal year remained strong with $101 million and $370 million for those time frames, respectively. \u2047 EBITDA for the quarter totaled $144 million, bringing the fiscal-year EBITDA total to $368 million. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we continued to use a significant portion of our cash flow to further reduce revolver borrowings. \u2047 By year-end, our revolver balance was reduced to $171 million. \u2047 This decreased our total funded debt leverage to 2.5 times and our lease-adjusted leverage to 3.6 times at year end. \u2047 Speaking of the revolver, we have reached agreement on terms and conditions for a new revolving credit facility with our bank group. \u2047 The new $800 million five-year revolver includes improved pricing allows the return of restricted payments and provides ample liquidity and flexibility to support our growth strategies. \u2047 Our board of directors has also reinstated the share repurchase authorization that was suspended in the early days of the pandemic with an authorization amount of $300 million. \u2047 Now turning to our outlook for fiscal-year '22. \u2047 At this point, with the volatility and unknowns of the current operating environment, we can only share some high-level thoughts for certain annual metrics. \u2047 For example, we expect commodity and labor inflation percentages each in the mid-single digits with commodity inflation toward the lower end of the range. \u2047 Capex of $155 million to $165 million, an annual effective tax rate of 14% to 15%, and weighted annual share count of 45 million to 47 million shares. \u2047 As we now move ahead with fiscal 2022, the reality of the pandemic with all its uncertainties is still part of our everyday operations. \u2047 That being said, all now four of our brands are well prepared and positioned to perform in whatever environment they face throughout the year. \u2047 We are very proud of their efforts during the past fiscal year and are confident of the experiences, the growth, and the strength of their business models will continue to deliver quality results as we move forward from here. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["qtrly net income per diluted
