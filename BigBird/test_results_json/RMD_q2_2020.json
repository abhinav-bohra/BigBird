{"article": ["Sorry for that, we were having a few audio issues. \u2047 So we've redialed back in. \u2047 Joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are CEO, Mick Farrell and CFO, Brett Sandercock. \u2047 Other members of management will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. \u2047 During our call, we will discuss several non-GAAP measures. \u2047 We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. \u2047 However, our actual results may differ. \u2047 I'll then review top level financial results, some business highlights from the quarter, and a few key milestones. \u2047 Then I'll hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financials in further detail. \u2047 Our team achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth across the portfolio driven by superb performance in the mask category particularly in the U.S. market with good performance across the 140 countries where we provide our solutions. \u2047 We continue to take market share with our software solutions that enable increased therapy adherence with resupply programs providing support to those who need it and with our innovative new products. \u2047 Customers are voting with their wallets and they are voting for ResMed. \u2047 As the world's leading software-driven medical device company, we are using digital health technology to transform the industry. \u2047 We have sold nearly 11 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market and Air Solutions, our cloud-based ecosystem manages more than 12 million patients. \u2047 In the last 12 months, we have changed over 15 million lives by providing a person with a ResMed device or complete ResMed mask system to help them breathe better and live better lives. \u2047 In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems are helping to manage 19[Phonetic] million more people outside the hospital. \u2047 Digital health technology is an integrator across everything that ResMed does. \u2047 AirView, myAir, Propeller and a portfolio of other digital health solutions allow us to better engage with our customers and partners, including patients, physicians, providers, payers and complete healthcare systems. \u2047 We are investing in advanced analytics and expanding our capabilities in machine learning and machine intelligence so that we can grow this digital health ecosystem at double digits on a volume basis. \u2047 We now have over 5.5 billion nights of respiratory medical data in the cloud and we are analyzing these data to derive actionable insights for the benefit of patients, physicians, providers and healthcare systems. \u2047 Our relentless focus on product and software innovation continues to set us apart from our competition. \u2047 We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money and to help achieve better management of chronic disease. \u2047 We believe that the future of healthcare is outside the hospital. \u2047 That's where ResMed's competes today and that's where we are winning today. \u2047 We have the right elements in place to achieve our strategy and to drive financial success as we provide market leading value to customers. \u2047 Let's now briefly review our top level financial results. \u2047 We achieved another quarter of double digit revenue growth. \u2047 We were up 14% in constant currency across our portfolio. \u2047 This growth continues to be well balanced across our domestic U.S. as well as our global product sales as well as from our software as a service businesses. \u2047 We continue to deliver operating leverage with non-GAAP operating profit growth of 21% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.21. \u2047 I'd like to focus now on our core sleep apnea and respiratory care businesses. \u2047 In the devices category, we delivered a good quarter with year-over-year constant currency device growth of 8% globally supported by strong 9% device growth in the United States, Canada and Latin America geographies, as well as by improving, Europe, Asia and rest of world growth, which was at 6% constant currency in the device category. \u2047 We continue to face headwinds for device growth in France as a result of the 2018 and 2019 digital health-related fleet upgrades. \u2047 We expect that the headwinds will begin to abate in the upcoming European summer and we will start to return to market growth for devices in France during fiscal year 2021. \u2047 Underlying patient growth remains healthy around the globe and we continue to benefit from strong market dynamics with over 900 million people worldwide suffering from undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea. \u2047 Growth in the masks and accessories category of our business was incredibly strong during the quarter. \u2047 We were up 16% constant currency globally in this category, well ahead of market growth rates, indicating that we gained significant market share with our latest patient interface innovations. \u2047 Removing the impact of some software within this category, we are still growing our global mask franchise in the mid teens. \u2047 Our flagship masks, the AirFit F20 and the AirFit N20 continue their growth across global markets. \u2047 The success of these masks was augmented by continued good uptake of our more recent masks launches. \u2047 We have launched a steady rhythm of mask innovation over the past 15 months. \u2047 We have just lapsed the successful launch of the F30 in the December quarter and we will lap the launch of the N30 the N30i and the P30i during the coming 12 months. \u2047 The F30i was launched just over a week ago combining the needs for patients in the freedom and the minimalist mask segments. \u2047 With our portfolio of solutions, we are ensuring that we have the right mask for every patient, every time. \u2047 We are innovating and expanding our mask portfolio to offer comprehensive options for physicians and home care providers and for the specific needs of the ultimate customer and that's the person who suffocates every night with sleep apnea. \u2047 We remain focused on driving innovation to meet underserved customer needs. \u2047 We are creating future products that are smaller, quieter, more comfortable, and more customized to each persons needs. \u2047 Through digital health technologies such as the myAir app, we are driving patient engagement with our therapy so that people can enjoy the benefits of better breathing and better sleep. \u2047 We have well over 2 million patients using myAir and leveraging its insights and personalized feedback through coaching algorithms. \u2047 In parallel, we are also ensuring that the cost of sleep apnea as a chronic disease can be better managed by physicians, providers, payers, and healthcare systems. \u2047 Our digital end-to-end solutions combined with available 100% cloud connectivity as well as information provided to patients on their own smartphones are all leading to significant improvements in cost, improvements in healthcare outcomes, and improvements in quality of life. \u2047 We believe cloud-based software combined with world-leading medical devices can add value and improve both clinical outcomes as well as the patient experience. \u2047 On the partnership front, our joint venture with Verily is creating software solutions to help identify and engage and enroll people with sleep apnea on a journey to better sleep and better breathing. \u2047 We have commenced pilots in a handful of U.S. cities to improve awareness, identification, and engagement with the importance of good sleep and breathing to overall health. \u2047 Our philosophy is this, the more a person knows about how much they suffocate every night and the consequences of that suffocation on their overall health outcomes, the more likely they will seek solutions. \u2047 At its simplest level, this partnership will drive incremental growth in our core sleep apnea business. \u2047 Over the longer-term and on a deeper level, this partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond. \u2047 I'd like to now focus on our business in respiratory care. \u2047 There are nearly 400 million people suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD worldwide. \u2047 We don't believe these people are well served by global healthcare systems today and many COPD patients are frequent visitors to hospital emergency rooms with admissions and frequent readmissions. \u2047 We have a vision to better manage COPD patients through the use of technology with digital end-to-end solutions, technology such as our Propeller platform helps how patients are communicated to, it helps how they are encouraged in their medical care and it helps how folks are looked after as an individual person. \u2047 We believe that technology combined with world-leading medical equipment can add substantial value to improve both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. \u2047 We plan to offer a portfolio of solutions through all stages of COPD progression. \u2047 We will be there with stage 1 and stage 2 COPD patients as they commence inhaled pharmaceutical therapy managed by the Propeller platform. \u2047 We will be there with stage 2 and stage 3 COPD patients as they add portable oxygen therapy to their care. \u2047 We will also be there with stage 3 and stage 4 COPD patients as they commence non-invasive ventilation therapy and ultimately life support ventilation therapy. \u2047 We will manage the person on one end-to-end digital health COPD platform, helping the patients, helping their caregivers and loved ones as well as helping their physicians and providers so that they have the right information at the right time, lowering costs and improving outcomes. \u2047 Our team at Propeller continues to progress their business as we move along the path from pilot trials to commercial partnerships with both pharmaceutical partners and healthcare systems. \u2047 The digital health opportunity with inhaled respiratory medicine adherence will take time to build and we are making good progress. \u2047 In December, Propeller was included as the only chronic respiratory disease solution in Express Scripts' first formulary for digital health solutions. \u2047 In November, access for Propeller users was expanded to pharmacy services from CVS, from Walmart, from Kroger, and from Rite Aid. \u2047 This was accessed directly from the Propeller app via the My Pharmacy feature within that smartphone application. \u2047 We will update you on the milestones for Propeller with partners in both pharma as well as healthcare systems as we move forward throughout 2020. \u2047 Finally, I'd like to focus on our software as a service business. \u2047 We continue to integrate and optimize the out of hospital SaaS portfolio for long-term growth. \u2047 We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantage as the only strategic player competing with leading software solutions focused on home medical equipment providers, skilled nursing facilities as well as home health and hospice providers. \u2047 Our SaaS portfolio revenue grew 37% year-on-year this last quarter, benefiting from the MatrixCare acquisition that we lapped during November. \u2047 We estimate that the weighted average market growth rate of these sectors we compete in is in the high-single digits. \u2047 Excluding the timing benefit of the MatrixCare acquisition and on a pro forma basis, our SaaS portfolio grew in line with market in Q2. \u2047 Our plan is to beat that market growth rate over the medium to long-term. \u2047 As we reached the fourth anniversary of our Brightree acquisition here in 2020, we are achieving strong [Technical Issues] in our home medical equipment or HME sector with our Brightree team in Atlanta. \u2047 We just passed the one-year anniversary with our MatrixCare acquisition in the quarter and we are increasing our investments in our MatrixCare team up there in Minneapolis. \u2047 This investment is focused on new module introduction for our MatrixCare platform so that we can ensure that we are able to grow and share in our skilled nursing facility as well as home health and hospice sectors as we move forward. \u2047 We are doing the hard work to make MatrixCare as successful as Brightree is in the ResMed portfolio and we have all the elements in place to do that. \u2047 It took around 24 months to see strong sustainable returns from our investments in R&D and our management team at Brightree. \u2047 We think we can meet or beat that timeline for strong and sustainable returns from our MatrixCare investments that we are currently making. \u2047 Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with Cerner as their new preferred partner for home health and hospice software for Cerner's customers. \u2047 It is early days in that partnership and things are going very well. \u2047 We've started to migrate existing home health and hospice customers to our MatrixCare solution. \u2047 Our sales team is actively engaged with Cerner's sales team with customers learning of the benefits of our MatrixCare home health and hospice software. \u2047 We are excited to drive growth from this partnership. \u2047 The rich interoperability between our two solutions will provide value for both Cerner and ResMed customers as well as their patients and residents. \u2047 I would like to take a moment to announce an exciting technology tuck-in acquisition that we are just in process of completing. \u2047 Just this week, Brightree signed an agreement to acquire a company called SnapWorx. \u2047 SnapWorx is a privately held software company that provides patient contact management and workflow optimization for sleep apnea resupply. \u2047 The combination of Brightree's technology and live call services with this new SnapWorx technology creates the largest resupply base in the industry with end-to-end workflow automation. \u2047 For our HME customers, the combination of these two technologies Brightree and SnapWorx will increase patient adherence and increase operational efficiency. \u2047 We expect the transaction to close very shortly. \u2047 The acquisition of SnapWorx is expected to be neutral to our non-GAAP ResMed earnings per share initially. \u2047 However, we expect this acquisition will be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share during fiscal year 2021. \u2047 In summary, we have the vision to transform and significantly improve software solutions across outside the hospital healthcare sectors. \u2047 We see a future [Technical Issues] of hospital care. \u2047 The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD, and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year. \u2047 We have positioned ResMed for the long-term as the global leader in digital health driving top line and bottom line growth as we execute toward our 2025 strategy. \u2047 We are focused on our triple aim. \u2047 First, to slow chronic disease progression; second, to reduce overall healthcare system costs; and third, to improve quality of life for the ultimate customer, the patient. \u2047 With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett in Sydney for his remarks and then we'll go to Q&A. \u2047 In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. \u2047 As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. \u2047 Group revenue for the December quarter was $736 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. \u2047 In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. \u2047 Excluding revenue from acquisitions, group revenue increased by 11% on a constant currency basis. \u2047 Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our software as a service business, our sales in"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 non-gaap
