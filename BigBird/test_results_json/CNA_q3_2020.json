{"article": ["It's very good to be with you today, and I hope you and your families are coping well. \u2047 Despite these unprecedented times, CNA continues to operate effectively, as our underlying business performance improved once again this quarter as evidenced by the ongoing acceleration in rate achievement, as well as higher overall growth and growth in new business. \u2047 We also had an improved underlying loss ratio and a lower expense ratio for the quarter. \u2047 As we have done in previous years, we completed our annual Life & Group review in the quarter, which importantly includes the long-term care gross premium valuation or GPV analysis of our active life reserves. \u2047 As part of our analysis, we took strong action to address the lower interest rate environment we now face compared to a year ago by conservatively modifying our discount rate assumptions. \u2047 First, we have lowered our expectation for the normative 10-year treasury yield to 2.75%, a reduction of 100 basis points from last year. \u2047 Second, we extended the time period to grade up to that normative rate from six years to 10 years. \u2047 Since long-term care reserves are discounted, these changes reflect our ongoing prudent approach to reserving and our steadfast resolve to protect our capital and earnings in an ongoing low interest rate environment. \u2047 Al will provide you with much more details associated with this year's GPV review. \u2047 Our underlying combined ratio of 92.6% for the quarter improved by 2 points from a year ago and is the lowest underlying combined ratio for CNA in the last 10 years. \u2047 The underlying loss ratio improvement consisted of only 0.5 point benefit due to lower frequency from the ongoing economic downturn, with most of the improvement driven by our International business, which has steadily returned to profitability as a result of our reunderwriting efforts in our London operation over the last 18 months. \u2047 As I mentioned in the last quarter, we expected only a relatively modest impact from loss frequency benefit because a substantial portion of our portfolio consists of insureds in essential industries such as construction, healthcare and manufacturing that were not subject to shelter-in-place restrictions. \u2047 And we continue to assume a potential for higher severity and casualty lines, like auto and general liability, as the economy is restored over time. \u2047 So, we believe it is still early to react too favorably to the short-term trends. \u2047 The lower P&C expense ratio of 31.8% largely reflected our growing premium base, which contributed approximately 0.7 points of the improvement in our underlying combined ratio. \u2047 As I have said on prior calls, our strategy has been to simultaneously make substantial investments in talent, technology and analytics to position us for sustained success while streamlining our operation in order to keep our overall underwriting expenses flat. \u2047 Then, by growing the Company in a disciplined and prudent fashion, we would steadily decrease the expense ratio, which you can clearly see in this quarter as more of the growth earned in. \u2047 Turning to the dynamics of this hard market and starting with pricing, rate increases continued to accelerate as we achieved plus 12% in P&C overall, up 1 point from the second quarter. \u2047 Importantly, excluding workers' comp, which had slightly negative rate and our very profitable Affinity Programs, which had a small positive rate increase, the rate change was plus 17%, up 2 points from Q2 and 5 points from Q1. \u2047 Importantly, the increases apart from these two areas were broad-based at each business unit and essentially all product lines achieved higher rate. \u2047 The acceleration in our written rate increases over the last six quarters has led to four quarters of earned rate increases, now at plus 9%. \u2047 This compares to our long-run loss cost trend assumptions of slightly more than 4%, excluding our Affinity book. \u2047 As mentioned on our last call, we had previously increased our view of long-run loss cost trends in 2020, as we continued to feel the impact of social inflation on our portfolio, in particular in our aging services and auto portfolios. \u2047 In the quarter, we remained comfortable with our latest view and did not further need to increase them. \u2047 However, as I also mentioned last quarter, the impact of the pandemic could be up at scaling the social inflation dynamic. \u2047 The great news, however, is that all the dynamics fueling the hard market, which we and others have articulated repeatedly, should allow us to achieve strong rate increases well into 2021 so that the margin gap, all else equal, should continue to grow net of any added pressure from long-run loss cost trends in 2021. \u2047 And as we see this play out, over the next couple of quarters, we will then be in a better position to incorporate the benefit into our loss ratio picks. \u2047 In terms of growth, gross written premium, ex-captives, grew 9%, while net written premium growth was 7%, both higher than the second quarter. \u2047 Exposure continued to be a headwind to our growth as it was down 3 points compared to the third quarter last year. \u2047 As was the case in the second quarter, new business growth in the third quarter was again higher than the same period last year, which evidences our ability to provide strong service to our agents and brokers in this remote working environment. \u2047 The investments we made at the end of the first quarter to respond quickly to shorter time frames on submissions that I mentioned on the last call continued to pay dividends this quarter. \u2047 Retention declined 1 point from the second quarter to 82%, due to our reunderwriting efforts in our London operations, which will essentially be completed in the fourth quarter and to our targeted actions in the US to improve the profitability of certain lines within healthcare and manufacturing that I have spoken about previously. \u2047 Completing the picture for the quarter, our overall combined ratio was 100.9%, which included 0.4 points of favorable development and 8.7 points of loss activity from a series of natural catastrophe events. \u2047 In the quarter, there were no significant changes in the regulatory environment. \u2047 The claim notices we received in the third quarter have been modest and very little has been paid out. \u2047 Of course, that was our expectation all along, as we knew that claim outcomes from this event would play out slowly over time. \u2047 As a result, our previously established COVID-19 ultimate loss estimate of $195 million remains appropriate for all events that occurred through the third quarter, from which we believe claims will eventually emerge and our loss estimate is still virtually all in IBNR. \u2047 The overall portfolio fared well in the third quarter with the unrealized gain position increasing once again and net investment income was strong, driven by LP positions. \u2047 Despite this strong quarter, we continued to see a reduction in our net investment income from our fixed income portfolio supporting P&C, due to the lower interest rate environment that we believe is unlikely to change meaningfully anytime soon. \u2047 This is a key dynamic fueling my perspective for a protracted hard market, as it will take time for us in the industry to achieve an offsetting increase in underwriting income. \u2047 Finally, our core income for the third quarter was $193 million or $0.71 per share. \u2047 Net income was $213 million or $0.79 per share. \u2047 As Dino indicated, I will now provide details of our results by business segment. \u2047 Starting with Specialty, the combined ratio was 89.5% this quarter. \u2047 The combined ratio includes favorable prior-period development of 2 points and 1 point from catastrophe losses. \u2047 The favorable prior-period development was largely driven by continued strong profitability from the surety business, partially offset by unfavorable development in healthcare. \u2047 The underlying combined ratio for Specialty was 90.5% this quarter, 1.6 points of improvement compared to third quarter 2019. \u2047 The underlying loss ratio was 60%, and the expense ratio was 30.5%. \u2047 The expense ratio has improved by 1.3 points compared to third quarter 2019, due to both growth in net earned premium and lower expenses. \u2047 The gross written premium growth ex-captives was plus 11% in Specialty for the quarter and was 9% on net written premium. \u2047 Rates continued to increase at plus 13%, up from 11% last quarter. \u2047 Retention was 86% this quarter, which was flat to last quarter. \u2047 New business volume was strong with growth of 14% over the prior year's quarter. \u2047 The combined ratio for Commercial was 111.5% this quarter, which is 9.9 points higher than third quarter 2019 and includes 17 points of catastrophe losses and 0.6 points of unfavorable prior-period development. \u2047 The cat losses are attributable to severe weather-related events in the quarter, primarily Hurricanes Laura, Isaias, Sally and the Midwest derecho. \u2047 The underlying combined ratio for Commercial was 93.9% this quarter, 0.1 points higher than the third quarter of 2019, but 0.9 points improvement on a year-to-date basis versus prior. \u2047 The underlying loss ratio was 61%, compared to 61.5% in the prior year, reflecting a modest benefit from lower frequency in the quarter as Dino mentioned. \u2047 The expense ratio was 32.3% compared to 31.7% in the third quarter 2019. \u2047 The prior-year expense ratio included a release, especially with the state loss assessment fund, which is muting the favorable impact of current year net earned premium growth and lower expenses. \u2047 Gross written premium growth ex-captives was plus 7% in Commercial for the quarter and net was plus 4%. \u2047 The rate change of 11% was up 1 point from last quarter. \u2047 New business growth was down 3% versus prior quarter and up 8% on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 The combined ratio for International was 98.1% this quarter compared to 107.4% in the third quarter 2019. \u2047 The combined ratio includes 3 points of catastrophe losses for the quarter. \u2047 The underlying combined ratio for International was 95% this quarter, an improvement of 10.3 points compared to prior-year quarter. \u2047 The underlying loss ratio was 60.1%, and the expense ratio was 34.9%. \u2047 The underlying loss ratio improved 7.2 points, fueled by a reunderwriting execution, while expense ratio declined 3.1 points, driven by lower acquisition and underwriting expenses. \u2047 The gross written premium in International increased by 5% and net increased by 10%, both in comparison to the prior year. \u2047 The net written premium growth comparison to the prior period was impacted by a change in timing of our reinsurance treaty. \u2047 Rate change of 16% was up 2 points from prior quarter. \u2047 Retention was 70% this quarter, which is in line with 2019 levels and reflects the progression of the reunderwriting strategy. \u2047 More than five years ago, we commenced efforts focused on the active management of long-term care with the goal of reducing the risk of CNA, while also effectively serving our policyholders. \u2047 This encompass significant investment in the business and a commitment to proactively and effectively address risks. \u2047 We've made considerable progress on these objectives, including reducing risk across many dimensions of the block, achieving meaningful rate increases and taking pre-emptive actions on our reserving assumptions. \u2047 The actions we've taken with our 2020 annual review of our Life & Group reserves are reflective of this continued approach and commitment. \u2047 As a reminder, our annual Life & Group reserve reviews include the long-term care gross premium valuation or GPV of our active life reserves, as well as the long-term care claim reserve analysis. \u2047 In addition, we completed a claim reserve review for our structured settlements block, which I will also address. \u2047 Starting with the long-term care GPV review, the most significant change resulting from this review was an update of our discount rate assumptions. \u2047 These changes associated with the discount rate are detailed in Slides 14 and 15. \u2047 It is important to note that the discount rate is a function of the current investment portfolio yield as well as the reinvestment yield assumed for future investments. \u2047 The benchmark we use in reference to the risk-free reinvestment yield is the 10-year US Treasury. \u2047 While we're projecting risk-free rates over the short and intermediate term, we assume long-term rate or normative rate with a critical importance, given the duration of the liabilities. \u2047 In the previous two year's reserve reviews, we have reduced our expectations for the normative 10-year treasury yield by 105 basis points. \u2047 At our 2019 review, assuming that this benchmark rate will get to 3.75% by 2025, in light of the current interest rate environment and expectation with conditions persisting, we've taken several critical actions on our discounted assumptions. \u2047 First, we have lowered our expectation for the normative rate at 2.75%, a reduction of 100 basis points from last year and 205 basis points cumulatively over the last three years. \u2047 Second, we've extended the time period to grade up to a normative rate from six years to now 10 years. \u2047 This means that it's not until 2030 that we will assume the new 2.75% normative rate. \u2047 And finally, we are using the forward curve for the first three years of the projection and then we'll grade up to the normative rate over the remaining seven years. \u2047 You will see on Slide 15 that we're not assuming the tenure will get back to the 2% level until 2027, a significant change compared to our prior-year expectations. \u2047 I should also note, we did not make any meaningful changes to investment in spread assumptions or portfolio credit quality as part of this review. \u2047 The sum of all the assumption changes on the discount rate resulted in an unfavorable pre-tax impact of $609 million. \u2047 These discount rate changes, including the significant decrease in the normative rate, extended time frame to get to the new normative rate, and use of the forward curve over the next several years, reflects our prudent approach to reserving and meaningfully reduces the reinvestment risk assumed in these liabilities. \u2047 With that, I will move on to other key assumption changes, including morbidity, persistency and rate increases, all highlighted on Slide 16. \u2047 With respect to morbidity, along with the change in the level of interest rates, we also lowered our expectation of inflation. \u2047 This change impacts our assumption for cost of care for future claims and together with other morbidity assumptions, had a favorable pre-tax impact of $51 million. \u2047 With respect to persistency, the key assumption changes have increased the mortality rates for older age policyholders not on claim and reflective of our experience for this cohort. \u2047 Persistency changes had a favorable pre-tax impact of $152 million. \u2047 Finally, regarding future premium rate increases, as a reminder, our approach is to include rate increases that have been approved, filed but not approved, but that we plan to file as part of the current rate increase program. \u2047 Over the past year, our actual rate achievement has exceeded our prior-year expectations, contributing $200 million of favorable impacts. \u2047 In addition, we are continuing to file for"], "gold_summary": ["cna financial q3 earnings per share $0.79.  \u2047  compname
