{"article": ["We're continuing to follow social distancing procedures. \u2047 So our executives are in different locations today. \u2047 Please bear with us again if we have any delays or mixed audio quality during the call. \u2047 On the call, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our operating performance. \u2047 And now Connie will begin with her remarks. \u2047 I am very proud of the performance of our company and our employees during this COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 While all of us face uncertainties regarding the trajectory of the virus and its implications for our pace of economic recovery, what is clear is the strength and resilience of our businesses, the dedication of our employees and our commitment to supporting our customers and our economy throughout this period. \u2047 On last quarter's call, we talked about the strengths that would help our company navigate through COVID-19. \u2047 Our long history of providing essential services for most of our state; our strong liquidity across our enterprise; the stabilizing effect of decoupling and other regulatory mechanisms at our utility; and our bank's conservative approach to risk, low-risk loan portfolio, low-cost core deposit base and strong capital position. \u2047 This strong foundation, coupled with other factors that benefited earnings, enabled us to deliver solid financial results for the second quarter, $0.45 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the same period last year, while achieving important progress on our long-term goals. \u2047 I'll start with an update on the virus and economic conditions in Hawaii before turning to an update on our companies. \u2047 Then Greg will review our financial results and outlook. \u2047 We're fortunate that Hawaii continues to have the nation's lowest COVID-19 mortality rate. \u2047 While cases per capita in Hawaii have generally been lower than other states throughout the pandemic, we have seen an uptick in cases recently, which our state is working to address. \u2047 We're seeing the effects of reopening of our local economy and unprecedented federal stimulus, which is estimated to have delivered approximately $7.7 billion in funding to our state thus far. \u2047 Hawaii's unemployment rate improved to 13.9% in June after peaking at 23.8% in April. \u2047 At our utility, while sales were 11.6% below the same quarter last year, we've seen sales improve in some areas such as shopping centers and retail since opening of our local economy began. \u2047 We've also seen areas that have maintained stability throughout the COVID period such as our federal government and military presence. \u2047 Residential real estate values have remained strong and are up from last year, showing continued strength for the collateral that secures much of our bank's lending. \u2047 A key question for Hawaii's economy is when transpacific travel and tourism can resume. \u2047 Hawaii currently plans to allow travelers with a negative COVID test to forego the mandatory 14-day quarantine beginning September 1. \u2047 Recognizing Hawaii's prudent management of COVID-19, Japan announced Hawaii's addition to a list of 12 global destinations deemed safe for Japan residents to resume travel. \u2047 This will help restart tourism, although it may take some time before we see tourism near pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Of course, all of these plans are subject to the actual course of the virus and the effectiveness of mitigation. \u2047 While tourism and federal stimulus developments will have a significant impact on the pace at which our economy rebounds, our state does have the ingredients for a solid recovery. \u2047 We continue to benefit from a robust federal government presence here as host to the U.S.-Indo Pacific Command, from which the U.S. watches 52% of the world's surface and all component service commands. \u2047 We also believe the unique environment and experience we offer here will continue to make our state a very attractive place for tourism. \u2047 There is a new energy to economic diversification efforts here as well, and our companies are actively supporting those efforts. \u2047 Turning to our company. \u2047 At our utility, solid regulatory foundations have served both the company and our customers well and enabled us to be a source of strength for our community during this unprecedented time. \u2047 Our decoupled regulatory structure has provided accrued revenue stability despite reduced sales in the second quarter. \u2047 On June 30, our commission approved our request to defer COVID-related costs to be considered for potential recovery in a future proceeding. \u2047 To help customers during this time, we extended our suspension of disconnections through September one and have offered a range of payment plans to help customers manage their bills. \u2047 Working closely with customers is a key focus for us. \u2047 Ensuring our services are affordable is also a key focus now even more than ever. \u2047 Customer bills are lower now than last quarter due to lower fuel costs and a reduction in the RBA component of the bill due to higher-than-projected electricity sales in 2019. \u2047 A customer using 500-kilowatt hours of electricity in July paid 14% less for that energy than in March. \u2047 We are also working to become a highly efficient utility. \u2047 And as of June 30, we recorded $7.2 million in a regulatory liability account related to ERP benefits, amounts that are to be returned to customers as a reduction in O&M expenses included in rates. \u2047 We've also secured significantly lower and fixed priced renewable energy plus storage contracts through our recent RFPs, which will help lower and stabilize customer bills once those come online. \u2047 Last week, the PUC issued a final decision in the Hawaii Electric Light rate case. \u2047 Results were consistent with the interim decision maintaining current effective rates. \u2047 In recognition of financial challenges our customers face in this COVID period, in late May, we and the consumer advocate filed a settlement with the PUC to hold base rates flat in Hawaiian Electric's 2020 Oahu rate case. \u2047 You may recall that the PUC had commissioned a management audit as part of the rate case. \u2047 The audit report highlighted areas for improvement, including several we had identified and were working to address. \u2047 In response to the audit and as part of the settlement, we committed to ramp up to $25 million in annual savings by year-end 2022 to be delivered to customers beginning by 2023. \u2047 We have proposed to deliver those savings to customers through PBR. \u2047 An interim decision on the settlement is scheduled for October. \u2047 In addition, we are no longer planning to file a Maui Electric 2021 rate case. \u2047 To offset the lack of a base rate increase and achieve our $25 million by year-end 2022 commitment, we're developing and have begun implementing plans to reduce costs, including through overtime reductions, better scheduling and coordination, managed reductions of our workforce and reducing lower priority work. \u2047 And in the second quarter, we already began to see some of these savings. \u2047 As we advance these important cost reductions, we, our commissions and other stakeholders continue to ensure that the renewable and regulatory transition moves forward. \u2047 There is great interest in our state in doing everything we can to make Hawaii's economic recovery a green and sustainable recovery. \u2047 Performance-based rate making, or PBR, continues on track for PUC decision this December, which we believe will lay out the core mechanisms and performance incentive mechanisms, or PIMs. A new step in the schedule has been added thereafter to enable development of tariffs to implement the new and changed mechanisms. \u2047 The commission will determine when the new changes will be effective in 2021. \u2047 We continue to aggressively advance efforts to help move our state toward 100% renewable energy and carbon neutrality. \u2047 These efforts will also help provide jobs and construction activity to help our state recover from the impacts of COVID-19. \u2047 This includes pursuing new sources of renewable energy through Hawaii's largest renewable procurements. \u2047 In May, we announced the final selection of projects for our Stage two renewable energy RFP. \u2047 We're excited to have 14 projects, all solar plus storage or storage only, from the original 16 selected moving forward through the contract negotiation and community engagement phase. \u2047 If all are completed, they could add about 450 megawatts of solar and about three gigawatt hours of storage to our system. \u2047 Two of the projects are company self-build storage projects on Maui and Hawaii Island. \u2047 Stage one RFP projects also continue to advance. \u2047 While some developers provided force majeure notices as a preventive measure given the possibility of COVID-19 interruptions, so far, all stage one projects are still moving forward. \u2047 Last month, the commission approved our application to rebuild the Puna Geothermal Venture, or PGV, transmission line. \u2047 This will allow us to bring PGV back on to our system under the existing PPA, while awaiting approval of our amended PPA. \u2047 With land at a premium in Hawaii, we'll need to use both open land and as many rooftops as are available to reach our renewable energy goals. \u2047 We're gathering information on parcels as small as one acre and rooftops of at least 3,200 square feet for future grid-scale solar and wind projects and community solar projects. \u2047 We also continue working to help reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector. \u2047 To help accelerate this transition, we filed a pilot project for eBUS make-ready infrastructure. \u2047 And just this week, Hawaiian Electric announced its commitment to convert its entire fleet of light-duty vehicles across the islands, nearly 400 sedans, SUVs, small vans and light trucks to be electric by 2035, leading the state of Hawaii in electric vehicle fleets. \u2047 Turning to our bank. \u2047 In the second quarter, we stayed focused on doing the right things during this difficult time, ensuring employee and customer safety and well-being, supporting our customers, managing risk and controlling costs. \u2047 We've ramped up sanitation efforts and the use of PPE at all of our locations and workspaces, and we've rolled out a new contactless card for all of our debit cardholders to keep them safe. \u2047 We've been able to help our customers manage economic uncertainty, offering fee suspensions and loan deferral and forbearance options, and providing Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP loans. \u2047 Our team worked aggressively to secure and deploy PPP funding, delivering $370 million in loans for approximately 4,100 small businesses that represent roughly 40,000 jobs in our state. \u2047 This accounted for the bulk of our loan growth in the quarter. \u2047 At the bank, we have a front-row seat to the effects of federal stimulus with federal stimulus checks, leading to significant deposit growth, 24% on an annualized basis. \u2047 This excess liquidity gives us added cushion during this COVID period, although it does pressure net interest margin. \u2047 The bank's net interest margin was also impacted by the lower interest rate environment and PPP loans. \u2047 Our core focus has been prudently managing our risk. \u2047 Our team has been working closely with commercial customers to understand their financial condition and ensure we provision at the right levels, and we're controlling costs despite additional COVID related expenses. \u2047 We're also taking advantage of new opportunities that this period presents. \u2047 As an example, we've seen rapid customer adoption of self-service options such as online banking and ATMs. This allows us to accelerate our plans for optimizing our branch footprint. \u2047 We've also started implementing our planned replacement of our ATM fleet with smart ATMs which will be the newest in Hawaii and will give customers even more capabilities outside the branches. \u2047 Now Greg will review our results for the quarter and our outlook. \u2047 Turning to our second quarter results on Slide 7. \u2047 Consolidated earnings per share were $0.45 versus $0.39 in the same quarter last year. \u2047 At the utility, timing and management of expenses and the PUC's grant of deferral treatment for COVID-19 related expenses had a positive impact. \u2047 At the bank, strong mortgage production and a gain on sale of securities helped offset tighter lending margins and higher provision. \u2047 At the holding company, while costs were well in line with plan, we did see a slight increase due to an acceleration, an increase in our charitable giving during the quarter to support our local community organizations and those impacted by COVID. \u2047 Consolidated 12-month ROE remains healthy at 9.4%. \u2047 Utility ROE increased 10 basis points versus the same time last year to 7.9%. \u2047 Bank ROE, which we look at on an annualized rather than a trailing 12-month basis, was 8% for the quarter, down from last year due to economic impacts of COVID-19. \u2047 Turning to the next slide. \u2047 Utility earnings were $42.3 million compared to $32.6 million in the same quarter last year, reflecting, in part, savings due to process improvements and targeted cost reductions. \u2047 The most significant drivers of the variance were $7 million lower operations and maintenance expenses, primarily due to fewer generating unit overhauls, less generating station maintenance work associated with overhauls, the reclassification of COVID-19-related bad debt expense from the first quarter of 2020 to a regulatory asset as a result of the PUC approval to defer these expenses and lower labor costs due to lower staffing levels and reduced over time. \u2047 The lower generation overhauls and station maintenance work represented approximately $4 million of the $7 million O&M variance and are largely timing related as some of that work will be performed later this year or next year. \u2047 Earnings also reflected a $5 million revenue increase from $4 million higher RAM revenues and $1 million for recovery of West Loch project and grid modernization projects under the MPIR mechanism. \u2047 $1 million higher net income due to an unfavorable adjustment in 2019 related to reliability performance incentives and $1 million lower interest expense due to debt refinancings at lower rates. \u2047 These items were slightly offset by the following after tax items: $1 million lower allowance for funds used during construction as we were as there were fewer long-duration projects in construction work in progress; $1 million higher cost savings from ERP system implementation to be returned to customers; and $1 million higher depreciation due to increasing investments to integrate more renewable energy, improve customer reliability and strengthen system efficiency. \u2047 Turning to the drivers of the utility's financial performance for the remainder of the year, the Public Utility Commission issued its final decision for our Hawaii Island Utility, confirming Hawaii Electric's 9.5% allowed ROE and 58% equity capitalization with no change to base rates. \u2047 Separately, if the PUC approves our settlement with the consumer advocate in the Hawaiian Electric rate case for Oahu, we should see a similar outcome, no increase in base rates with 9.5% allowed ROE and 58% equity capitalization. \u2047 The utility's multiyear strategy for greater operational efficiency and cost reductions should help offset the lack of base rate increases. \u2047 The PUC order approving deferral of COVID-related expenses covers expenses incurred from March 17 to year-end. \u2047 In the second quarter, we reclassified a pre-tax amount of"], "gold_summary": ["hawaiian electric industries q2 earnings per share $0.45.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.45."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share $0.45.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.45.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.45."]}
