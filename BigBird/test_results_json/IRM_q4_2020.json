{"article": ["We have provided the user-controlled slides on our Investor Relations website. \u2047 We are joined here today by Bill Meaney, president and CEO; and Barry Hytinen, our EVP and CFO. \u2047 Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, how we continue to execute on Project Summit and the resulting transformation across the organization, how we have accelerated momentum in our data center business, and how we are increasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion and other sustainability initiatives. \u2047 In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. \u2047 We have included the reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information. \u2047 With that, Bill, would you please begin? \u2047 Let me start by saying I hope you and your families are safe and well. \u2047 As we close out a year, which has been marked by a first quarter, delivering near record growth growth to a remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're also going. \u2047 Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the rollout of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macroeconomic landscape. \u2047 However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate now, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. \u2047 I couldn't be more proud of my fellow mountaineers around the world in terms of the way we responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 In a phrase, we managed the crisis, the crisis didn't manage us. \u2047 We continue to serve our customers where throughout the depths of the crisis, more than 96% of our facilities remained open. \u2047 We maintained our focus on Project Summit, where we have increased our targeted sustained annual cost savings from $200 million to $375 million, and have already achieved over $200 million on an annual run rate by the end of 2020. \u2047 We accelerated our growth in data center with 58.5 megawatts of new leases announced in 2020 versus 16.9 megawatts in 2019. \u2047 We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces. \u2047 These services led to growth in some of our digital solutions year on year of 8%, excluding FX. \u2047 And we continue to see good returns from our global strategic accounts organization and maintained our focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit to be one more in-tune with accelerating our revenue growth through new services and solutions. \u2047 This continued focus on expanding our service offerings to our customer base of 225,000 customers and organizations, in spite of COVID, has allowed us to guide to organic revenue growth of 2% to 6% in 2021, the highest level of our growth in the past decade. \u2047 This significant investment in innovation and new product development is supported by our purpose to be our customers' most trusted partner for protecting and unlocking the value of what matters most to them in innovative and socially responsible ways. \u2047 Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center. \u2047 In other words, being both the lock and this is key to many of our customers' physical and digital data assets. \u2047 The strategy is underpinned by our high-performance, customer-obsessed culture and our strong customer connection with not only 225,000 customers, but over 950 of the world's largest 1,000 companies. \u2047 It is not simply investment in products that has given us accelerated revenue growth but a deliberate focus on shifting our culture as part of Project Summit. \u2047 This shift in culture is also marked by a singular focus on our customers as our north star; an acceleration in our commitments around diversity and inclusion, not just because it is just, but also because it is a key to our strategic success in being a more creative and dynamic organization, which can deliver more value in tune with our customer needs; and an increase in our commitments to carbon neutrality. \u2047 2020 stars continue to secure renewable energy to meet the power needs of 100% of our data centers, even with the rapid increase in bookings in new facilities operating. \u2047 Some examples of our laser focus on how we have responded to our customers' needs in more creative ways, including processing these unemployment benefits to get them into the hands of people in need during the crisis and setting up 12 digital mail rooms around the globe for customers who didn't know how they were going to stay connected with their remote workforce. \u2047 In a phrase, we helped our customers when they needed it most. \u2047 What that all means to me is that we came out of 2020 stronger than ever, a company with a new sense of momentum that will also fuel both our top and bottom line growth. \u2047 For the next few minutes, allow me to illustrate for you what I mean by momentum. \u2047 If resilience was the word for 2020, growth is the word for 2021. \u2047 We're already seeing evidence of this growth in data centers, for example, and then expect this to continue. \u2047 As we have discussed before, we are also seeing good growth in digital solutions as well as physical storage, both from the continued durability of our records management business, together with an expanding consumer business and believe this growth should continue. \u2047 This change in revenue growth trajectory is a direct result of the investments we have made in new product areas, coupled with changes we have made in our commercial engine. \u2047 One of the fundamental changes we have made in our commercial approach is that we have invested in creating more time for our salespeople to engage differently with our strategic customers. \u2047 This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new data center customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as driving much more value from data both physically and digitally. \u2047 As a result, you can see, both from our performance last year as well as the guidance we have provided today for 2021, our company is more and more seen by our customers as a real partner who, yes, protects and manages all their physical and digital assets, but also gives our customers the key to integrating their information, unlocking its value as well as accelerating their own digital transformation journey. \u2047 For 70 years, we've offered protection for the assets our customers value most. \u2047 We now more and more catalog, index, govern and manage complete information across physical and digital domains, securely storing what customers need, disposing of what they down and helping them unearth the insights that drive business transformation. \u2047 Let's now explore some exciting growth opportunities ahead of us. \u2047 These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform, or CSP, think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and to secure offline storage for a highly secure air gap data storage for cost-effective protection against ransom attacks. \u2047 Let's go into a little bit more detail about a couple of these areas. \u2047 In data center, we have built a strong global platform with 15 operating facilities across three continents since 2017. \u2047 And we just announced an agreement, which once closed, will mark our entry into the very fast-growing Indian market through some of our investment in the Web Werks. \u2047 The total addressable market for our data centers globally is $20 billion, and is growing at over 10% for co-location or retail customers in over 40% for our hyperscale segment. \u2047 If you look at fine art storage and entertainment services, it's roughly a $2 billion market for both together. \u2047 And just two months ago, the L.A. Times wrote an article about our entertainment services business. \u2047 They called us the Fort Knox of Hollywood. \u2047 The article highlighted how we are driving a different level of growth in that business through not just storage, but how we facilitate more opportunities for the studios and artists in distributing their assets to viewers and listeners. \u2047 In consumer, we've grown the business in one year from about 2 million cubic feet of storage to more than 7 million cubic feet of storage, so 3x as big in just 12 months. \u2047 The total addressable market for consumer storage is more than $35 billion, and it is growing at about 5% to 6% per year. \u2047 I'd note that our segment focus is on valet storage, where our logistics expertise gives us strong competitive advantage as well as being a nice submarket, which represents a significant opportunity for future growth. \u2047 Our SITAD business has an addressable market of $10 billion, and we have seen strong growth in this business over the course of 2020. \u2047 More importantly, we have found that our strong heritage around data security and chain of custody is proving a differentiator as we recently took on the global responsibility for SITAD on behalf of two large financial institutions. \u2047 So hopefully, this helps you appreciate now why we are so excited about the growth opportunities as we look to 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Taken together, the seven areas I highlighted earlier represent a significant market opportunity for us. \u2047 Let me put some context around that. \u2047 If you look back to 2015, the total addressable market we competed in was $10 billion. \u2047 And on average, those markets had low growth rates. \u2047 Over the last five years, as we've listened to customers, built expertise and developed new products and solutions, the addressable market that we now compete in is over $80 billion, yes, $80 billion. \u2047 Additionally, those products and services that we've developed expertise in are growing at a 13% organic growth rate. \u2047 So not only has the addressable market for our expanded service has grown by over eight times, but these new areas have double-digit industry growth rates, which helps facilitate our entry. \u2047 Let me now shift gears and briefly review our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2020. \u2047 At a high level, we couldn't have been more pleased with the way our mountaineers navigated the challenging environment in 2020 brought on by COVID-19. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, we were laser-focused on execution and then controlling those factors that we could, leading to outperformance against our own internal expectations through the last 3 quarters of 2020. \u2047 This resulted in continued strength in total storage rental revenue, which grew nearly 4% on a constant currency basis and 2.4% organically. \u2047 While service revenue declines continued to offset the solid storage growth, we grew adjusted EBITDA 1.3% when adjusting for some currency, and our margin expanded 110 basis points in 2020. \u2047 This, all in spite of total revenue being down $115 million due to service activity declines. \u2047 Our success is a reflection of our mountaineers' dedication, and most importantly, I have been inspired by the way our teams looked after both the physical and the mental health of each other as they also navigated the threats from COVID, both at work and at home. \u2047 Turning now to our physical storage business. \u2047 Total global organic volume was essentially flat compared to the third quarter. \u2047 Contributing to this was a 1.9 million cubic foot increase in consumer and adjacent businesses, offset by a similar decrease in records and information management volume. \u2047 For the full year, total global organic volume was also flat, which is a good outcome considering the environment in which we were operating. \u2047 This year, we expect total global organic volume to be flat to slightly up. \u2047 Looking more specifically at RIM organic volume, this was down 1.9 million cubic feet sequentially. \u2047 For the full year, organic volume declined 1.1%. \u2047 In our Global Digital Solutions business in 2020, and we were actually able to grow service revenue 8% year over year, excluding FX. \u2047 Despite the pandemic, our team grew revenue. \u2047 This goes back to the different mindset I mentioned earlier. \u2047 We see a further acceleration in our digital solutions business going into 2021 and expect to exceed about $300 million in revenue for the year. \u2047 Turning now to our Global Data Center segment. \u2047 The team had a phenomenal year, blowing its leasing targets out of the water quarter after quarter. \u2047 For the full year, we leased more than 58 megawatts remember, our target coming into 2020 was 15 to 20 megawatts. \u2047 I want to underscore that, that success was not just the result of leasing to hyperscalers. \u2047 We had very good commercial momentum in our core enterprise retail location business, which represented 12 megawatts of the 58 megawatts or close to 40% of our bookings, excluding Frankfurt. \u2047 We attracted 73 new logos to our platform during 2020, adding to our broad and diverse base of more than 1,300 data center customers. \u2047 This should enable us to strengthen our network ecosystem and increase the stickiness of our deployments. \u2047 We also had this busy year in terms of development with more than 10 megawatts commissioned across multiple data centers and geographies increasing our leasable megawatts to 130. \u2047 Our team is actively adding to our development pipeline to ensure we have the right capacity in the right markets to meet robust customer demand, and we are excited for the opportunities we see ahead of us in 2021, where we expect to end the year with over 170 leasable megawatts. \u2047 One of those opportunities is further expanding our data center footprint into our new fast-growing markets. \u2047 The data center market in India is projected to grow rapidly in the coming years, and India is the second largest telecommunications market in the world. \u2047 We are very excited to be an early mover into an emerging market where the demand is high and the supply is low. \u2047 Turning to Project Summit, we generated adjusted EBITDA benefits of $165 million in 2020, consistent with our most recent expectations and significantly ahead of our initial estimates of $80 million, reflecting strong execution in swift and decisive actions activity and I think -- that actions are early initiatives. \u2047 This gives us an exit rate of annual savings of over $200 million heading into 2021. \u2047 As you will hear from Barry in more detail, we are fully on track to recognize the estimated $375 million of adjusted EBITDA benefiting this year, and we are expecting as this -- and we are excited for the tangible benefits we will experience this year as we continue to enhance our technology and processes. \u2047 Before I wrap up, I'd like to provide a little more detail about our continued commitment to cut our carbon emissions I referenced earlier. \u2047 We were one of the first 100 or so corporations worldwide to have an ambitious carbon reduction goal approved by the science-based targets initiative as being aligned with the Paris Climate"], "gold_summary": ["q4 revenue fell 1.8 percent to $1.06 billion.  \u2047  qtrly affo per share $0.66.  \u2047  continues to expect project summit to generate $375
