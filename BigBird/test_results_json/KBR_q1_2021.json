{"article": ["Joining us today are Stuart Bradie, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Sopp, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Stuart and Mark will provide highlights from the quarter and then open the call for your question. \u2047 These risks are discussed in our most recent Form 10-K available on our website. \u2047 I will start on slide four. \u2047 Now you should all be very familiar with those Zero Harm sustainability program by now under 10 pillars that fit within it across the ESG spectrum. \u2047 At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted that being a good corporate citizen was the floor and not the ceiling at KBR, and I wanted to prove on that side a little bit more today. \u2047 The symbiotic relationship between shareholder value and KBR helping our clients achieve their sustainability goals is an absolutely key differentiator for KBR. \u2047 And we wanted to build on that just a little on to slide five. \u2047 KBR has a suite of recycling technologies that enable secular processing and the broader secular economy. \u2047 At the Investor Day, Dow introduced Mura'srevolutionaryHydroPRS technology that closes the loop on the secular plastics economy. \u2047 This is very exciting on its own right and this excitement I think was compounded with the recent announcement that Dow is also investing unimportantly committing to off-take. \u2047 This obviously is a huge endorsement on the sustainability aspects and of course, a huge endorsement on the technology itself and is an important step forward. \u2047 But at KBR, we have many recycling technologies as outlined on the slide. \u2047 All are proprietary, differentiated, disruptive and market-leading. \u2047 And we could spend the entire call and I don't plan to do that talking about these technologies. \u2047 But today I'll highlight just one example to give you a flavor and that's on sustainable fibers. \u2047 Our global retailer from Scandinavia came to a few years ago to help them solve a big problem. \u2047 How to recover valuable chemicals and water from what would have been a waste stream at the end of their process to produce manmade fibers. \u2047 Our sustainable technology team applied our proven of operation on crystallization technology to essentially recover and purify critical ingredients and water such that they can be reintroduced right at the front of the process. \u2047 Closing the loop on the secular processing. \u2047 And this solution has many benefits as I'm sure you can appreciate, it reduces processing cost, it saves finite elemental resources and water, and it eliminates a wasting. \u2047 So overall it's great value for the client. \u2047 Obviously for KBR and our shareholders and of course the planet. \u2047 So like you've heard me say before, advancing our clients' ESG objectives, its core to KBR strategy and this example is just one of the many that demonstrates that tenant. \u2047 So on to slide and some key highlights from the quarter. \u2047 The key takeaway here is overall revenue, EBITDA margin, adjusted earnings per share and cash were all in line with full-year guidance, and I'd say a little bit above our expectations for Q1. \u2047 You'll recall that we stated that first half versus second half would be circa 40-60 split at the earnings per share level. \u2047 That has now shifted to the circa 45-55 split with a couple of things happening in Q1, that were expected to happen in Q2 and Q3. \u2047 And this was especially the case in Sustainable Tech and Mark will give you some more details on this later. \u2047 Margins were bang on at the Group level with some discrete items some puts and takes that Mark will cover later within the segments. \u2047 But to be clear, full-year margin guidance at the Group and within the individual segments is not changing and I'll say that again the Q1 puts and takes do not change full-year margin guidance. \u2047 Free cash conversion at over 100% was again strong and importantly the team brought and over $1.6 billion in backlog and options during the quarter in high-end technical top market areas increasing our total backlog with options to $90.3 billion more on some of these wins in a moment, but super exciting. \u2047 So, Q1 was a relatively clean quarter at the group level. \u2047 As the overall business continued its momentum from 2020 and 2021 guidance remains unchanged. \u2047 So, on to slide seven. \u2047 The market outlook in GS was dominated by the release of the President's proposed 2022 budgets. \u2047 The DoD budget was aligned with what we presented at Investor Day. \u2047 So no surprises there. \u2047 And KBR was very well positioned opposite national security and DoD strategic priorities. \u2047 A few of the areas are highlighted on the slide. \u2047 Artificial intelligence and machine learning, cyber, trusted microelectronics and directed energy. \u2047 And you can see on the right hand side, prove the site. \u2047 We're especially excited this quarter by the trusted microelectronics win to conduct advanced R&D, prototyping, laboratory testing and supply chain verification on critical Microchip's and components. \u2047 This is really important work done by top tier scientists and PhDs to ensure major military systems and platforms operate as intended and have not been compromised. \u2047 We also won new work with the U.S. Space Force Rapid Capabilities Office or RCO to support the development and acquisition of new space capabilities and the modernization of the military space infrastructure. \u2047 Again this is highly advanced work centered around technical R&D and critical military space domain. \u2047 Shifting a little bit over to the civil space side. \u2047 The NASA budget request was also released and shows a marked increase and continue to support for the return to main and beyond. \u2047 And of course increased funding across a range of Fed spend activities focused, as you would expect initially on COVID, climate change an area of differentiation as you know for KBR and social justice. \u2047 The proposed infrastructure plan was also released and was very R&D heavy, very technology-driven on climate focused lining up well with KBR's R&D capability and technology portfolio. \u2047 This quarter we saw some great wins also in the international government business. \u2047 As you can see on the right hand side of the slide both in the U.K. and in Australia. \u2047 And there was also good news from a budget perspective in the U.K. and this follows on from Australia increasing its defense budget last year. \u2047 As an aside, and his team in Australia are off to another good start, posting top organic growth rates again at over 30% year-on-year this quarter. \u2047 And this is a nice example of a great team doing things that matter within a healthy budget environment. \u2047 One aspect not on the slide, but worth mentioning was the announcement on troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. \u2047 As most of you are aware, we took a very conservative view in this area, which has proven to be prudent. \u2047 So in short, no red flags coming from recent announcements, no red flags from the budget priorities, in fact very much aligned to what we presented in Investor Day, so very much aligned with our expectations. \u2047 The market and our strategic positioning reaffirm our ongoing momentum. \u2047 Now on to slide eight on sustainable technology. \u2047 The market and key strategic themes shown on the slide continue to gather momentum. \u2047 It's a hot market. \u2047 The recent announcement from the Biden administration are fully aligned with these themes as we discussed at Investor Day. \u2047 Our suite of technologies remains in high demand and I'm also pleased to announce a disruptive PDH technology K-PRO that was actually launched last year has secured its first commercial scale order. \u2047 There are details on this on the right hand side of the slide, but to put it simply, this technology takes low value propane and converts it into high value propylene and it does so in a more sustainable and more cost effective manner than the competition. \u2047 It is worth noting that the book-to-bill of heritage technology was 1.5 in the quarter. \u2047 Led by important sales of exciting new disruptive technologies K-PRO, K-COT and K-SAAT. \u2047 And bookings of these technologies dominated the tech book-to-bill as clients look to meet growing demand for propylene and high value clean refining solutions with our disruptive differentiated and in our view, often superior technologies. \u2047 Now we've talked a lot about K-SAAT technology in the past and obviously I've just covered K-PRO. \u2047 But I'd be remiss if I did not touch on K-COT and the K-COT win in the quarter which was a substantial booking by the team. \u2047 Now K-COT is KBR catalytic olefins technology, it is the only and I repeat only technology of its kind in the market. \u2047 Now this technology is unique and that it produces meaningfully higher volumes of propylene versus fastest competing technologies and as you know, propylene is in very, very high demand. \u2047 Additionally K-COT is the only commercially proven continuous operating process on the market, which means the both capex and opex costs are substantially lower and the energy consumption and thus environmental impact are also greatly reduced. \u2047 So in other words, it's highly monetizable at lower investment and operating costs translating into a higher ROI for our clients and at the same time advancing their sustainability agenda altogether very compelling. \u2047 So staying on the right hand side of the slide, as you would expect the cadence of awards and our energy transition advisory business also increased and is a great early indicator of activity in that market. \u2047 But it's clearly a step change in this activity and the cadence of new opportunities and awards has actually been above our expectation. \u2047 Technology led industrial solutions also had a fantastic start to the year and the pipeline for our digital solutions that leverages our IP and our domain expertise and helps our customers reduce cost, enhance throughput, increasing efficiency while also advancing their own sustainability goals is resonating. \u2047 As Mark will show you in a moment sustainable technology has come out of the gate strong in Q1, and we remain confident in delivering our 2021 guide that they will be a business that do sucker $1 billion in revenue, likely a bit more and with EBITDA margins in the mid teens, the high-end government business is a sustainable tech kicker. \u2047 So on to slide nine on the pipeline. \u2047 In Q1, we had some really nice wins and strategic areas as we just touched on so really following through on winning the right work. \u2047 It starts on the right you will be familiar with you know the stellar recompete win rate, the balanced portfolio of opportunities over $1 billion and multiple sizable opportunities over $100 million showing both the overall scale of opportunity, but also a minimal concentration risk. \u2047 The team has done a nice job across the customer set picking over $1.6 billion in awards and options in the quarter, a pleasing result and a typically like bookings quarter. \u2047 The key message here is that the recent budget announcements we expect to see our pipeline remain robust. \u2047 And the momentum we have is expected to continue. \u2047 Now I'll remind you we have a low recompete year in 2021 and in 2022 and you can probably see why we're so bullish on the outlook. \u2047 Now, when we announced guidance in late February, we stated that we had already secured over 70% seven zero percent of the work required to deliver the 2021 plan. \u2047 In Q1, we had excellent execution, especially in sustainable technology and this combined with Q1 bookings has driven the level of secured revenue closer to 80% eight zero percent. \u2047 So in short the markets and budgets remain very favorable. \u2047 We continue to deliver while also and on that I'd just like to have big shout to our people who do an incredible job and do things that really matter. \u2047 We are winning work and the differentiated areas we set out to do. \u2047 Our ESG commitment and direct linked to shareholder value is super exciting and compelling and Q1 was a great start to what is shaping up to be a great 2021 and beyond. \u2047 I now will hand over to Mark, who will give you some more color on the segments. \u2047 I will pick up on Slide 11. \u2047 So as you just heard, Q1 performance was generally in line with our 2021 guidance expectations and also our long range targets that we presented to you last month in our Investor Day. \u2047 Revenues of $1.5 billion and $135 million of adjusted EBITDA are right in line with our fiscal 2021 guide of $6 billion top-line and 9% EBITDA margin. \u2047 Cash was once again very strong out of the gate with free cash flow conversion coming in at 109% for the quarter. \u2047 Stuart also said it was particularly encouraging is the quality of the work that's coming in, in new orders. \u2047 We are winning high technology content defense, research and development and modernization contracts in line with our upmarket strategy. \u2047 Trusted microelectronics, rapid research and development and prototyping and others that Stuart cited earlier and also in our release are really good examples. \u2047 These programs are high priority high barrier to entry and in some cases leverageable to greater opportunities in the future. \u2047 The same is true in sustainable tech a stellar quarter in bookings for proprietary process technologies, including strong bookings across our new disruptive sustainability focus technologies like you heard from Stuart K-COT, K-PRO and K-SAAT and measured progress on energy transition advisory and smart operations and maintenance awards. \u2047 As I'll cover later, we did have some acceleration of profit in the first quarter, which were modestly relate our first half to second half earnings more toward the 45%, 55% mix versus our initial guide of 40%, 60%, but the bottom line here is, we are on track on all measures and thus reaffirming our guidance for the year. \u2047 On to Slide 12. \u2047 First as planned, we have collapsed into two segments Government Solutions, GS and Sustainable Technology Solutions STS. \u2047 Highlights on the GS side include 19% top-line growth, 5% of which was organic. \u2047 We absorbed a headwind from reduced of Middle East activity compared to last year with new growth areas, predominantly in sustaining and doing programs. \u2047 We have underscored to reduce dependency on the Middle East contingency work and the 15% growth in Readiness & Sustainment highlights the enormous success of our team in driving growth from new more recurring sources that will carry forward. \u2047 15% net organic growth in light of the reduced of Middle East activity is one of the top success stories this quarter and hats off to Ella Studer and her team for delivering not only excellent service in the Middle East through all the transitions going on and through a global pandemic, but also at the same time amazingly capturing and realizing tremendous growth and baseline recurring programs elsewhere in the world truly remarkable. \u2047 Growth came from sustaining O&M funded areas such as the important work our team does to plan, schedule and support training rotations at the National Training Center. \u2047 We were pleased with a really nice new award that the team"],
