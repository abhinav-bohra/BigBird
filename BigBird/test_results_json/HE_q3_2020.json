{"article": ["We hope you're safe and well. \u2047 I have been deeply impressed by the dedication of our employees and the resilience of our customers and communities as we all adapt to the ongoing challenges of COVID-19. \u2047 Our core strengths continue to serve us well in these unprecedented times. \u2047 That includes our long history of providing essential services for the State of Hawaii, strong liquidity, stabilizing utility regulatory mechanisms, our Bank's conservative approach to risk, its low risk loan portfolio and strong capital position. \u2047 In the third quarter, our financial stability enabled us to continue helping our customers, our economy and our communities and again to deliver solid financial results. \u2047 Net income of $65 million and earnings per share of $0.59 compared to $63.4 million and earnings per share of $0.58 in the same quarter last year. \u2047 I'll start with an update on the virus and economic conditions in Hawaii before turning update on our companies. \u2047 Then, Greg will review our financial results and outlook. \u2047 Well, there is still uncertainty regarding the course of the virus and the timing of economic recovery, we've seen some positive signs. \u2047 First, daily new COVID cases are down significantly from the surge we saw this summer. \u2047 The seven-day average of new cases is down to 92 with about a 2% positivity rate after a second stay-at-home order on Oahu starting in late August. \u2047 Oahu's local economy largely reopened in late September, under a tiered framework and since then we've been able to move to the second tier allowing more business activity. \u2047 On October 15, Hawaii's tourism sector reopened with a program allowing domestic travelers with a negative COVID test to bypass the 14-day quarantine. \u2047 Since then, we've seen an average of 5,600 arrivals per day, up from the roughly 2,000 a day that we saw before the 15th. \u2047 Starting today, this program also includes travelers from Japan and Hawaii is working to extend it to other countries. \u2047 While the tourism reopening is encouraging, the timing of a sustained reopening depends on how the virus plays out. \u2047 The federal government and military, our second largest economic driver, have maintained stability throughout the COVID period. \u2047 Residential real estate values have also remained strong. \u2047 Year-to-date September, Oahu's single family home prices were up 3.3% and compared to the month of September last year, Oahu's single family home prices were up more than 13% driven by low inventory and low interest rates. \u2047 The latest forecast from the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization or UHERO whose outlooks have informed our own estimates, projects Hawaii's economic recovery starting in 2021 and accelerating into 2022. \u2047 Turning to our companies. \u2047 Keeping customer rates down has been a central focus for our utility. \u2047 That began before the onset of COVID and remains a core priority. \u2047 Fortunately, customers have seen some bill relief this year. \u2047 Lower fuel costs and a lower revenue balancing account component from higher-than-projected electricity sales last year meant that an Oahu residential customer using 500-kilowatt hours of electricity in October paid 13% less than in March. \u2047 The commission has extended the suspension of disconnections for non-payment through year-end. \u2047 We continue working with customers on repayment options and connecting them with services to help them through this time including with utility bills. \u2047 Last month, the commission approved our settlement with the consumer advocate to not increase base rates in our Oahu rate case. \u2047 In improving the settlement, the Commission maintained Hawaiian Electric's current allowed return on equity of 9.5% and 58% equity capitalization, lifted the 90% cap on Schofield Generating Station project cost recovery, ended the 2017 rate case customer benefit adjustments and deemed the enterprise resource planning system benefits commitment to be flowed through to customers as part of the zero base rate increase. \u2047 To help offset the lack of a base rate increase and deliver on our commitment to ramp up to $25 million in customer savings by year-end 2022, our utility is executing on its multi-year efficiency improvement program, which began earlier this year. \u2047 While we pursue cost efficiencies, we are also pressing forward aggressively on our clean energy goals. \u2047 We are on track to exceed the 2020 RPS milestone of 30% for the year. \u2047 Since the RPS calculation divides renewable energy by sales, lower sales due to COVID temporarily pushed our RPS above 35% as of the second quarter. \u2047 With electricity sales expected to increase in the fourth quarter, we expect RPS to moderate, but still exceed 30% by year-end. \u2047 In the next few years, we anticipate strong RPS growth from our major renewable energy and storage procurements. \u2047 In the third quarter, we filed eight purchase power agreements for renewable energy and storage projects and to self-build storage applications as part of our Stage 2 procurement. \u2047 Two of the projects selected in that procurement are still under negotiation. \u2047 Last month the PUC approved the 8th final PPA from our Stage 1 procurement for a solar-plus-storage project on Maui. \u2047 If all Stage 1 projects and the filed Stage 2 projects come online in anticipated timeframes, they would add nearly 600 megawatts of renewable energy and 3 gigawatt hours of storage to our system between now and the end of 2023. \u2047 This will help[indecipherable] Hawaii in 2022 with the expiration of one of our Oahu IPP contracts. \u2047 The Stage 2 projects together with our recently proposed Kahului synchronous condenser project will also help us retire one of our Maui fossil plants by 2024. \u2047 We are also preparing an RFP for up to 235 megawatts of community-based renewable energy. \u2047 Given the scale of our system, these procurements are significant. \u2047 If you add up what I've just talked about, you get over 800 megawatts, that's on a system with a total peak load of just 1,200 megawatts on Oahu and 200 megawatt each on Hawaii Island and Maui County. \u2047 While timing for projects to come online can be affected by many factors, there is no question we are moving forward aggressively. \u2047 As you know, we, the commission and many stakeholders, have been working hard to align the regulatory framework with customer interest and Hawaii's renewable energy goals through the performance-based regulation or PBR docket. \u2047 The commission has kept the docket moving through COVID and appears on track for a December decision. \u2047 The guiding principles is set early on in PBR including maintaining financial integrity of the utility and the collaborative stakeholder based approach, the commission established has been consistent throughout the process. \u2047 We've generally summarized areas of consensus and divergence on Slide 30 of our deck. \u2047 The Commission's decision and order will confirm the way forward. \u2047 The Commission has been progressing other dockets too, and just last week approved a 50-year contract for Hawaiian Electric to own, operate and maintain the electric system serving the Army's 12 installations on Oahu. \u2047 Turning to our banks. \u2047 American Savings Bank continues its solid execution of the dynamic COVID environment. \u2047 Areas are returning to normal operations. \u2047 We've reopened six branches we had temporarily closed. \u2047 While low interest rates continue to compress net interest margin in the third quarter, we were able to replace much of the prior quarter's gains on sales securities through core activities, including strong mortgage banking income and resumption of certain payments. \u2047 We remain focused on sound risk management, with the timing of a sustained tourism reopening uncertain, ASB's third quarter results again reflect elevated provision. \u2047 We think we are well-provisioned and continue proactively working with customers to understand how their financial health and outlook are affected by COVID. \u2047 Cost efficiency is and will continue to be our main focus particularly in the current low interest rate environment. \u2047 In addition to reducing COVID costs, we also closed five branches with two more scheduled in December. \u2047 Most of these have been temporarily closed earlier in the pandemic. \u2047 We're continuing to roll out our new smart ATMs providing more customer options and convenience. \u2047 We've been impressed by how customers have conserved to manage their resources during this time. \u2047 The majority of customers who sought initial loan deferrals are returning to repayment while some customers and sectors are more impacted, overall we are seeing low delinquency rates and continued strong deposit growth. \u2047 For customers who received PPP loans, we're now working on forgiveness and have started submitting loans to the SBA for that process. \u2047 We've continued to see robust adoption of our online and mobile banking services and high customer satisfaction with our digital offerings. \u2047 And now Greg will review our results for the quarter and our outlook. \u2047 Turning to our third quarter results. \u2047 Consolidated earnings per share were $0.59 versus $0.58 in the same quarter last year. \u2047 At the utility, timing and management of O&M expenses had a positive impact. \u2047 At the bank, tighter lending margins and COVID-driven provisioning continued to affect results while non-interest income from core activities improved compared to the linked quarter. \u2047 While holding company loss is well in line with plan, we saw a modest increase due to lower income at Pacific Current and higher interest expense from higher short-term borrowing. \u2047 Consolidated trailing 12 month ROE remains healthy at 9.4%. \u2047 Utility ROE increased 80 basis points versus the same time last year to 8.4%. \u2047 Bank ROE, which we look at on an annualized rather than a trailing 12-month basis was 6.8% for the quarter down from last year due to the economic impacts of COVID and a low interest rate environment. \u2047 Turning to the next slide. \u2047 Utility earnings were $60.1 million compared to $46.8 million in the same quarter last year. \u2047 The most significant variance drivers were $10 million lower O&M expenses, primarily due to fewer generating unit overhauls, lower labor cost due to lower staffing levels and reduced over time and elevated vegetation management work in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 The lower overhauls represented about $5 million of the $10 million O&M variance. \u2047 Of the $5 million, $2 million was due to an elevated number of overhauls in the third quarter of 2019, and the remaining $3 million was timing as some overhaul work will be performed later this year or in 2021. \u2047 We also had a $5 million revenue increase from higher rate adjustment mechanism revenues and a $1 million increase in major project interim recovery revenues for the West Loch PV and Grid Modernization projects. \u2047 These items were partially offset by the following after-tax items. \u2047 $1 million lower AFUDC as there were fewer long duration projects in construction work in progress. \u2047 $1 million higher savings from enterprise resource planning system implementation, which are to be returned to customers and $1 million higher depreciation due to increasing investments to integrate renewable energy and improve customer reliability and system efficiency. \u2047 Looking at the drivers of the utilities' financial performance for the rest of the year. \u2047 With the Commission's final decision in Hawaii Electric rate case, our rates, cost of capital and equity capitalization are now set across all three utilities. \u2047 Recall that we received a final decision in July for no base rate increase in the Hawaii Electric Light rate case and are not filing a request a rate case for Maui Electric. \u2047 The utilities multi-year efficiency program will help offset the lack of base rate increases and achieve the Management Audit customer savings commitment. \u2047 Cost savings initiatives are well under way with additional efficiency opportunities to be identified. \u2047 COVID-related expenses from March 17 to year end are being deferred for the commission order we received in June. \u2047 We've requested an extension of that deferral through at least June 30 of next year. \u2047 We'll have to file separately for recovery at a later date. \u2047 COVID related costs have been $12.4 million to date, mostly related to bad debt expense. \u2047 The suspension of customer disconnections remains in place until year end. \u2047 Lower fuel prices have been good for our customers with a typical 500-kilowatt hour residential monthly bill on Oahu in October was down $21 since March, due to fuel price savings for customers. \u2047 With these savings, the utility may qualify for a reward under the fossil fuel cost risk sharing mechanism. \u2047 On Slide 11, based on year-to-date information, we are forecasting $340 million to $350 million of capex in 2020, down from $360 million communicated last quarter, primarily due to unexpected delays from COVID-19 and completion of some of our work at lower cost. \u2047 Specifically COVID-19 delayed our smart meter deployment, completion of a generating unit overhaul on Maui and impacted transmission structural replacement work when a helicopter contractor went out of business due to COVID-19. \u2047 Fortunately, we were able to bring some of that work in-house and completed at lower cost. \u2047 We also saw some other delays related to permitting. \u2047 We are maintaining our longer-term capex and rate base guidance in the 2021 to 2022 period. \u2047 We still expect capex to average approximately $400 million per year or about 2 times depreciation. \u2047 While strategically important, we don't expect the recently approved Army Privatization contract to have a material impact on annual earnings, which will depend on a number of factors including the amount in timing of capital upgrades and capital replacements. \u2047 We continue to expect the utility to self-fund its forecasted capex through 2020 via retained earnings and access to the debt capital markets. \u2047 Turning to the bank on Slide 12. \u2047 American's net income was $12.2 million in the quarter compared to $14 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 Although yield on earning assets continued to be impacted by the low interest rate environment, we had improvements in a number of areas including record mortgage banking income, a record low cost of funds supporting net interest margin, increased fee income as we resumed certain fees suspended to help customers during the initial impact of COVID and lower non-interest expense. \u2047 We continue to see elevated provisioning this year given the ongoing COVID-19 related economic uncertainty, provision was down slightly versus the last quarter, which included amounts for unfunded commitments. \u2047 Improved non-interest income from core activities and expense controls were key drivers of bank net income during the quarter. \u2047 As you may recall, we had a large one-time impact in the second quarter from $9.3 million in gains on sale of securities on a pre-tax basis. \u2047 We were able to replace much of that amount through a combination of record mortgage projection generating mortgage banking income of $7.7 million versus $6.3 million last quarter and resumption of previously suspended fees driving $9.6 million in fee revenue compared to $7.2 million last quarter. \u2047 Expense controls were also"], "gold_summary": ["hawaiian electric industries q3 earnings per share $0.59.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $0.59."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3
