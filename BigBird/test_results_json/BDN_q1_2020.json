{"article": ["Although we believe estimates reflected in these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we cannot give assurance that the anticipated results will be achieved. \u2047 Well, this is no ordinary time, and first and foremost, all of us at Brandywine sincerely hope that you and yours are safe, healthy, and sheltering in places happily and as productively as possible. \u2047 The pandemic has disrupted everything and presented a new landscape for everyone and every business. \u2047 While the duration of the crisis remains unclear, we have assessed the crisis's impact on every element of our business, employee, tenant, vendor safety and security, a return to save building operations, construction schedule delays, forward leasing pipeline and renewal activity and of course, all the related financial implications. \u2047 Additional details on these and other topics are outlined in our COVID Insert, found on Pages 1 to 13 of our supplemental package. \u2047 Looking at the first quarter, we opened the year strong. \u2047 Our first quarter results were among the best we've had in recent years. \u2047 We had excellent leasing activity. \u2047 Rental rate mark-to-market was almost 16% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a cash basis. \u2047 Same-store numbers were tracking slightly ahead of our original plan. \u2047 Capital costs were at the low end of our targeted range. \u2047 Our retention rate was 76% and we posted FFO of $0.35, which was in line with consensus. \u2047 Our leasing pipeline was building nicely, including some excellent forward leasing activity on several of our development projects. \u2047 That strong start is of course in the rear view mirror and all somewhat irrelevant given the circumstances, and our entire focus is on the path forward. \u2047 And as we turn our attention to the impact of the virus, it's important to reflect on where we are and how to extrapolate the current situation to the near and intermediate-term future. \u2047 So several observations from our team before we outline our '20 strategy. \u2047 First, we have a 25-year track record of building strong employee culture and establishing lasting relationships with our tenants, vendors and communities. \u2047 Never has the time for having built those bridges been more important than today. \u2047 So, we've erred on the side of over communicating with all of our stakeholders. \u2047 Second, the paraphrase and number of behavioral scientists and economists, how people behave in a pandemic is not really a great guide to how they will act or live their lives in normal times. \u2047 As one person put it, we're living in the middle of a grand forced experiment and we really don't know how that experiment is going to play out. \u2047 So while we've stayed in close touch with our tenants, vendors, political and community leaders, the path forward and the pace we walk down that path is somewhat uncertain. \u2047 Please note that in developing our 2020 COVID revised business plan, we've pragmatically assessed forward risk, and incorporated all those assumptions into our plan. \u2047 Given the current circumstances, this plan is as accurate as we can make it. \u2047 Third, every crisis embodies elements of both danger and opportunity. \u2047 Our clear priority has been to assess every element of risk and institute plans to effectively mitigate or anticipate its effect. \u2047 We're also, however, focused forward on the opportunity set to anticipate situations where we can enhance our business plan execution, whether that be through extending lease terms, improving the pricing of our current supply chains, we're working with institutional partners to seek opportunities where market position, talent base and capital can create growth opportunities. \u2047 So in looking at the risk factors in our COVID-19 business plan, our first priority is the safety and security of all of our employees, tenants and buildings. \u2047 We are very happy to report that no Brandywine employee has contracted the virus, and consistent with applicable state and CDC guidelines, we've maintained a doors open lights on approach to all of our building operations, and maintained close communication with our tenants, vendors, and local health and municipal officials. \u2047 Secondly, we focused on the stability of our economic platform with particular attention to each of the following items. \u2047 Given that these are no ordinary times and the stay at home orders in effect, we did receive requests from tenants for rent deferrals. \u2047 Full details of those efforts are found on Page 9 of our SIP. \u2047 Bottom line, we've about 1.6% of our rents coming from retail tenants. \u2047 Normal monthly billings run about $500,000. \u2047 We received $150,000 in April. \u2047 29 tenants or 45% of leases have been or in the process of documenting rent deferrals. \u2047 About 2.1% of our rents come from co-working and conferencing tenants. \u2047 Normal monthly billings are $675,000. \u2047 During April we received $580,000. \u2047 For April, we received 95% of overall rents, 96% collection rate from our office tenants, and 100% collection rate from our Top 30 tenants. \u2047 The vast majority of rent relief requests are from our retail and co-working tenants. \u2047 At this point, there have been no rent abatements granted. \u2047 Rent deferral situations are paid back to us either in 2020 or '21 or via lease extensions. \u2047 Just a point as well. \u2047 Our leases were clear and that our tenants have a legal obligation to pay us rents. \u2047 While we certainly recognize every company wants to preserve cash, the legal obligation to pay us rent is clear. \u2047 And as we have done over our history, we'll certainly work with those companies that truly need bridge assistance. \u2047 From an insurance standpoint, it's also clear that we can't rely on our standard property policy to reimburse us for rent not paid by tenants in default of their contractual obligations. \u2047 We did, however, have the foresight to procure a $5 million of coverage sublimit for interruption by communicable diseases under our property policy, which we believe will be operative where we have force majeure majeure, such as in the case where you have hard head work stoppages due to government mandates. \u2047 Due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of these announced, we've not included any insurance proceeds in our revised business plan. \u2047 We also were impacted by some construction work stoppages. \u2047 The vast majority of our construction operations remained shut down, with the exception of Austin, which was shut down for a period of time, and some of our operations in MetDC. \u2047 In our 2020 plan, we're assuming that construction gets back to work in the next 30 days. \u2047 In fact, in Pennsylvania, our governor last night announced plans to restart the opening of our economy on May 8, and has accelerated the restart of construction, obviously compliant with safe distancing and CDC guidelines on May 1. \u2047 But the impact of this temporary work stoppage in our '20 plan is $2.3 million of GAAP NOI, 218,000[Phonetic] square feet of lower occupancy, which reduces our year-end occupancy by 1.4%. \u2047 We also spend a significant amount of time looking at our leasing pipeline, which stands right now 1.3 million square feet. \u2047 Our leasing team and executive directors have been in extensive and repeated touch with every prospect and tenant rep of our 1.3 million square foot pipeline. \u2047 To the best we can determine as of today, we believe that about 52% of that pipeline or 670,000 square feet are deals that are progressing, but clearly with the shutdown, the execution timing is uncertain, but we would anticipate within the next 90 to 120 days. \u2047 We have about 45% of the deals in our pipeline on hold due to the virus. \u2047 Of that, based upon the information we have, we think that 10% of those will likely progress to execution, about 70%, it's just simply too early to tell as a lot of our prospects are focused on their own businesses versus their office space requirements and we believe about 15% is mostly likely dead requirements because of the virus and we expect to lose the balance of about 7% to another competitor. \u2047 We also spend a great deal of time looking our capital spend. \u2047 And as Tom will walk through in more detail, we've done a thorough review of our expected spend for the balance of the year, and have reduced that spend by $50 million or about 20%. \u2047 More detail on that can be found on Page 11 of our SIP. \u2047 We did make some adjustments to spec revenue as you might expect. \u2047 And primarily due to slower projected leasing and the impact of construction work stoppages, we're reducing our spec revenue target by $5 million to $26 million. \u2047 Our redevelopment project at 1676 International Drive in Northern Virginia experienced both of these conditions totaling almost 60% of this slide or $2.9 million. \u2047 The timing of our major tenant in that project has slid until the first part of '21, and the additional lease up that we had projected for the balance of '20, we have also shifted till next year. \u2047 Overall, leasing delays totaled about $2.7 million of GAAP revenue, and the previously mentioned work stoppage of $2.3 million accounts for the balance. \u2047 From a dividend coverage and liquidity standpoint, the company is in excellent shape. \u2047 We're projecting to have between $400 million and $480 million available on our line of credit by the end of the year, that number depends on whether we refinance or pay off an $80 million mortgage securing one of our Philadelphia CBD properties. \u2047 We only have one $10 million mortgage maturing in 2021, no unsecured bond maturities until '23. \u2047 We generate $85 million of free cash flow after debt service and dividend payments, and that dividend is extremely well covered with a 54% FFO and a 70% CAD payout ratios. \u2047 And looking at our guidance, we set our new range at $1.37 to $1.45 per share. \u2047 To do a very quick reconciliation, our previous midpoint was a $1.46 per share. \u2047 We did increase and Tom will talk about during his conversation, our project reserves, which reduced that by $0.02. \u2047 We did a building sale that cost us $0.01. \u2047 Our office leasing slides are close to $0.02 a share, the construction slides will cost us $0.01. \u2047 We anticipate losing a $0.01 through our joint ventures and we anticipate losing another $0.01 through lost parking revenue, and the hotel component of our AKA project at the FMC tower. \u2047 The share buyback, which we also announced, added $0.03 back, so our new midpoint is $1.41. \u2047 So with those components addressed, we'd like to take a look at the development opportunity set quickly. \u2047 First of all, on the development front, all four of our production assets, that is Garza, Four Points, 650, and 155 King of Prussia Road are all fully approved, all work is paid for. \u2047 The pricing has been finalized and they're ready-to-go subject to leasing. \u2047 As we have noted previously, each of these projects can be completed within four quarters to six quarters and cost between $40 million to $70 million. \u2047 Pre COVID-19, we had a strong pipeline of deals that could have kicked off one or more of these projects. \u2047 As we look at the crisis now, clearly starting any development is an elective decision, and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. \u2047 And as such, you'll note in our revised business plan, where we have reduced our two projected 2020 starts down to one, which we achieved with the start of our 3000 Market Street project. \u2047 In looking at our existing development projects, at 405 Colorado, as we identified in our supplemental, we did have a disappointment post quarter close. \u2047 Our lead 70,000 square foot tenant terminated their lease pursuant to a one-time Right-to-Terminate, if we did not meet an interim milestone delivery date. \u2047 Based on the original construction schedule, we had a significant cushion built-in to meet that milestone. \u2047 The general contractor, while still being able to complete the project on time, missed that milestone date. \u2047 We will naturally have a claim against that contractor, but right now our focus is on getting the project built and leased. \u2047 So that project now stands at 18% leased with 160,000 square feet to lease, and what we know will be a very exciting addition to Austin skyline. \u2047 We had great pipeline of deals before the crisis, and we expect that pipeline to reemerge and I've been in touch with a number of those prospects. \u2047 Due to the short construction shutdown we did have in Austin, we did slide the completion date back to Q1 '21, and due to this tenant event moved the stabilization date back to Q4 '21. \u2047 On the Bulletin Building, due solely to the mandated construction work stoppage, we are moving the completion date back one quarter to Q3 '20. \u2047 Given that that building is fully leased, we did move the stabilization date up to the Q4 of '20, so that will be fully stabilized. \u2047 This is a renovation project within Schuylkill Yards. \u2047 This 64,000 square foot building is being fully converted into a life science facility. \u2047 And we're very fortunate to have recently signed a lease with a life science tenant, where they will take the entire building on a 12-year lease commencing in the third quarter of '21, and deliver a development yield of 8.5%. \u2047 So, we're really excited. \u2047 This is truly a great exclamation point to our emerging life science push in University City. \u2047 Just quick updates on Broadmoor and Schuylkill Yards. \u2047 On Broadmoor, we're advancing Block A, which is a combination of 360,000 square foot office building, and 340 apartments through final design and pricing. \u2047 At Schuylkill Yards, we continue design development process for a dedicated life science building, and anticipate that with the schedule we have in place, market conditions permitting that could start in the first-half of year. \u2047 On our Schuylkill Yards West project, which is our office residential tower, as you know from previous calls, that's fully approved, priced and ready-to-go, subject to finalizing our debt and equity structure. \u2047 Certainly, the virus had a big impact on the timing of this project start. \u2047 We continue to work with our preferred QOZ equity partner, but the crisis has certainly slowed the pace of procuring financing. \u2047 We do remain optimistic that we'll get that across the finish line, when the situation returns to some level of normalcy. \u2047 On the investment front, we sold one property during the quarter for $18 million. \u2047 We also repurchased, net after dividends savings, $55 million of our own shares. \u2047 Those shares were purchased at a 10.5%"], "gold_summary": ["sees fy 2020 ffo per share $1.37 to $1.45 .
