{"article": ["This release is available on the Company's website at dhigroupinc.com. \u2047 Lastly, during today's call, management will be referring to specific financial measures, which include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and net debt, which are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \u2047 As always, we appreciate your interest in DHI. \u2047 I want to begin by saying a few words about COVID-19 and our response to this global pandemic. \u2047 Our foremost concern at DHI is to ensure the health and safety of our DHI community. \u2047 As such when the pandemic began to unfold in mid-March, we at DHI jumped into action to aid our communities by launching COVID-19 resource centers on each of our brand sites to assist both clients and candidates alike with information relevant to their needs in these challenging times. \u2047 These sites provide information on virtual career fairs, open remote job posts, real-time hiring trends, industry insights, articles, and hiring resources. \u2047 We also launched a campaign to provide free recruitment services to U.S. hospitals to help them find technologists in fields like electronic medical records, healthcare administration and computer system processing. \u2047 Also, all of our employees have been working from home using the best possible remote communication and collaboration tools and our team members, including sales and support, marketing and product development continue to be highly effective. \u2047 In fact, our product development team actually gained efficiency working from home this quarter, delivering dozens of new product releases. \u2047 I'll dive more into these product releases later in the call, but first let me provide a quick update on the current market environment for tech jobs. \u2047 The pandemic is certainly challenging the way we all live and work. \u2047 We saw job postings drop in the early part of the quarter but come back to the trailing 12-month average levels in June and July as companies became more confident in their hiring strategies. \u2047 Many firms serving highly impacted industries have paused or reduced their hiring plans and we believe that our bookings are highly correlated to the state of geographical restrictions and reopenings, which certainly remain in flux. \u2047 It's clear that our collective future will be more online and businesses will accelerate their efforts to digitize. \u2047 These efforts will, of course, require technologists. \u2047 A recent report released by Microsoft in July predicts that the worldwide digital jobs will grow from 41 million in 2020 to 190 million in 2025. \u2047 Of the 149 million new digital jobs created, 98 million are forecast to be in software development. \u2047 With our technology skill of data model in technology focused marketplaces, we stand ready to capitalize on this trend. \u2047 Now let me provide some more detail regarding the product development efforts I mentioned earlier. \u2047 During the second quarter, our product development team continued to deliver a high pace of product innovation. \u2047 With the release of Dice recruiter profile, we took the first leap forward in Dice's transformation from a job board to a full-scale career marketplace. \u2047 Dice Recruiter Profile allows our client recruiters to enrich their brands with photos, personal information, details of our corporate culture and important news, as well as information about latest hires, upcoming events and future hiring needs, all of which create more transparency and personalize the recruiter define the role. \u2047 Candidates can now discover the recruiters that are aligned with their interests and use recruiter profile information to better engage on job postings and respond to outreach. \u2047 With the Dice Marketplace, we're creating a trusted environment where recruiters and candidates can learn much more about each other to facilitate more effective career discussions. \u2047 We also launched Dice Remote Jobs. \u2047 The pandemic has demonstrated that candidates can successfully work from home and want to do so and that more jobs are predicted to be remote-qualified in the future. \u2047 Remote job opportunities has been the top requested feature by both clients and candidates since the start of the pandemic and the views for these job postings have been significantly higher than non-remote job postings. \u2047 This is an excellent opportunity for employers to tap into pools of remote workers across the United States to increase talent pipelines and diversify their workforce and we at DHI want to be the leader in the technologist's part of this important trend. \u2047 We also launched ClearanceJobs Automated Recruiter Workflow in the quarter, which we believe is a true game-changer. \u2047 Workflow is an easy to use set of tools that allow our recruiter to automate routine tasks in their day, including talent sourcing, pipelining, engagement, marketing and rewards[Phonetic]. \u2047 When specific candidate activities occur, they trigger automated pre-planned actions and responses. \u2047 As an example, if a recruiter is looking for an Oracle database administrator in California, when a new candidate with the correct profile registers on the database, Workflow will automatically connect the recruiter with the new candidate, tag them in their pipeline, produce an email introduction and generate a text notification that all of this has been completed. \u2047 Our internal estimates indicate that this powerful set of tools can eliminate approximately 3.5 hours of administrative task time per recruiter per day. \u2047 ClearanceJobs is the only career site in the world that incorporates this capability. \u2047 ClearanceJobs continues to be DHI's test-bed for key market-leading features like this one of a kind technology. \u2047 We also launched eFinancialCareers Enhanced Candidate Profile during the quarter. \u2047 eFC candidates can now expose a richer profile, equivalent to that offered on ClearanceJobs to recruiters specializing in their respective field. \u2047 And in mid-July, we launched eFC Follow, Voice and Video. \u2047 These features complete the eFC marketplace delivering a rich set communication tools for recruiters and professionals to engage in career discussions. \u2047 Now finance and tech professionals and recruiters can connect virtually with video and voice calling as well as instant messaging all through the eFC platform. \u2047 We have many new releases planned for the remainder of the third quarter. \u2047 Dice is completing a design for its own enhanced candidate profile and messaging system with an expected launch by year-end. \u2047 We are working on delivering calendaring integration for ClearanceJobs, and for eFC we will be releasing a modern new brand identity starting with their B2B site. \u2047 We continue to transform our sales organization this quarter with the addition of a new customer success leader, a new Dice agency program leader and the relaunch of managed services as sourcing services, with a focus on delivering vetted candidates for targeted client searches. \u2047 Much like other trends in our business, we have seen a steady improvement in the demand for sourcing services since April. \u2047 Turning to sales performance by brand. \u2047 For all of our brands we were experiencing a check mark shaped recovery, not a V-shaped recovery. \u2047 Dice's current bookings are trending toward their performance pre-pandemic, although our new business teams, including the Dice Commercial Accounts team remain challenged due to the extra conservatism of potential new clients in this environment. \u2047 Despite this challenge, the commercial sales team has been heads down training and improving its core practices. \u2047 They are becoming more sophisticated in their go-to-market approach and as a result, brought in the largest new business deal in the history of our Company. \u2047 This deal with a large U.S. government agency is worth $270,000 in annual contract value. \u2047 To put this in perspective, we typically sign new business deals in the $7,000 to $10,000 range. \u2047 This success, along with the momentum we saw in signing new customers in the weeks leading up to the start of the pandemic in mid-March gives us great confidence that our focus on commercial accounts will be the cornerstone for our growth as the business environment normalizes. \u2047 Our renewals with existing Dice clients, while impacted in the quarter as a result of the pandemic, are slowly returning to expected levels, and existing clients have told us that they cannot find appropriate technologists without our platform. \u2047 It's important to note that this dip in renewal-based bookings during the quarter will manifest itself in lower revenue for the remainder of the year, as we recognize each booking as revenue monthly across the duration of the contract. \u2047 ClearanceJobs has been relatively unaffected by the pandemic as its performance is generally correlated to the U.S. DOD budget. \u2047 We are very fortunate that the 2021 Defense Authorization bills appear to be moving forward toward approval. \u2047 We continue to work hard on expanding CJ's addressable market through direct sales to U.S. government agencies and have booked $0.5 million in new contract revenue through the first half of the year. \u2047 We expect ClearanceJobs to add several new government customers as we make our way through the rest of this year. \u2047 Finally eFinancialCareers remains our most challenged brand. \u2047 From the Hong Kong protests last summer, to the uncertainty of Brexit last fall, to the current pandemic; eFC clients have faced significant challenges that have certainly affected our bookings. \u2047 The global banking community is still working out the hiring plans in light of the indeterminate effect of the pandemic on loan portfolios. \u2047 We are fortunate that eFC is generally focused on larger banking institutions and counts 50% of the global 100 banks as clients. \u2047 These institutions believe in an online banking future and continue to hire technologists even now. \u2047 There is no question, however, that the uncertainty in the banking industry has weighed down eFC's performance to date and will continue to do so at least through the remainder of the year. \u2047 As I conclude my remarks, I want to reiterate that we are successfully executing on our plan to build career marketplaces for matching tech professionals with employers. \u2047 We believe we have created a better online platform than our competitors for matching companies with the highest quality tech professionals. \u2047 And with our proven go-to-market strategy, we believe we can capitalize on the millions of new technologist jobs expected over the next five years and grow our revenue at or above the market rate of growth. \u2047 While this growth won't happen overnight and COVID-19 certainly presents uncertainty, we are confident in our business plan and the continued progress we are making toward achieving our goal. \u2047 I'll start by going through the financial results, then add a few comments about the business. \u2047 For the second quarter, we reported total revenues of $33.8 million, which was down 8% from the first quarter and down 9% year-over-year when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. \u2047 Dice revenue was $20.5 million in the second quarter, down 9% sequentially and down 12% year-over-year. \u2047 We ended the second quarter with 5,450 Dice recruitment package customers, which is down 7% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. \u2047 During the quarter, we did not see any notable changes to customers' leaving the platform relative to other quarters. \u2047 However, we did see lower new customers being added. \u2047 This gives us comfort that our core customers continue to see the value in our platform even during these challenging times. \u2047 We maintained our average monthly revenue per recruitment package customer versus the year ago quarter at $1,131 or $13,572 on an annual basis. \u2047 This is important as over 90% of Dice revenue is recurring and comes from recruitment package customers. \u2047 Our Dice customer renewal rate was 57% for the second quarter, down 13 percentage points year-over-year and our revenue renewal rate was 61%, which was down 19 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. \u2047 These lower renewal rates have a minimal impact on in-quarter revenues, but do impact contracted revenue and will result in lower revenue during the term of the related contracts. \u2047 And while we did see lower in-period renewal rates, that is customers renewing prior to or at contract termination, we are maintaining an ongoing dialog with these non-renewal customers with the expectation that they will resign when there is further recovery in the economy. \u2047 In addition, we hired a new leader for our Client Success organization who is implementing new processes around on-boarding and ongoing touch points that should have a positive impact on both customer and revenue renewal rates. \u2047 As we look at Dice, our strategy continues to be on larger customer relationships through moving upstream in terms of our marketing efforts, sales activities and go-to-market approach. \u2047 We believe this will put us in the best position for stability and growth. \u2047 Currently, approximately 15% of our customers generate 50% of our recruitment package revenue though no one customer makes up even 1% of revenue. \u2047 We think this is a good balance of a strong stable revenue base without having significant customer concentration risk. \u2047 ClearanceJobs' second quarter revenue was $7.1 million, an increase of 3% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. \u2047 This continued solid double-digit revenue growth year-over-year is reflective of ClearanceJobs' strong innovative products and competitive differentiation. \u2047 Second-quarter revenue for eFinancialCareers was $6.2 million, down 15% from the first quarter and 21% year-over-year, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. \u2047 As expected, COVID negatively impacted our performance for eFinancialCareers during the quarter. \u2047 In the U.K., which is our largest geography by revenue for eFC, we were impacted by the COVID shut down and U.K. furloughs, which have been extended through October of this year. \u2047 In the APAC region, eFC's second largest geography, we continued to experience difficulties primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. \u2047 Turning to operating expenses. \u2047 Second quarter operating expenses were $31.3 million, representing a decrease of $1.7 million or 5% year-over-year. \u2047 This decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of the comprehensive cost management exercise which began in late March and continues currently. \u2047 For the second-quarter, sales and marketing expense decreased $1.5 million year-over-year to $12.3 million. \u2047 The majority of our cost savings was associated with the reduced digital marketing spend for candidates, given that there has been a larger amount of candidate engagement naturally during the work from home environment. \u2047 And even while we accelerated the deployment of new product features in the second quarter, our product development expense decreased $617,000 year-over-year to $3.8 million, as a result of higher capitalization rates associated with these projects. \u2047 Income tax expense for the second quarter was $430,000, resulting in an ineffective tax rate of 19%, which is lower than our expected statutory rate of 25% due to the allocation of income between jurisdictions. \u2047 We recorded net income for the second quarter of $1.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to net income of $3.1 million"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q2 earnings per share of $0.04.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.04.  \u2047  q2 revenue $33.8 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share $0.04.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.04."]}
