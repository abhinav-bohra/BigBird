{"article": ["As detailed in yesterday's release, ABM generated strong third quarter results featuring double-digit growth in revenue, continued solid cash generation, and a 20% gain in adjusted earnings per share. \u2047 Revenue growth was broad-based as each of our five business segments achieved year-over-year gains in revenue, aided by an improving business environment and the gradual reopening of the economy. \u2047 Our team members once again executed well and continue to provide exceptional service to our clients. \u2047 Overall, demand for ABM's higher margin virus protection services remained elevated in the quarter, underscoring ongoing client concerns regarding cleaning and disinfection of their facilities. \u2047 As anticipated, demand for virus protection eased slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, but remain well above pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 The emergence of the Delta variant and rising COVID-19 cases nationally have gains heightened interest in the need for disinfection prevention measures, particularly in high traffic areas. \u2047 As we look forward to 2022 and beyond, we believe that virus protection services will remain a contributor to our overall revenue as disinfection becomes a standard service protocol and facility maintenance programs. \u2047 During the third quarter, we continued to benefit from efficient management of labor as office occupancy levels remain relatively low nationwide and began to trend downward slightly as the third quarter progressed due to the spread of the Delta variant. \u2047 In this evolving environment, our flexible labor model enabled us to capitalize on staffing efficiencies and the associated benefit to our margins. \u2047 In light of the current pause in the return to the office trend, we anticipate a more gradual ramp in office occupancy levels during 2022, providing an opportunity for a longer tailwind of rising from labor efficiencies. \u2047 At the same time, we are proactively addressing current dynamics in the labor market, which include heightened competition for available talent. \u2047 As I noted in last quarter's conference call, ABM has developed a task force model that leverages our substantial internal resources and cross-functional expertise to identify and implement solutions rapidly and effectively. \u2047 Earlier this year, we established a human resources task force with a specific focus on recruiting and retention, and this task force has been instrumental in helping us to manage our staffing needs and ensure our resources are allocated efficiently and cost effectively. \u2047 As a reminder, roughly half of our revenue is generated from union labor accounts, which mitigates concerns around labor inflation and availability. \u2047 Revenue growth in the third quarter was led by performance of our Aviation segment, where revenues increased 51% compared to the prior year period and the segment operated profitably. \u2047 Our strong performance in aviation reflected a seasonal improvement in air travel as well as our strategic shift toward securing high margin and more stable service contracts with airports and related facilities. \u2047 While revenue in our Aviation segment remains below pre-pandemic levels, we expect to see continued growth, driven in part by new airport transportation and janitorial contracts. \u2047 Our Technical Solutions segment continued to perform strongly, generating nearly 23% revenue growth in the third quarter as our broad capabilities address key client needs for energy efficiency, productivity and mechanical performance throughout their facilities. \u2047 Revenue growth benefited from improved access to client sites, enabling us to execute on a large number of projects Technical Solutions ended the third quarter with a record backlog level and the long-term outlook for this segment is particularly favorable given our position as a leading provider of electrical vehicle charging infrastructure. \u2047 Although EV charging infrastructure services currently represent a limited portion of Technical Solutions revenue, electrical vehicle adoption continues to rise, aided by the current administration's target to make half of all vehicle sold in 2030 zero emissions vehicles. \u2047 As a result, we see a long runway of growth for our e-mobility EV charging infrastructure business as we look out over the next several years. \u2047 Turning to Education segment. \u2047 School districts have accelerated the return to in-person learning, as we estimate that 95% plus of K-12 and higher education institutions will resume in-school classes this fall. \u2047 With the reopening of schools and educational facilities, Education segment revenue grew solidly from the prior year period, driven by increased demand for our services. \u2047 We believe the heightened concerns amid the prevalence of the Delta variant may lead to incremental opportunities for disinfecting services in the fourth quarter and into 2022. \u2047 But we do expect our labor savings from hybrid environment will wane quickly with a return to full-time in-person learning this fall. \u2047 Overall, our scale and market diversity and breadth of service keep us well positioned for growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. \u2047 Given the strength of our year-to-date performance and our positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.45 to $3.55, up from $3.30 to $3.50 previously. \u2047 On the acquisition front, a few weeks ago we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Able Services in a strategic transaction that we believe will create significant value for all of our stakeholders. \u2047 We're excited to join with Able's talented team and we look forward to working together to better serve our clients with a broader array of services and solutions that address their evolving needs. \u2047 The combination of ABM and Able expands our core engineering and janitorial capabilities in attractive geographies. \u2047 This acquisition is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share from day one, aided by an estimated $30 million to $40 million and cost saving synergies. \u2047 As a larger company with enhanced scale, we will be better positioned to provide our clients with service offerings that will not only enhance our growth and margins, but will add significant value for our clients. \u2047 We also see the potential for revenue synergies over time as we deepen our client relationships and realize cross-selling opportunities. \u2047 We are progressing on the close of this acquisition, which we expect will occur by the end of September. \u2047 As a reminder, we have not included any contribution from Able in our updated guidance forecast. \u2047 In closing, the past nine months have been exciting, productive and successful for ABM. \u2047 We have executed well on our strategic growth objectives, while generating strong financial results, and we are very much looking forward to the addition of Able Services to ABM. \u2047 In the next few months, We plan to share with you our strategic plan for the next five years, which I am extremely excited about. \u2047 Third quarter revenue was $1.54 billion, an increase of 10.7% from last year. \u2047 This improvement was driven by revenue growth in each of our five business segments, reflecting an improving business environment and continued demand for our virus protection services. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, the loss from continuing operations was $13.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $56 million or $0.83 per diluted share in last year's third quarter. \u2047 The GAAP loss from continuing operations in this year's third quarter is attributable to a reserve of $112.9 million, equivalent to $1.24 per diluted share. \u2047 The fully resolved previously announced outstanding litigation, you will find additional information related to the legal settlement in our Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today. \u2047 Excluding the impact of reserve taken in the third quarter as well as other one-time factors including a favorable prior year self-insurance adjustment of $26.1 million, our adjusted income from continuing operations was $61.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to $50.1 million or $0.75 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. \u2047 The increase in adjusted income from continuing operations was primarily the result of strong operational performance, including growth in our higher margin services. \u2047 Additionally, our results benefited from several other factors, including efficient labor management, one less workday compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and lower bad debt expense. \u2047 Corporate expense for the third quarter increased by $27.5 million year-over-year. \u2047 The majority of this increase reflects a more normalized expense level in this year's third quarter as furloughs and other cost saving measures taken at the beginning of the pandemic reduced corporate expenses in the same period a year ago. \u2047 The increase in corporate expense this quarter also reflects planned investments of approximately $9 million, as we continue to execute on our technology transformation initiative. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, we have invested $29 million in information technology and other strategic initiatives relative to our previously disclosed target of $40 million for the full fiscal 2021 year. \u2047 Now turning to our segment results. \u2047 Revenue in our largest segment, Business & Industry, grew 6.7% year-over-year to $807.7 million, benefiting from increased office occupancy in the quarter as well as continued elevated demand for virus protection services. \u2047 In addition, we saw improved demand for sports venues, as spectator attendance levels increased significantly from the prior year period. \u2047 Operating profit in this segment grew 18.2% year-over-year to $84.7 million, reflecting efficient labor management, reduced bad debt expense and ongoing client demand for higher margin virus protection services. \u2047 Our Technology & Manufacturing segment generated revenue growth of 1.2% year-over-year to $246.1 million, and operating profit margin improved to 10.4%, up from 10.1% last year. \u2047 Since most of our clients in the T&M segment are considered essential service provider, this segment has been least impacted by COVID-19 disruption. \u2047 As a result, segment revenue grew modestly on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 However, the segment operating profit margin increased 30 basis points from the prior year period, reflecting lower bad debt expense. \u2047 Education revenue grew 10.5% year-over-year to $208.4 million, driven by the reopening of schools and other educational institution amid a return to in-person learning. \u2047 Education operating profit totaled $17.7 million, down 3.3% from the same period last year. \u2047 Although the return to school trend increased demand for virus protection services, the resumption of more normalized staffing levels reduced overall margins compared to the prior year, which benefited from minimal staffing requirement. \u2047 Aviation revenue increased 51% in the third quarter to $175.7 million, marking the first period of year-over-year revenue growth in the Aviation segment since the third quarter of fiscal 2019. \u2047 Revenue growth was fueled by a rebound in U.S. passenger levels amid significantly busier summer travel season compared to the same period last year, as well as our increased focus on securing more business with airport and related facilities. \u2047 Aviation operating profit improved to $10.3 million compared to an operating loss of $8.2 million last year. \u2047 Aviation segment margins continued to improve on a sequential basis, rising to 5.9% in the third quarter from 3.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. \u2047 The improvement in operating margin is attributable to a favorable shift in business mix as we emphasize higher margin airport facility contracts and from stronger client demand for virus protection services compared to the prior year period. \u2047 Technical Solutions revenue increased 22.7% year-over-year to $146.1 million, highlighting continued strong market demand for our energy efficiency solutions as well as improved access to client sites. \u2047 Segment operating margin was 9.9% in the third quarter compared to 11.1% in last year's third quarter, reflecting a higher personnel costs compared to last year's third quarter, which benefited from pandemic-related cost saving actions. \u2047 I'll now discuss our cash and liquidity. \u2047 We ended the third quarter with $505.4 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $394.2 million at the end of fiscal 2020, with total debt of $811.6 million as of July 31, 2021. \u2047 Our total debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including standby letters of credit was 1.4 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2021. \u2047 In June, we announced an expansion of our credit agreement to $1.95 billion. \u2047 The benefits of this revised and expanded credit facility include enhanced financial flexibility as well as increased liquidity to fund strategic growth initiatives. \u2047 Additionally, the revised agreement has more favorable credit term on both the revolving credit facility and the term loan. \u2047 As you know, we recently announced the pending acquisition of Able Services for $830 million, which we plan to pay using a mix of cash on hand and borrowings from our credit facility. \u2047 Following the close, we expect to have very manageable bank leverage ratio of approximately 3 times. \u2047 Supported by strong cash flow of the combined company, we intend to reduce this leverage ratio in a timely manner. \u2047 Third quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations was $87.6 million compared to $130.9 million in the third quarter of last year. \u2047 The decrease in cash flow from continuing operations during the third quarter was primarily due to a deferral in payroll taxes last year under the CARES Act. \u2047 For the nine-month period ending July 31, 2021, operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $258.8 million, unchanged from the same period last year. \u2047 Free cash flow from continuing operations was $79.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, down from $121.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. \u2047 The decrease in free cash flow reflected the CARES Act payroll tax deferral I mentioned. \u2047 During the third quarter, we were pleased to pay our 221st consecutive quarterly dividend of $0.19 per common share, returning an additional $12.8 million to our shareholders. \u2047 Our Board also declared our 222nd consecutive quarterly dividend, which will be payable November 1, 2021 to shareholders of record on October 7, 2021. \u2047 Now, I'll discuss our outlook. \u2047 As Scott mentioned, our increased guidance for full year fiscal 2021 adjusted income from continuing operations is now a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per diluted share, compared to $3.30 to $3.50 per diluted share previously. \u2047 The increase in our adjusted earnings forecast is due to our strong financial performance over the first nine months of fiscal 2021, as well as our favorable outlook for the fourth quarter of the year. \u2047 Please note that this guidance excludes any impact from our pending acquisition of Able Services. \u2047 At this time, we are not providing guidance for full year 2021 GAAP income from continuing operations since we are unable to provide an accurate estimate and timing of the items impacting comparability relating to the Able Services acquisition, such as acquisition-related contingency advisory fees and integration costs. \u2047 We continue to expect a 30% tax rate for fiscal 2021 excluding discrete items such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credits and the tax impact of stock-based compensation awards. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["abm industries q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.90.  \u2047  q3 gaap loss per share $0.20 from continuing
