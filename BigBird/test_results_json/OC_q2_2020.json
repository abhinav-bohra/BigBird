{"article": ["Throughout this past quarter, our global team has demonstrated tremendous resiliency, continuously adapting to changing market conditions and maintaining an incredible focus on taking care of each other, supporting our customers and maximizing our financial performance relative to the market opportunity. \u2047 Prith will then provide additional financial details on the second quarter, and then I'll come back to discuss our outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. \u2047 I will start with safety and our second quarter results. \u2047 An unconditional commitment to safety has long been our guiding principle at Owens Corning, and this has served us well to address the challenges of COVID-19. \u2047 In the quarter, our recordable incident rate was 0.69, a slight improvement compared with the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 I'm pleased with this performance and that everyone has kept safety and caring for each other the forefront of everything we do. \u2047 Over the past several months, our executive team and dedicated COVID-19 response team have worked with our global enterprise to ensure our operations remain safe and effective for our employees, their families and other key stakeholders. \u2047 We remain vigilant in our use of personal protective equipment, health screenings, robust cleaning procedures, restrictions on business travel and work-from-home options as we actively monitor local health conditions and update our operating protocols as risk levels change. \u2047 I would like to now move to our financial performance in the quarter. \u2047 Through the strength of our market-leading businesses, innovative product and process technologies and unique enterprise capabilities, the company delivered financial results better than what we outlined during our last earnings call as we capitalize on a faster recovery in residential end markets, particularly in the U.S., improved manufacturing leverage and strong cost controls. \u2047 For the second quarter, revenues were $1.6 billion, down 15%, 14% on a constant currency basis compared with the same period last year, and adjusted EBIT was $167 million. \u2047 Since the start of the pandemic, we've been focused on four key areas to ensure the strength and continuity of our business. \u2047 First, keeping our employees and other key stakeholders, healthy and safe, as I just discussed. \u2047 Second, staying closely connected to our customers, our suppliers and our markets. \u2047 Third, rapidly adapting our businesses to near-term changes in market conditions, while remaining focused on positioning us for long-term success. \u2047 And fourth, ensuring a strong balance sheet with access to capital as needed. \u2047 I remain confident that by managing these four priorities well, we will continue to deliver strong performance for the remainder of this year and position the company well for 2021. \u2047 During this time of increased demand uncertainty, we have stayed closely connected with our customers and suppliers to understand and respond to shifting market conditions. \u2047 After experiencing a significant drop in order volumes at the start of the quarter, we continue to see our business improve in May and June as shelter-in-place restrictions began to lift, and demand for our products in most of our end markets increased. \u2047 As mentioned earlier, we have seen residential markets in the U.S. and also in parts of Europe recover at a faster pace than many had anticipated, which positively impacted our second quarter results. \u2047 In our Roofing business, after temporarily curtailing operations earlier in the quarter, we ramped up production to run at full capacity to service increasing demand. \u2047 And in Insulation, we have experienced solid demand in our North American residential fiberglass business due to the strong recovery in U.S. new construction housing. \u2047 Within most of our commercial and industrial end markets, the recoveries has been slower, and we continue to take the necessary actions to balance our production with expected near-term demand. \u2047 Given the essential products we provide and the localized nature of our supply chain, we've been able to operate our manufacturing network effectively and productively, quickly adjusting to the changing needs of our customers while managing our inventories. \u2047 In addition, our team has delivered great results during the quarter around cost control. \u2047 We have focused on minimizing or postponing discretionary expenses and reduced operating expenses in the quarter by over $30 million compared with last year. \u2047 We are also realizing benefits from the longer-term structural changes we made prior to the pandemic in our Insulation and Composites businesses. \u2047 In insulation, we are clearly seeing the impact of the network optimization actions implemented late last year. \u2047 And in Composites, we have maintained a consistent focus on manufacturing productivity and network optimization to lower our cost, which is evident in the results we delivered in the quarter despite the challenging market conditions. \u2047 We maintained a strong balance sheet with access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. \u2047 While our financial position at the beginning of the quarter was strong, in May, we took advantage of favorable capital markets and successfully completed a 10-year $300 million bond issuance. \u2047 This, along with our working capital management and opex and capex controls, led to an increase in our available liquidity to approximately $1.5 billion, including almost $600 million in cash. \u2047 During the second quarter, we paid down $210 million on our existing revolving credit facility. \u2047 Our only near-term debt maturity is the remaining $150 million from our term loan due in February 2021. \u2047 Before turning it over to Prith to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail, there's one other item I would like to highlight. \u2047 Last month, Owens Corning ranked number one on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for 2020, and is one of only a small number of companies that have earned this honor twice. \u2047 The list ranks companies in the Russell 1000 index for standout global environmental, social and governance performances. \u2047 We were honored by this recognition, which is evidence of our continuing commitment to integrate high ESG standards into all that we do. \u2047 We believe our commitment and that of the entire business community to improving environmental, social and governance issues is critical to addressing the extraordinary challenges we all face today with racial inequalities and other social injustices which have been compounded by the economic and health uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 These issues have and will continue to have a tremendous impact on how we work and live. \u2047 At Owens Corning, we believe in the power of our diversity and aspire to create an environment where all of our employees' voices are heard and appreciated for their unique value. \u2047 Our team has been and will continue to be active, vocal and promote meaningful reform. \u2047 As a company, I'm proud of our people, the work we've done so far and what I know we will accomplish in the future. \u2047 Through the collective agility and resilience of our 19,000 colleagues, Owens Corning delivered solid financial performance in the second quarter in the face of a challenging environment. \u2047 We have continued to respond to dynamic market conditions by adjusting production and maintaining discipline on operating expenses and capital investments throughout the quarter. \u2047 In addition, we have taken a number of actions to increase liquidity and reinforce our cash position, which gives us the financial strength and flexibility to navigate uncertainty caused by COVID-19. \u2047 The tables in today's news release and the Form 10-Q include more detailed financial information. \u2047 For the second quarter, we reported consolidated net sales of $1.6 billion, down 14% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis. \u2047 Revenues were down in all three segments as a result of the demand decline from COVID-19. \u2047 Although the recovery in residential end markets in the U.S., particularly in May and June, has been more robust than what many would have expected from the initial slowdown due to shelter-in-place restrictions. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT for the second quarter of 2020 was $167 million, down $64 million compared to the prior year, largely driven by a $61 million decline in Composites. \u2047 Net earnings attributable to Owens Corning for the second quarter of 2020 were $96 million compared to $138 million in Q2 2019. \u2047 Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $96 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared to $141 million or $1.29 per diluted share in Q2 2019. \u2047 Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $116 million, up slightly as compared to Q2 2019. \u2047 Our capital additions for the second quarter was $47 million, down $60 million versus 2019. \u2047 On slide six, you will see our adjusting items, reconciling our second quarter 2020 adjusted EBIT of $167 million to our reported EBIT of $171 million. \u2047 During the second quarter, we took actions to reduce personnel costs in our Composites segment and recorded $5 million of restructuring costs associated with these actions. \u2047 In addition, we recognized $9 million of gains on sale of precious metals used in our production tooling. \u2047 As we discussed in last quarter's call, our productivity initiatives and further developments in our manufacturing process technology have enabled us to modify the designs of our production tooling by reducing the precious metal needed and thus allowing us to sell certain precious metal holdings in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT of $167 million was down $64 million as compared to the prior year. \u2047 Roofing EBIT decreased by $3 million. \u2047 Insulation EBIT decreased by $10 million. \u2047 And Composites EBIT decreased by $61 million. \u2047 General corporate expenses of $19 million were down $10 million versus last year, primarily due to our disciplined cost controls. \u2047 Sales for the second quarter were $595 million, down $9 million from Q2 2019 on a constant currency basis. \u2047 During the quarter, our overall volumes were impacted throughout the segment by COVID-19, and selling prices were down $6 million year-over-year. \u2047 Within North American residential fiberglass insulation, sales volumes were largely consistent with Q2 2019 and some favorable price realization on the January price increase helped to partially offset negative price carryover from last year. \u2047 In technical and other building insulation, volumes were down. \u2047 However, we saw sequential improvement within the quarter. \u2047 We were encouraged by the resiliency of our mineral wool businesses in Europe and in the U.S., which maintained flat volumes year-over-year. \u2047 EBIT for the second quarter was $32 million, down $10 million as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower sales volumes. \u2047 We are continuing to proactively balance production with expected demand. \u2047 In the quarter, higher curtailment costs in technical and other insulation were largely offset by favorable manufacturing performance and better production leverage in North American residential fiberglass insulation, allowing us to see stronger results versus prior downturns. \u2047 Sales in Composites for the second quarter were $398 million, down 23% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower sales volumes. \u2047 The remaining decline in sales was driven by unfavorable customer mix and slightly lower selling prices. \u2047 Volumes in our downstream specialty applications, including wind and specialty nonwovens, outperformed volumes in other glass fiber applications. \u2047 EBIT for the quarter was $6 million, down $61 million from the same period a year ago, primarily due to lower sales and production volumes. \u2047 The negative impacts from production curtailments were slightly offset by manufacturing productivity improvements in the quarter. \u2047 The benefit of lower transportation costs was more than offset by lower selling prices and negative foreign currency translation. \u2047 Despite these difficult global market conditions, the Composites business still delivered positive EBIT margins and strong cash flow performance in the quarter due to continued focus on operating performance and initiatives around costs and productivity that we have discussed previously. \u2047 slide 10 provides an overview of our Roofing business. \u2047 Roofing sales for the quarter was $677 million, down 13% compared with Q2 2019 due to lower shingle volumes, $23 million of lower selling prices and lower third-party asphalt sales. \u2047 Our shingle volumes tracked relatively close with the overall U.S. asphalt shingle market. \u2047 We believe the market decline was driven by destocking at distribution early in the second quarter, coupled with lower out-the-door demand in April. \u2047 EBIT for the quarter was $148 million, down just $3 million from the prior year, and yielding 22% EBIT margins for the quarter. \u2047 The negative impact of lower sales volumes and early quarter production curtailments was partially offset by lower marketing and administrative expenses. \u2047 In addition, we realized a $10 million onetime gain that benefited our margins by 150 basis points related to an exclusion on certain tariffs paid over the last two years. \u2047 The U.S. government recently provided a tariff exclusion covering certain components products that we imported from China dating back to late 2018. \u2047 Input cuts deflation and lower transportation costs more than offset the negative impact of lower year-over-year selling prices. \u2047 As a result, we maintained a favorable price/cost relationship in the quarter, and cash contribution margins were solid as we exited the quarter. \u2047 Given the unpredictable market environment, we are continuing to take actions to manage our working capital balances and reduce both operating expenses and capital investments. \u2047 As a result, first half free cash flow in 2020 was $15 million higher as compared to the first half of 2019 on lower year-over-year earnings. \u2047 We are proactively managing inventories and will temporarily curtail operations that have adequate inventory to service near-term market demand. \u2047 We continue to be focused on managing our liquidity through this period of high uncertainty. \u2047 In May, we took advantage of favorable capital markets to reinforce our cash position and successfully completed a 10-year $300 million bond issuance with a yield below 4%. \u2047 We also generated cash in the second quarter through the sales of precious metals that I discussed earlier and cash settlements related to certain U.S. dollar-euro cross-currency swaps. \u2047 Near the end of the first quarter, we drew $400 million on the revolver to increase our cash balance. \u2047 With our good year-to-date free cash flow and the financial actions I described a moment ago, we paid down $210 million of the revolver balance in the second quarter. \u2047 As of June 30, the company had liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion, consisting of $582 million of cash and equivalents and nearly $900 million of combined availability on our revolver and receivable securitization facility. \u2047 As a result of the proceeding, we currently expect interest expense to be between $125 million and $130 million in 2020 compared to our previous guidance of $120 million to $125 million. \u2047 Moving forward, we are focused on ensuring a strong balance sheet with access to capital as needed. \u2047 We continue to evaluate the possibility of paying the remaining $150 million term loan balance in 2020. \u2047 As we move into the second half of the year, our financial performance will continue to be impacted by the depth and duration of the market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Given the continued uncertainties we face with the pandemic and potential government responses, I'll focus"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.88.
