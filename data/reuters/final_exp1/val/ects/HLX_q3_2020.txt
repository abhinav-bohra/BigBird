We hope everyone out there and their families are doing well and staying safe.
The third quarter typically represents the peak activity period for our operations with operators taking advantage of the summer weather to complete key projects, but this is not a normal year.
Our operations continue to be impacted by the depressed OFS market, largely resulting from COVID-19.
We are incurring incremental cost for the additional logistics and safety protocols and controls required to operate in this environment.
This difficult market and the operational challenges will continue until the pandemic is behind us and perhaps longer during the recovery period thereafter, but our team continues to address these issues head-on.
We've implemented strict cost controls.
We warm-stacked the Seawell and the Q7000 in Q2, significantly reducing their costs.
In Robotics, we have expanded our renewables offering and are benefiting from our first site clearance project.
Revenues in Q3 were reported $193 million with the net income of $25 million and EBITDA of $53 million.
Our gross profit increased to $35 million from $30 million the previous quarter.
For our year-to-date results, our revenues were $574 million with the net income of $18 million compared to $581 million of revenues and net income of $50 million through the same period in 2019.
We generated EBITDA of $120 million through the first three quarters of 2020 compared to $147 million in the same period in 2019.
On to Slide 8.
From a balance sheet perspective, our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $259 million compared to $178 million in Q2.
During the quarter, $42 million of restricted cash was released.
We generated $53 million of operating cash flow and spent $2 million on capex.
During the quarter, we issued $200 million of 6.75% convertible senior notes due 2026 to refinance $90 million of 2022 notes and $95 million of 2023 notes.
This refinancing provides us a longer liquidity runway, while allowing us to continue our goals of reducing our long-term debt.
Our net debt at the end of the quarter was $98 million.
Moving on to Slide 10.
We continued to operate in a different and challenging environment presented to us by the COVID-19 pandemic, with our teams and partners, both offshore and onshore, continued to respond well, doing a fantastic job.
In the third quarter, we had 13 vessels working and on hire globally in four countries.
We have enhanced our proactive control measures designed to keep our vessels operating.
We have tested over 6,500 of our employees and third-party personnel prior to joining the vessels and have experienced very little exposure on our vessels since testing protocols were adopted.
We continue to take appropriate steps to protect our employees, clients and third-parties, including holding abundant surplus PPE supplies for the offshore teams, mandating that all personnel wear masks while on the vessels and in our offices and facilities.
We've continue to enhance regular deep cleaning and social distancing measures.
In the North Sea and West Africa, two vessels remained warm-stacked with considerably reduced operating cost of those vessels and we've also reduced targeted SG&A spending.
Over to Slide 11.
Even in this COVID-19 environment, during the third quarter, we produced reasonably strong results with revenues of $193 million resulting in increased profit margin of 18%, producing the profits of $35 million compared to $199 million revenue and $30 million gross profits in the second quarter.
Considering the effects of the virus and the continued warm-stacking of two vessels, we attained good levels of utilization.
The Well Intervention fleet achieved utilization of 68% globally and Robotics chartered vessel fleets achieved utilization of 95% globally.
This year continues to be our best performing period in relation to safety statistics and operational uptime and the third quarter was no exception.
Our fleets operated with 99% uptime efficiency in the quarter was again LTI free.
It is extremely pleasing to know our team continues to perform at such a high standard producing solid operational performance.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved new records for the Q4000, completing the longest pipeline clean-up from an intervention vessel.
The Q5000 continued throughout the quarter with BP with no commercial downtime.
In the North Sea, the Seawell remained warm-stacked in Leith, Scotland, and the Well Enhancer had a good quarter working for four clients.
In the West Africa region, the Q7000 remains warm-stacked in the Canary Islands and is planned to commence transit back to Nigeria in Q4, commencing contracted work early in Q1 next year.
Usual high standards of performance in Brazil, both vessels performed very well achieving high utilization of 99%.
Robotics chartered vessel fleet was very active, working between ROV support, trenching, renewable works globally, completing 450 days of utilization across seven vessels, with five of the vessels working outside of the oil and gas markets on renewables projects.
Slide 12 provides a more detailed review of the operations for our Well Intervention business in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Q5000 had 100% utilization, continuing to work for BP, undertaking ultra-deepwater production enhancement operations, performing extremely well with zero commercial downtime with continued integration of our Helix Schlumberger Alliance teams.
The vessel remains on contract for the remainder of the year.
The Q4000 performed well with 85% utilization due to a small gap in schedule alignment between projects, completing work in ultra-deepwater for three clients.
The Seawell production enhancement project was completed, achieving record-breaking deepest water depth set from an intervention vessel.
The vessel then went on to set another record for a client -- for the next clients by completing the longest ever pipeline clean-up set from an intervention vessel.
After a short gap, the vessel completed a production enhancement project for another client and the vessel is currently contracted through most of November and has recently been contracted for good portion of Q1 next year.
Moving on to Slide 13.
Our North Sea Well Intervention business has been most affected by the reduced work requirements due to COVID, leading to the continued warm-stacking of the Seawell.
The Well Enhancer, however, has worked into October and has several other potential smaller work scopes identified for the fourth quarter.
The Well Enhancer achieved 92% utilization, working for four clients in the quarter, including completing free production enhancement scopes of three clients and an abandonment scope for another customer.
The vessel has recently completed work and has kind of been warm-stacked in Leith, Scotland.
It remains operationally ready, should the potential visible fourth quarter works become contracted.
The Seawell remains warm-stacked in Leith, Scotland, which significantly reduced operating cost, reduced crew levels to a minimum men in allowance.
We will keep both monohull vessels in warm-stacked condition throughout the winter seasonal period as in previous years and are optimistic we will reactivate both vessels in 2021 due to visibility of higher activity levels.
The Q7000 remains in warm-stack mode in Tenerife in the Canary Islands and again significantly reducing our daily operating cost of the vessel.
The vessel is planned to transit back to Nigeria at the end of Q4 to commence contracted work in Q1 2021, now that the country logistics allow.
Moving on to Slide 14.
In Brazil, our operations for Petrobras continue to go extremely well, again producing another quarter of operational excellence with continued strong performance regarding safety, uptime and efficiency.
Both vessels achieved strong utilization in the third quarter and we continue to be ranked as one of the top rig contractors by Petrobras.
The Siem Helix 1 completed abandonment work on three wells after conducting a client paid diver whole fee in order to meet strict environmental requirements prior to working in a protected area.
The Siem Helix 2 completed the production enhancement work on two wells and abandonment work on two wells in the quarter.
Moving on to Slide 15 for our Robotics review.
Robotics had a good quarter and continues to have a very good year, operating seven vessels during the quarter with five vessels working on non-oil and a gas, renewables projects.
We continued to expand our renewable energy services by product line and geographically now to include trenching, site clearance and survey, accommodation and installation support, secure renewable energy works in Europe, East Coast, USA and Taiwan.
We have also recently been contracted to undertake further renewables projects in Q4 in Japan.
In the third quarter, charter vessel fleet utilization was 95%, including 291 days from spot chartered vessels.
In the North Sea, four vessels were utilized primarily on renewable energy projects.
The Grand Canyon III was utilized 73%, undertaking renewables trenching and the Kristiansand and the World Peridot were 100% utilized, continuing site clearance and survey works on the wind farm project.
Also in the North Sea, we spot chartered a large construction vessel to undertake a decommissioning projects in conjunction with Well Ops U.K. group.
Well Ops working on the subsea wells and Robotics contract in this vessel to remove the subsea infrastructure.
In the APAC region, the Grand Canyon II had 100% utilization performing works on a renewable energy projects in Taiwan, providing accommodation and installation support.
We have secured work in 2021 and 2022 to provide a ROV support in the APAC region, which will provide a foundation for our continued presence in the region.
In the Gulf of Mexico, our pay as we go vessel, the Ross Candies had 51 days of utilization, working on ROV support for six clients.
The T1200 trenching unit was utilized 100% on the client provided vessel on the U.S. East Coast, conducting wind farm trenching works.
As mentioned previously, the Robotics group is having a good year, especially expanding services globally into the renewables sector.
Over to Slide 16.
I'll leave this slide detailing the vessels already in trenching utilization for your reference.
Moving to Slide 18, it outlines our debt instrument and the maturity profile, September 30th.
Our total funded debt was $415 million.
During the third quarter, we issued a new $200 million convertible senior notes due 2026, with the 6.75% coupon.
This was done to extinguish $90 million of our 2022 convertible notes and $95 million of our 2023 convertible notes.
This transaction effectively refinanced $185 million of our convertible senior notes, maturing in '22 and '23 into 2026.
A lot of the strength in our liquidity position providing greater flexibility to manage near-term maturities during these challenging times.
Slide 19, this provides an update on key balance sheet metrics, including long-term debt and net debt levels at September 30th.
Our net debt approximated $98 million.
Cash position at the end of Q3 was $259 million.
Our quarter-end, net debt to book capitalization was 5%.
Moving over to Slide 21 for a discussion on our 2020 outlook.
We are refining our guidance for 2020 as follows: Revenue in the $710 million to $735 million range; EBITDA $135 million to $145 million; and free cash flow in the $50 million to $85 million.
Our year-to-date results are in line with our previous guidance and represent an upward adjustment to nearly all metrics.
The expected activity levels in our markets for the fourth quarter support our guidance.
This range includes some key assumptions, expectations and estimates as follows.
We're assuming the full quarter to Siem Helix 1 and 2 in Brazil.
We expect the Q4000, Q5000 will have good utilization in the fourth quarter, although the Q4 has gaps to fill in the second half of the fourth quarter.
Well Enhancer has been warm-stacked, although we are pursuing small projects later in the quarter.
Robotics activity will decrease commensurate with increased weather risk and completion -- or pricing of the projects.
As is typical for our business, overall, we expect the step down in the fourth quarter with the onset of the winter season in the North Sea.
Any significant variation for these key assumptions could cause our EBITDA to fall outside of the range provided.
Providing more color by segment and region on Slide 22.
First, our Well Intervention segment.
U.K., North Sea, the Well Enhancer completed its contracted work in mid-October.
The vessel has been stacked while small projects late in the quarter is still a possibility.
Seawell remain stacked, unlikely to work in 2021 -- until 2021.
The Q7000 is warm-stacked with the expected mobilization to start in late Q4 for work in Q1.
The Gulf of Mexico, the Q5000 is working for BP and expected to remain on hire for the balance of 2020.
Q4000 has contracted work into November, is pursuing opportunities with expected schedule gaps for the balance of Q4.
In Brazil, the Siem Helix 1 and 2 are on hire for the balance of 2020.
Moving to our Robotics segment.
Robotics continues to be more resilient in this market than Well Intervention.
Work in the renewables wind farm sector has continued mostly incurred by current events, although activity will diminish in the fourth quarter as normal with the onset of the winter season in the North Sea.
Grand Canyon II in APAC is on contract into Q4 and expected to have good utilization for the balance of 2020.
Great Canyon III will be performing trenching in the North Sea for multiple customers with expected strong utilization.
Ross Candies is expected to continue to operating on a pay as you go basis over the near term.
Our wind farm survey and site clearance project continues into Q4, but the duration will be weather dependent.
We also completed a decommissioning project using in the VOO in mid-October with an additional project scheduled later in Q4.
Moving to Production Facilities.
The HP1 is on contract for balance of '20, with no expected change.
As we have previously stated, we intend to continue to aggressively reduce our cost commensurate with the levels of activity by asset and overhead.
Continuing on Slide 24, moving into our capex.
Forecast remains at $38 million for the year, comprised primarily of the recertification cost of our vessels, the majority of which has already been spent in Q1.
Reviewing our balance sheet.
Our funded debt of $450 million is scheduled to decrease by $10 million as a result of scheduled payments in the fourth quarter.
Our restricted cash position of $42 million was released on July 17th, although it may be required again with return to work in West Africa.
Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $259 million.
We anticipate tax refunds in the amount of approximately $19 million in the near term as a result of the tax changes from the CARES Act.
I'll skip Slide 26 and leave it for your reference.
Well, you've heard the Helix and other companies say the market outlook is challenging.
Most other companies may be referring to their balance sheets.
Fortunately, we took action earlier in this year to manage our balance sheet to minimize this as one of our challenges and extend the runway of debt maturities out to 2026.
As we've said for a while now, we feel that we have sufficient cash on hand and forecasted cash flow to meet our debt obligations with the ultimate goal of achieving gross debt zero position with our balance sheet.
Our intention will be to pay down another $101 million of our debt by the end of 2021 and continue to operate with low leverage going forward.
We all know what happened to commodity prices in the early part of this year and the pandemic is still obviously ongoing with no end date that anyone can reliably predict.
During this time, it's become clear, the OFS market has fallen out of favor with the investing community and banks and investors and some producers have begun to pivot to alternative energy and renewables.
Expectations of supply and demand have evolved to a forecast of a longer than expected recovery.
For the past few reporting cycles, we have predicted the slow and gradual recovery in demand with balanced supply and demand as early as sometime in 2022, where commodity prices do depends on the extent of recovery in the unconventional market as a successful conclusion of the COVID reaction and/or timing of successful vaccines and therapeutics, it also depends on opaque discipline.
It's less clear as to what the effect of negative investor sentiment and banks will have on our industry's capacity to recover.
On top of this, we are uncertain as to what the industry's pivot to renewables means for their oil and gas budgets going forward.
They'll still need the cash flow to sustain investment in renewables.
We believe that the oversupply of the OFS market will persist in spite of the service supply destruction taking place.
The rig and vessel market is going through recapitalization almost across the board.
If this leads to consolidation then a rationalization of supply may occur.
If companies emerge with cleaned up balance sheets, but continue to irrationally fight for market share in an oversupplied market.
we believe it will hamper an OFS market recovery.
Regardless of the adverse effect of all the uncertainties of particular significance to Helix, the number of reservoirs reaching maturity, for example, having only PDP and ultimate abandonment will be a growing market, no matter what else happens.
While this is a long term positive for Helix as this is part -- this is -- at this part of the market growth and the OFS capacity declines, generating opportunities for Helix, it will take patience, adaptability and discipline to get there.
Helix operates the only riser-based non-rig intervention assets in the world and it's not likely that you'll see others build anytime soon that would alter that significantly.
It's now generally accepted that these assets and methodologies are both more efficient and have a significantly reduced carbon footprint relative to drill rigs.
However, we must operate within the realities of the environment we work in and unfortunately, the present environment is exceedingly unstable and marked by uncertainty.
In addition to some market stability and increase in commodity prices would go a long way to help us realize revenues commensurate with our world-class assets.
For the near term and as the pandemic has continued on, this uncertain market is not conducive to long-term contracts as the producers have begun to signal that they are less inclined toward long-term, multi-year contracts to rigs.
They got caught last time with these committed costs.
Given the drop off of oil and gas related work, it's also our opinion that the OFS market and specifically, the intervention market may return to being a spot market at least until the market stabilizes in commodity prices and/or the demand for work on mature wells increases.
It may be too soon to predict what will happen but we are inclined to believe the next year or two may see a return to spot market work award rather than multiyear contracts.
We've had just three long-term contracts in our history and up until around 2014, when access to intervention assets was perceived as an issue, intervention had always been a spot market.
Very few producers have the well account to support multiyear contracts for intervention and that has not changed.
Our goal is always to show our customers the value proposition we can deliver, but we also recognized that at least in the near term, those producers that can support long-term contracts are also dealing with an uncertain market, where it's a challenge to commit to long-term spending.
But our business was built on winning work in the spot market.
The majority of our contracts are still won in the spot market and we've proven to be very adept at competing in this type of market.
We also have several ways to adapt and improve our offerings, creative contracting terms others can't offer, our capacity to take on management and life extension of reservoirs through abandonment and we have an increasing geographic footprint.
And for those producers who are serious about sustainability in their own ESG story, based on our asset base and efficiencies, we believe the lower overall carbon footprint versus drill rigs is achievable.
We also generated almost 10% of our 2020 revenues from the renewables market.
This was the foothold that we'll seek to increase.
Before anyone jumps on this as being a game changer, let me just say that the increase of interest in renewables and the projected exponential growth of the market, almost every contractor, including start-ups and -- are all gravitating to renewables, and overly aggressive strategy in renewables is not without risk.
We'll be looking to grow our contribution from renewables, but we are in a -- and we feel like we're in a good position, but we're going to be prudent in carrying out this growth strategy.
When we see opportunities and to minimize risks, we'll be proactive on our participation in the renewables.
I hope this provide some context to what we mean when we say that we see the market continuing to be challenging for the next couple of years.
The ongoing pandemic and events earlier this year have drastically changed the landscape of the world and the OFS market has been knocked back.
The market continues to constantly evolve, the longer the uncertainty of our sector remains, but we positioned the company for a long-term recovery and that's not changed.
We still believe we're well positioned to navigate the current environment and have tremendous leverage to an eventual market recovery.
We believe the current challenges for the OFS market are also factors that will lead to a stronger market on the other side and will hasten that time to a more robust recovery.
We also see opportunities that can offset some of the challenges ahead and we are pursuing those.
Operator, at this time, we'll take questions.
