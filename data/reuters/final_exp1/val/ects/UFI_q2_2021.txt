And then, Eddie and Craig will follow me with the details of the Q2 performance, and then we'll have a Q&A.
So, Q2 was a very positive quarter for us as we saw a nice recovery from the COVID impacts.
We still have plenty to work to do, but this quarter was a strong step forward.
While our revenue was slightly below prior year, it was better than our internal expectations and then both November and December revenues were above the prior year.
Our adjusted EBITDA performance was very strong, it was double versus year ago.
But we had some tailwinds, and we also had some upsides in a few areas, particularly from our Brazil segment.
But even after you normalize those items, we still performed significantly better than prior year.
Our balance sheet continues to show improvement.
Inventory levels, cash and net debt are all in a good position.
And then Craig will take you through the details of that very shortly.
So as you look into the second half of 2021, we're optimistic.
However, we aren't entirely certain about the most recent spike in COVID cases and how it might impact retail consumption or our people in the plants.
But we believe the good news on the vaccine should create some optimism for our future quarters performance.
I wanted to comment on two broad positives that are outside the financials.
I think both of these strengths will provide a positive impact to our business for the balance of the year, and then even beyond that.
First, we have the right leadership team in place from top to bottom.
Some of you who follow us remember, about a year ago that wasn't the case.
So from top to bottom, our team brings significant amount of company and industry knowledge.
They have really shown resilience during this COVID time.
They work well together and we are now beginning to see the value of leadership continuity in our performance.
The second positive trend appears to be an acceleration of momentum on environmentally sustainable products from our customers and also from consumers, especially young consumers.
Well, I think feel that they want to do something positive for our environment coming out of this pandemic.
And this shows up on our mix for REPREVE.
So our sales mix for REPREVE has maintained an upward trend and has moved now to a record level of 37% in Q2.
It was 35% in the last quarter and in the high 20s a year ago.
Additionally, the request for our REPREVE Hangtags have gone up significantly.
These hangtags, you may know are fixed to the product containing REPREVE and they help tell the recycle story.
And in the last six months, we shipped 45 million hangtags and that compares to 33 million a year ago during that same period.
So it's up a third.
We believe that many of our customers are now taking action on sustainability commitments that they've made for 2025.
These environmental goals are things that have to be accomplished for our customers, and the date is getting closer, 2025, closer than we really think.
So I think overall, the environmental sustainability is a definite megatrend that's only going to go up from here, whether you're talking about brands or public policy or in society, coming out of the pandemic.
So in summary, I'd say, Q2 was a very solid quarter with some real nice momentum.
We just announced that yesterday.
Emma has extensive marketing background, general management and strategy experience, and she's had experience with companies like PepsiCo, Hanes Brands, Red Hat, and she is an independent Director at Bassett furniture.
And today, she is the Founder and CEO of MarketVigor, a marketing company.
I can tell you that Emma brings the skill set that is very complementary for our Board and we are delighted to have her on the Unifi team.
As Al mentioned, our second quarter fiscal 2021 results outperformed our initial expectations and they are a reflection of our strong global presence and the resilience of both our employees and our business model.
This strong quarter would not have been possible without their many contributions.
I'm very pleased to report the health and safety protocols that we put in place at the beginning of the pandemic allowed us to maintain normal operations, positioning us well for further recovery.
On slide 3, we provided an overview of the quarter.
The business performed well during the second quarter and is approaching pre-pandemic revenue levels.
Our Q2 revenues were up 15% from Q1 with meaningful improvement across all segments and geographies.
The flexibility of our global business model and its innovative components continues to allow us to adapt and quickly capitalize on new efficiencies and market share opportunities.
Key drivers to the 670 basis point increase in gross margin year over year are results of continued focus on cost, outperformance by the Brazilian segments, and the expansion of our REPREVE and other innovative products, all as more volume -- as more normal volumes occur.
Now, despite a challenging environment, our team's dedication and hard work contributed to Unifi achieving its best quarterly profit since June 2016 and the best second quarter profitability in 10 years.
The demand for sustainable solutions continues to grow, and so is interest in our REPREVE branded fibers.
This includes most of our new customer adoptions and our new co-branding opportunities, which continue to increase REPREVE's contribution to sales.
The pre-fiber sales now represent a record 37% of consolidated net sales compared to 35% in the previous quarter.
Additional details about REPREVE fiber sales are shown on slide 4.
While these Q2 results will be hard to sustain in the short term, it's clear that the COVID crisis has enabled our organization to find new efficiencies and drive ongoing productivity across our manufacturing platforms, while pursuing market share opportunities when they arise.
It's is certainly an exciting time for everyone in the company and I'm looking forward to building on our current performance long-term as we assume the underlying business momentum will remain intact.
Lastly, our work toward strengthening our balance sheet has allowed us to execute on growth focused capital allocation priorities.
Shortly after the second fiscal quarter ended, we made the strategic acquisition of Fiber & Yarn Product Inc's nylon portfolio.
While this transaction was of similar size to the Texturing Service LLC transaction we committed to just three months prior, it's an important step forward in our efforts to strengthen the Nylon segments and its capabilities.
We are excited about the addition of Fiber & Yarn customers to our portfolio and expect a quick and seamless integration process as this business transitions to our Madison, North Carolina operations.
Now we have several exciting brand highlights to discuss today starting with our partnership with Disney.
For the holiday season, Disney launched T-shirts and thesis [Phonetic] in their Orlando park stores prominently displaying REPREVE signage at point of sale.
This is a follow-on to their April 2020 online launch of T-shirts made with REPREVE.
Disney has the abilities to market our consumer relevant circular economy story since Unifi continues to process plastic bottles collected from Orlando parks into a REPREVE resin and yarns.
Also, we had an expansion of our business into workwear.
Aramark has launched a proto shirt made with REPREVE to customers looking for durable, sustainable work garments.
And another recent success is a towel program at Nordstrom.
These towels are available online and at retail and were developed through our Turkey supply chain operations.
Another example of how we are able to leverage REPREVE in the home goods space.
Then there is Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss also utilizing the REPREVE brand.
Tommy Hilfiger REPREVE is seeing continued strength in swim and activewear with some international placements.
And Hugo Boss has launched athletic inspired footwear with a 100% REPREVE upper.
This small sampling is an impressive list of partners and clients and we're both humbled and excited at the extension opportunity we have to build further and expand these relationships with leading global brands.
This activity is driving the increased shipments of hangtags that Al mentioned in his remarks, representing a sizable growth in on-product co-branding.
This sustained increase in co-branded items in the market represents strong momentum among brands and retailers to recognize that the REPREVE ingredient brands helps provide a quality, transparent, sustainable -- sustainability story for their customers.
Now, I will provide some high level comments on our operating segment performance during the second quarter before Craig takes you through more specific details.
The Polyester segment benefited from a better production and sales mix along with raw material and pricing stability.
Sales volumes continue to normalize and we remain optimistic on sales mix going forward for this segment.
The Asia segment continued to demonstrate signs of improving business conditions and further recovery to pre-pandemic levels.
Volumes were up meaningfully and benefited from pull through on new and existing customer programs and margins were aided from supply chain efficiencies and a richer sales mix.
Brazil, as you've seen, had a record second quarter.
The strong performance was primarily driven by our unique position in the region and our ability to capitalize on the dynamics of the market, which is dominated by imports.
Similar to the first quarter, we were able to capture unfulfilled demand and maintain a strong market position.
And looking ahead, we are forecasting some moderation of our profit growth in the region given how strong it's been recently.
The local Brazilian team continues to work to the best of their abilities to maintain and expand the solid market share they've captured.
Lastly, the Nylon segment's performance met our expectations for the quarter, reflecting a more balanced sales level.
Despite being modestly down year-over-year, the sequential increase in segment sales is encouraging and positive sign for this business.
Like the rest of the team, I'm very pleased with our second quarter of fiscal 2021 results and our ability to navigate this recovery with strong cash and liquidity positions.
Eddie highlighted the changes from the just completed second quarter to our first quarter of this fiscal year.
I will provide our normal commentary on the just completed quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, which for the past few quarters has not been as meaningful due to the impacts of the pandemic.
Let's start with the sales comparison on slide 7.
Polyester segment volumes were just 1.1% lower than the prior year, and raw material costs drove pricing down but were partially offset by a richer sales mix to generate a 7.3% decrease in net sales.
For the Asia segment, lower volumes negatively impacted net sales by 8.1%, while the lower raw material cost impacted pricing, generating an overall 6.7% decrease in net sales after considering some favorable foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the renminbi against the US dollar.
Brazil segment outperformed 21.7% growth from higher volumes, while strong pricing levels helped to nearly offset the significant unfavourability of foreign currency translation due to the weakening of the real against the US dollar.
Lastly, the Nylon segment showed signs of stability, with revenues just 6.3% below the prior year following sales mix changes.
Moving on to the gross profit overview on slide 8, every segment exhibited an increase.
The Polyester segment benefited from a more favorable raw material and pricing environment along with a richer sales mix and manufacturing efficiencies, achieving a gross margin of 14.2%.
The Asia segment benefited from raw material sourcing improvements and a rich sales mix, driving gross margin to 14.6%.
For Brazil segment, again with its sales outperformance, doubled both gross profit dollars and gross profit as a percentage of sales from the prior year by gaining market share and achieving strong pricing during the just completed quarter.
The Nylon segment also exhibited year-over-year improvement as operational improvements led to a higher level of gross margin.
For Unifi overall, gross profit was $25.9 million and a 670 basis point increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales.
As you move down the income statement, our SG&A remained consistent with our expectations, driving strong operating income that further led to significant improvements in pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share, generating expensive year-over-year increases.
Slides 9 and 10 show the sales and gross profit comparisons for the first half of fiscal 2021 compared to the first half of fiscal 2020.
Moving on to the balance sheet on slide 11, further improvement in our debt and liquidity positions is demonstrated by maintaining diligence around working capital components and generating cash flows.
With great progress on our net debt metric, we continue to have zero borrowings on our ABL revolver which had an availability of $56 million as of December 27, 2020.
Unifi's commitment to financial health has allowed us to leverage our strong balance sheet during [Indecipherable] challenged by the global pandemic.
We have had the opportunity closing 2 acquisitions and we'll continue to allocate capital for new texturing technology in Amer -- in the Americas.
With a balanced capital allocation approach, share repurchases and further debt reduction can occur at appropriate times.
In short, after normalization begun taking effect for China and India imports, imports of polyester textured yarn surged from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.
We petitioned for an investigation into this activity and the respective US agencies have thus far determined there is a reasonable indication of material injury.
Consistent with the first round of anti-dumping investigations that spanned calendar 2019, we expect these investigations to occur over the majority of calendar 2021.
And we will provide relevant updates as they occur.
However, we are still not able to offer the specificity of outlook that we gave before the pandemic, but we are looking forward to returning to an outlook similar to our past disclosures in the near future.
We expect global demand uncertainty and risk associated with the COVID-19 pandemic to persist into the second half of the fiscal year.
The second quarter's strong performance supports our expectation of incremental progress during the fiscal 2021 and as such, we anticipate net sales trends will continue to improve on a sequential basis returning to pre-pandemic levels in the March quarter.
We are encouraged by the recent trends in our REPREVE and other value-added products and expect recent strength to continue long-term.
With this sustained business momentum, adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve by low double-digit percentage of the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal 2020.
That expectation includes a few factors.
Continued strong performance by the Brazil segments albeit tempered from the record-setting December 2020 quarter.
Unfavorable seasonal domestic shutdown impacts to gross profit for the polyester and nylon segments.
Unfavorable impact of the Chinese New Year holiday for the Asia segment, and raw material cost pressures due to the recent increases in petroleum prices.
Lastly, given our momentum from the second quarter, our annual capex spend remains consistent with our expectation from the first quarter and should fall in the range of $22 to $24 million, excluding amounts related to the acquisitions.
To conclude, I believe, our strong performance during the second quarter reflects our unique business model and the upside potential that it has during normal economic conditions.
Going forward, we will continue to focus on partnering with global brand leaders that want to position themselves using sustainable products, innovating and repositioning the business to drive long-term organic growth, diligent cost management initiatives to drive gross margin improvement and maintaining our strong financial position and strong balance sheet to expand our growth opportunities through strategic M&A.
