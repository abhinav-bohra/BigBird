We encourage you to review all of these materials.
Today, you will hear from our president and chief executive officer, Tom McInerney, followed by Dan Sheehan, our chief financial officer and chief investment officer.
Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer period.
Our actual results may differ materially from such statements.
Also, when we talk about results of our Australia business, please note that all percentage changes exclude the impact of foreign exchange.
And finally, references to statutory results are estimates due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statements.
First, I'd like to discuss the status of our pending transaction with Oceanwide.
Then I'll touch on progress across several Genworth's other strategic priorities and provide a brief overview of our strong third-quarter results before turning the call over to Dan Sheehan, Genworth's chief financial and investment officer.
Earlier this week, Genworth announced that Oceanwide had made significant progress toward the Hony Capital funding and other requirements in order to close the Oceanwide transaction.
As indicated in the documentation submitted to Genworth, Hony Capital expects to be able to finalize the $1.8 billion financing in November.
Oceanwide is also focused on the funds in Mainland China that will provide the remaining amount of capital required to pay for the total purchase price of $5.43 per share, so that we can close the transaction by November 30, subject to timely receipt of regulatory approvals and clearances.
Additionally, Oceanwide had made progress in the China regulatory process, submitting updated information and requesting confirmation of the extension of the acceptance of the filing from the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission or NDRC.
We are extremely pleased with Oceanwide's progress and update.
Genworth's chairman, Jim Riepe, and I have maintained regular communication with chairman Lu and Oceanwide throughout this process, and we will continue to maintain a dialogue with them as they were to complete the remaining steps to close.
We are hopeful that Oceanwide's transaction funding will be completed in time to close the transaction by November 30, without the need for an additional extension.
We look forward to providing further updates as we work toward a successful closing of the transaction.
In parallel with the transaction process, we have remained focused on executing well and continuing to enhance Genworth's liquidity position in order to meet our ongoing capital obligations.
These plans include raising $750 million of debt at U.S. MI holding company level which we completed in the third quarter.
Certain of those proceeds will be used to address our $338 million of debt maturing in February of 2021 which Dan will discuss as part of our overall liquidity position in his remarks.
We also continue to take steps to prepare for a potential IPO of our U.S. MI business.
We are making good progress on these efforts, and we'll continue to take steps to position ourselves to launch an IPO, subject to market conditions, if the China Oceanwide transaction is further delayed or terminated.
We are also making great progress on our multiyear LTC rate action plan or MYRAP which remains essential to stabilizing our legacy long-term care insurance business.
Year to date, we have received approvals on $595 million of annualized in-force premiums representing a weighted average premium increase of 29% or $173 million of annual incremental premiums going forward.
On a cumulative net present value basis, since 2012, Genworth has now achieved approximately $13.5 billion of approved LTC premium rate increases.
We are committed to developing industrywide solutions to enhance the vitality of long-term care insurance industry through our continued involvement with the NAIC and its long-term care insurance executive task force.
To this end, NAIC subgroup was recently formed to focus on LTC insurance-reduced benefit options.
We are working to identify options and develop recommendations to provide customers with more choices regarding modifications to their LTC contract benefits where policies are no longer affordable due to rate increases.
We delivered strong net income of $418 million and adjusted operating income of $132 million led by outstanding performance in our U.S. mortgage insurance business.
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact Genworth's businesses in a number of ways.
In the third quarter, we saw sequential improvement in unemployment trends, lower levels of new mortgage delinquencies relative to the second quarter and a robust mortgage origination market, all of which benefited the U.S. MI business.
Mortality remained elevated relative to the prior year which had a mixed impact on the LTC and life insurance businesses.
U.S. mortgage insurance reported adjusted operating income of $141 million compared with an adjusted operating loss of $3 million in the prior quarter and adjusted operating income of $137 million in the prior year.
The sequential improvement was driven by lower delinquencies and incurred but not reported or IBNR, favorability.
MI achieved $26.6 billion and new insurance written during the quarter, up 41% versus the prior year driven primarily by higher refinance originations and a larger private mortgage insurance market.
At the end of the quarter, U.S. MI's PMIERs sufficiency ratio was 132%, an excess of $1 billion above the published requirements.
Our Australia MI business reported adjusted operating income of $7 million, up from $1 million in the prior quarter and down from $12 million in the prior year.
Capital levels remained strong with approximately AUD 300 million above management targets.
In response to continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, we are preserving capital in Genworth mortgage insurance subsidiaries, and, therefore, we do not expect to receive further dividends from the mortgage insurance businesses in 2020.
The amount and timing of dividends in 2021 will depend on a variety of factors including the timing of economic recovery from COVID-19.
life insurance, we delivered adjusted operating income of $14 million, up from a loss of $5 million in the prior quarter and a loss of $1 million in the prior year.
This total included an adjusted operating loss of $69 million in life insurance due primarily to higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs versus the prior quarter and year, offset by adjusted operating income of $59 million in long-term care insurance and $24 million in fixed annuities.
In long-term care insurance, we are still seeing higher-than-normal claim terminations in part due to COVID-19 as well as lower incidence of new claims.
We have strengthened our IBNR reserves as a result and are continuing to monitor these trends closely.
I am proud of the continued strong execution across our teams, all of whom are continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers in a remote work environment.
Out of an abundance of caution, we have decided to maintain our office closures and work-from-home status until a safe vaccine is widely available to the general public.
Based on recent vaccine guidance, we will not open our offices any earlier than June 1, 2021.
While uncertainty remains high, we are confident that we're taking the right steps to position our businesses to navigate uncertainty focusing on the factors we can control, continuing to operate effectively and maintaining strong capital positions in our mortgage insurance businesses.
We will continue to maximize the company's value for our shareholders by taking proactive steps to improve our financial flexibility, while working tirelessly toward a successful conclusion of the merger with Oceanwide.
Today, I will cover our financial results for the third quarter, capital positions of our subsidiaries and holding company liquidity.
While we continue to face challenges created by the pandemic, I'm pleased with the overall progress made in each of these areas during the quarter with improved earnings, strong capital ratios in our mortgage insurance businesses and incremental liquidity at the holding company.
We reported net income available to Genworth shareholders for the quarter of $418 million and adjusted operating income of $132 million.
The primary driver of the difference between adjusted operating income and net income was $250 million of net gain from the sale of U.S. Treasury scripts and our life insurance business, as we continue to reposition the portfolio at a time when the market value of those securities had appreciated significantly.
The U.S. mortgage and housing market has remained resilient through this period of uncertainty with improving home prices, a very large origination market and moderating delinquencies from the earlier peak.
Our U.S. MI business has benefited from its participation in this market which includes strong underlying mortgage credit quality fundamentals.
We're pleased with the performance of the business and the improvement in delinquency and loss trends.
MI's third-quarter financial results improved sequentially primarily driven by lower levels of new delinquencies and incurred but not reported reserve or IBNR, favorability.
For the quarter, U.S. MI had adjusted operating income of $141 million and reported a loss ratio of 18%.
While new primary delinquencies during the third quarter were still elevated versus pre-COVID levels, they were down 66% sequentially, with approximately 75% of new primary delinquencies being reported in forbearance plans which may cure in an elevated rate.
Our assumed eventual claim rate or roll rate for the quarter's new delinquencies once again blended a lower expectation of claims for delinquencies currently in forbearance plans with a higher expected claim rate for delinquencies outside of the forbearance plan.
We continue to rely on our past hurricane-related roll rates which were materially lower given prior effectiveness of forbearance and our experience to set for forbearance roll rates through the pandemic.
In addition to improvement in new delinquencies, U.S. MI released $23 million of the $28 million increase of IBNR reserves that was established in the prior quarter as new delinquency trends improved.
Our servicer reported forbearance trends which are a leading indicator of delinquencies, have declined from peak levels in May and ended the third quarter with 6.7% and or 61,200 of our active primary policies reported in a forbearance plan, with 63% of those in forbearance being reported as delinquent.
We ended the quarter with 49,700 total primary delinquencies or a delinquency rate of 5.4%, both of which decreased sequentially as cures outpaced new delinquencies in the quarter.
Primary new insurance written in U.S. MI was $26.6 billion in the quarter, up 41% versus the prior year primarily driven by higher refinancing activity and a larger private mortgage insurance market.
We estimate our market share will be strong, but down sequentially, as our updated view of risk under the prevailing conditions impacted our participation in forward commitment transactions and our decision to adjust our pricing more generally.
While our primary Insurance In Force has grown 15% versus the prior year, lower persistency partially offsets the strong new business levels.
In Australia, the economy continued to recover with stability in the unemployment rate and moderating declines in home prices, although it will be some time before the economy fully recovers to pre-COVID levels.
During the quarter, the Australian federal government and Australia's large banks extended the home and business loan deferral program which will allow eligible borrowers additional assistance beyond the original six-month forbearance period.
Approximately, 7% of total Australia households are utilizing these programs, down from 11% last quarter.
For Australia MI, approximately 3% of our insured loans or 31,000 loans, are currently participating in these forbearance programs, down from over 48,000 loans at June 30, 2020.
Under Australia regulatory guidelines, these loans are not reported as delinquent.
The business increased its loss reserves by USD 18 million last quarter and $24 million this quarter to account for current macroeconomic conditions, disruption to normal delinquency patterns and uncertainty regarding payment holiday deferrals.
Adjusted operating income for Australia for the third quarter was $7 million, up from $1 million in the prior quarter and down from $12 million in the prior year.
U.S. GAAP loss ratio for the quarter was 37% which was lower than the prior quarter, 63% and slightly higher than the prior year.
Low interest rates and gradually improving consumer confidence following the initial COVID-19 lockdown drove $5.5 billion of flow NIW which was up 14% sequentially and 17% versus the prior year.
Consistent with prior years, in the fourth quarter of 2020, our mortgage insurance business in Australia is expected to complete its annual review of its creaming and earnings pattern.
In addition, the business will continue to assess the appropriateness of its loss reserves, as the pace of the economic recovery and changes to delinquency patterns including payment holiday deferrals become clearer.
Turning to U.S. life.
The segment reported adjusted operating income of $14 million for the third quarter, our U.S. life businesses continue to experience elevated mortality across all of our products, in part, attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We also continue to experience negative impact on DAC amortization and reserves from our 20-year term and 10-year term universal life insurance blocks, as they enter their post level premium period.
life was up sequentially and versus the prior year included higher limited partnership income as well as favorable inflation adjustments on U.S. treasury inflation protected securities.
In long-term care, claim terminations were significantly higher in the third quarter versus the prior year and flat to the prior quarter.
Although we do not require debt certificates for LTC terminations and cannot make a direct attribution to official causes of death.
We do believe some degree of incremental terminations were the result of COVID-19, and we continue to monitor these trends closely.
Although new claim in curls on Choice 1 and Choice 2 blocks continue to grow with bay age, we've experienced favorable development on IBNR claims from lower new claim incidence overall.
Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, new claims submissions have decreased further, driving additional favorable IBNR development.
However, we do believe that this more recent reduction in incidence is temporary reflecting delays in reporting claims due to social distancing and shelter-in-place protocols and that our incidence experience will ultimately resemble previous trend.
As a result, we've further strengthened our IBNR by $24 million in the quarter.
The overall IBNR calculation will be reviewed and recalibrated during our fourth-quarter assumption review.
While the benefit reductions from in-force rate actions remained strong in 2020, they're lower relative to 2019 which benefited from several large state implementations.
Our filing activity for new rate actions also accelerated during the third quarter, and we expect that to continue through the remainder of the year.
These filings include newer product series for which we've not requested rate increases in the past.
They also include a variety of benefit reduction alternatives which we've seen more policyholders select.
During the quarter, Genworth received approvals impacting $338 million of premiums with a weighted average approval rate of 28%.
We remain engaged with state regulators on the importance of actuarially justified rate increases.
In addition to the approvals we've received so far this year, we're also working on current filings and hope to secure additional significant approvals during the fourth quarter of 2020.
Turning to life insurance.
Overall mortality for the quarter was elevated versus the prior quarter and prior year.
The third quarter included an estimate of approximately $12 million in COVID-19-related claims based upon death certificates received to date.
Absent the COVID-19 impacts, mortality would have been flat versus the prior quarter but modestly higher versus the prior year.
The term life insurance business was negatively impacted by shock lapses that continue to be higher than our original locked-in assumptions, as more of the large 20-year level premium term life insurance business written in the year 2,000 entered the post-level premium period during the quarter.
Total term life insurance stack amortization, a noncash impact primarily related to these term-life lapses, reduced earnings by $34 million after tax which is unfavorable compared to the prior quarter.
As sales levels declined in the second half of 2000, we expect amortization related to term policies entering the post-level period to begin to decrease in the fourth quarter and into 2021.
Going forward, given smaller block size and reinsurance agreements in place, we would expect term deck amortization on policies entering the post-level period to be lower than what we observed in 2019 and thus far in 2020.
Life insurance results also continue to be negatively impacted by losses in our term universal life insurance product.
As a reminder, this is driven by a dynamic of GAAP reserve build on certain of these policies, as they enter their post-level premium period without the offsetting premium revenue due to premium grace periods.
Though the impact in the current period was smaller than the prior quarter, we expect this negative dynamic will persist in the fourth quarter of 2020 and into the first half of 2021, after which the number of policies lapsing should exceed the number of policies entering the premium grace ticket.
In fixed annuities, lower net spreads compared to the prior quarter and prior year pressured earnings which was mostly offset by higher mortality and single premium immediate annuities.
In the runoff segment, our adjusted operating income was $19 million for the third quarter.
The segment benefited from equity market improvement during the quarter, though equity market performance was not as strong as it was in the second quarter.
For our U.S. life insurance companies, we're in the process of completing our annual review of key actuarial assumptions in the fourth quarter for each of our product lines as we've done in prior years.
As with most insurers with long duration products, we're focused on assumptions related to our long-term view of interest rates and current portfolio yields which impact loss recognition and statutory cash flow test.
In addition, certain of our universal life insurance products with secondary guarantees require separate testing on a statutory basis using the prescribe reinvestment rate from July to June each year.
Given the declining rates during this period, we currently believe that we will likely need to increase statutory reserves by approximately $200 million in 2020 which would equate to roughly a 15- to 20-point reduction in risk-based capital our Genworth life insurance company or GLIC.
For LTC, we expect to finalize the claims reserve review, concurrent with the active life reserve review also in the fourth quarter.
While this work is ongoing, current trends do not indicate a need to strengthen the claims reserve as assumptions appear to be holding up in the aggregate.
For corporate and other, our adjusted operating loss is $49 million for the third quarter.
This loss was higher versus the prior quarter primarily attributable to tax adjustments.
Our approximately $79 billion cash and investment portfolio continues to perform well given the uncertain macroeconomic environment.
The fixed maturity unrealized gain position continued to improve, reaching $9.2 billion at the end of the quarter reflecting improvements in the credit markets, benign credit migration and minimal impairments.
Turning to capital levels.
Our U.S. and Australian mortgage insurance businesses maintained strong capital positions at the end of the third quarter.
In U.S. MI, we finished the quarter with a PMIER's sufficiency ratio of 132% and or approximately $1.1 billion above published requirements as of September 30, 2020.
The decline in our PMIER's sufficiency versus the prior quarter was driven by strong new business levels partially offset by elevated lapses and the acceleration of the amortization of our existing reinsurance transactions.
In addition, capital credit from our 2009 to 2019 excess of loss contract decreased as delinquency development has been more favorable than previously expected.
These impacts were only partially offset by strong business cash flows.
In October, as part of our normal credit risk transfer program, we completed an insurance-linked note transaction which will provide an additional $350 million of PMIER's credit and would result in a PMIER sufficiency ratio of 147% against published requirements.
The PMIER's sufficiency calculation continues to include the effect of the 30% multiplier for eligible delinquencies associated with COVID-19.
Our Australia MI business ended the quarter with an estimated prescribed capital amount or PCA ratio, of 179% which is approximately AUD 300 million above the high end of the management target range of 132% to 144%.
Post quarter end, the business redeemed the remaining portion of its Tier 2 debt due in 2025, leaving only AUD 190 million outstanding due in 2030.
We estimate capital in Genworth life insurance Company or GLIC, as a percentage of company action level RBC to be approximately 240% as of the end of the third quarter, up approximately 15 points from the second quarter.
The improvement was primarily driven by LTC performance and a reduction in reserves on variable annuities related to the continued equity market recovery.
For holding company cash, we ended the quarter with $814 million in cash and liquid assets or approximately $450 million above our targeted cash buffer.
Approximately $340 million of the holding company cash balance is ring-fenced for our February 2021 senior notes maturity which we plan to pay at that time.
Cash uses in the quarter include $125 million paid to AXA in July as part of the agreed-upon settlement, $59 million for debt service and $18 million for 2021 debt repurchases that were made during open windows during the quarter.
For upcoming holding company debt obligations, we have principal balances of $338 million, maturing in February 2021 and $659 million, maturing in September 2021.
As we noted last quarter, we're not expecting dividends from our mortgage insurance businesses for the rest of 2020 to preserve capital in these subsidiaries, given the uncertainty of COVID-19.
To fully address the September 21 maturity, we continue to prepare for an IPO of our U.S. MI business, subject to market conditions, if the transaction with Oceanwide is further delayed or terminated.
Our agreement with Oceanwide affords us flexibility to pursue this or other paths to strengthen our liquidity position.
In closing, we've taken numerous steps to improve the liquidity and financial flexibility of our holding company as well as position our business to navigate these uncertain times.
We're pleased with the financial progress and remain focused on providing value to all of our key stakeholders.
With that, let's open it up to questions.
