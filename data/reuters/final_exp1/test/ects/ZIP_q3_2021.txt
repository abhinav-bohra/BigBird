Joining me on the call today are Ian Siegel, co-founder and CEO; and David Travers, CFO.
In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from GAAP results.
Reconciliations of the non-GAAP metrics to the nearest GAAP metric are included in ZipRecruiter shareholder letter and in our Form 10-Q.
At $212.7 million in revenue, the third quarter was another record for ZipRecruiter.
We're happy to deliver both top line and bottom line results above the guidance provided in our last call.
In a few minutes, Dave will walk you through these numbers and our increased expectations for the rest of the year.
We find ourselves in a unique economic environment.
In the Great Recession of 2008, for example, the labor force contracted by around 1 million workers and retail sales fell by about 40 billion.
It took over three years for retail sales to recover.
The COVID pandemic has been a different type of recession.
More than a year-end, the labor force is still smaller by 3 million workers, yet retail sales are now 90 billion higher than they were before the crisis, having recovered after only four months.
As a result, employer demand for workers is immense.
There are about 50% more job openings now than there were before the pandemic.
However, millions of job seekers still have not come back to work.
Further, we've seen record high numbers of workers who voluntarily quitting their jobs each month, finding new workers is critical for businesses to fill orders on time, expand production and grow.
Businesses know that success depends on their ability to win the war for talent.
ZipRecruiter is laser-focused on using smart software to help these employers of all sizes find great match candidates for their growing list of roles.
We believe we are uniquely positioned for long-term success during these extraordinary times and beyond.
Over the course of the quarter, we made significant progress against the three pillars of our marketplace strategy, increasing the number of employers, increasing the number of job seekers and making our matching technology smarter over time.
I'll highlight just a few achievements here, but I encourage you to read more in our shareholder letter available on our investor relations website.
First, one of the major frustrations job seekers face is a lack of control in the job search process.
Our technology has long been delivering curated jobs to job seekers.
In Q3 of 2021, we enhanced the new experience, allowing job seekers to see why they're receiving specific job recommendations.
This additional context leads to an increase in job seeker engagement, which in turn delivers more data with which we can better train our matching algorithms.
These contextual recommendations help bring transparency and put control back in the hands of the job seekers, providing them a richer, more interactive experience.
We also expanded our national TV advertising campaign to job seekers, adding two additional spots.
These spots focus on the difficulties inherent in the job search and how ZipRecruiter helps make the process less stressful.
After over a decade of investment in marketing to employers, we're eager to build the same level of brand awareness with job seekers.
We're proud of how our creative captures the value we provide to job seekers.
Please take a look for yourselves on our YouTube page.
Last week, we announced an integration with Worthy by City.
Worthy website allows job seekers to understand and acquire the skills needed to transition into a new industry.
Through an integration with ZipRecruiter, it's even easier for job seekers to find opportunities matching their skills and to be found.
Our own employees continue to thrive despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic.
This past quarter, we launched a new employee resource group named Queers Uniting Individuals at ZipRecruiter or QUIZ.
We now have six ERGs available for our employees.
These ERGs are delivering more than just a culture of acceptance and sharing internally.
Our women and leadership ERG organized a talent drive that successfully sourced dozens of diverse female candidates for jobs in our company.
It's groups like these and investments in our people that have resulted in two new awards from Comparably, Best Company For Happiness and Best Company For Work-Life Balance.
I'm excited about how ZipRecruiter is performing during such a unique time for our country.
We remain wholly focused on our mission to actively connect people to their next great opportunity.
Building on the momentum of Q2, our third quarter revenue of $212.7 million represented another record quarter, significantly exceeding our guidance.
This represents 107% growth year over year and 16% growth over the second quarter of '21, following up on a record-shattering 48% sequential growth in quarterly paid employers in the second quarter, quarterly paid employers were flat in Q3.
Revenue per paid employer increased by 16% sequentially during the quarter, reflecting our ability to expand our relationships with paid employers as they participate in our marketplace over time.
GAAP net income was $22.1 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $23.1 million in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $42.5 million, with a 20% margin, compared to $26.7 million in adjusted EBITDA or a 26% margin in the prior year.
The increase in revenue was offset by employee-driven expenses as well as an increase in our sales and marketing activities.
We believe year-over-year trends are more instructive than sequential comparisons since Q2 '21 included $31.9 million nonrecurring direct listing costs, as well as $41.7 million in stock-based compensation expense for a large number of historical RSUs that vested in the quarter, all timed with our direct listing.
After closing out another record quarter, we're pleased to increase our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021.
We expect $206 million of revenue in Q4 of 2021 at the midpoint, which translates to 80% year-over-year growth.
Our Q4 '21 guidance translates to a midpoint of $727 million for the full year, up from the $658 million shared last quarter.
This increased 2021 revenue guidance equates to 74% growth over 2020 at the midpoint.
While the hiring environment remained strong throughout the third quarter, our fourth quarter guidance foreshadows a gradual return to a more traditional macroeconomic pattern.
Additionally, Q4 has historically been seasonally slower as businesses slowed down hiring activity leading up to and through the holidays.
While the economic recovery overshadowed typical seasonality last year, this is a seasonal trend we have consistently seen prior to the pandemic.
We expect adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $35 million at the midpoint and $96 million at the midpoint for the full year.
This is a $62 million increase from full year guidance provided last quarter and equates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13%.
As hiring activity slows, we expect to reduce our sales and marketing activities in Q4 as compared to Q3.
However, our revised guidance does imply an overall increase in operating expenses when compared to previous guidance, driven by a larger investment in sales and marketing expenses in the early part of the quarter before the holiday slowdown.
As exciting as these financial results and our raised guidance are, we're even more motivated by the millions of job seekers who we helped find work by using ZipRecruiter.
And the employers who, as a result, have found a great new hire.
During the singular moment in economic history, we believe our work is more important than ever.
