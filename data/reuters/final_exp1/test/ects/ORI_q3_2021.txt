Well, our hard work is paying off, and we're very pleased to again report that ORI produced another terrific quarter with General Insurance and Title Insurance each posting exceptional results that drove the strong, record-setting consolidated results that you saw.
Compared to the third quarter of '20, total net premium and fees earned increased to just over $2 billion, up almost 19%.
At the same time, our pre-tax operating income increased to just under $300 million, up almost 32%.
And the consolidated combined ratio improved to 89.8%.
That's a 2.5 percentage point improvement.
Still comparing to the third quarter of '20, General Insurance saw net written premium increased by 4.3%.
And in Title Insurance, we saw net premiums and fees earned increased by over 33%.
So our diverse portfolio of specialty products in both General Insurance and Title Insurance continue to deliver growth and profitability.
And with that, I will now turn the discussion over to Frank to discuss some of the per-share figures, our investment portfolio and briefly touch upon our runoff mortgage business.
Then he'll turn things back to me to cover General Insurance, followed by Carolyn, who will discuss Title Insurance, and we will follow those discussions by opening up to Q&A.
So Frank, take it away.
For the first nine months of this year, this figure was $668 million, up nearly 50%.
Results for both periods were driven by substantial growth in underwriting profitability within our General and Title Insurance segments, which you'll hear more about shortly.
Shareholders' equity ended at $6.3 billion, resulting in book value per share of just under $21.
Adding back dividends, including the $1.50 special dividend paid in the quarter, book value increased 11% from year-end 2020, driven by our strong earnings.
Net investment income increased for the quarter, however, it was down slightly year-to-date.
The increased investment base, inclusive of proceeds from last quarter's debt issuance and lower yields on new investment purchases, affected both periods.
The investment portfolio consisted of approximately 71% in highly rated bonds and short-term investments, with the remaining 29% allocated to large-cap dividend-paying stocks.
The average maturity on the bond portfolio is approximately 4.5 years with both book and market yields of about 2.5%.
The fair value of the equity portfolio did decrease by about $200 million during the quarter due to normal market fluctuations.
However, we ended the period with unrealized gains on these investments of nearly $1.1 billion.
I'll now turn to claim reserves, which ended the period at just under $11.5 billion.
All three operating segments recognized favorable claim reserve development for all periods presented.
In total, the consolidated claim ratio benefited by 2.3 and two percentage points for this year's third quarter and first nine months, respectively, compared to 1.4 and 0.9 percentage points for the same period a year ago.
Finally, premiums and risk in force of our runoff mortgage operations continued to decline in line with our expectations while generating a modest operating profit.
Claim costs reflect a significant reduction in newly reported defaults compared to 2020 and lower claims severity resulting from increasing home values.
The group paid another $25 million dividend to parent, bringing the total to $75 million for the year.
And we expect to pay another $25 million dividend in the fourth quarter, but that will be subject to regulatory approval.
Total GAAP shareholders' equity for the mortgage companies ended the quarter at just under $400 million.
So in General Insurance, net written and net earned premiums each increased by just under 5%.
We continue to achieve strong rate increases on most lines of coverage other than workers' comp.
Compared to the third quarter of 2020, pre-tax operating income rose almost 33%, and that's primarily from improved claim ratios.
The overall combined ratio improved 4.2 percentage points from 95.5% to 91.3%.
The claim ratios we reported were, of course, inclusive of favorable prior period development, and that came in at 3.2 percentage points in the quarter.
Net premiums written in commercial auto grew by 5.4%.
Our third-quarter commercial auto claim ratio improved to 73.1%, compared to 80.4% in the third quarter of last year.
Claim frequency is not quite back to pre-pandemic levels, but it is higher than 2020.
Severity trends continue to increase although at a slightly lower pace than what we had seen in previous years.
Rate increases in auto liability are continuing in the 15% range.
So we think we're staying ahead of the overall loss trends that we're seeing, but we also recognize that we still need to achieve a lower claim ratio for auto.
Turning to workers' comp.
Net premiums written were lower by about 1% compared to the third quarter of 2020, somewhat reflecting our ongoing underwriting discipline to maintain rate levels.
The workers' comp third quarter claim ratio came in at 59% compared to 54.1% in the third quarter of 2020.
Claim frequencies now just slightly below pre-pandemic levels, while severity is slightly up, mostly driven by indemnity severity.
So for workers' comp, we think our rate levels are adequate, and we'll continue to maintain our underwriting discipline as we move forward with this line.
Our aggregated commercial auto, workers' comp, and general liability claim ratio came in at 65.9% compared to 72% in last year's third quarter.
In financial indemnity, property, and other coverages, we continue to experience favorable steady claim ratios and strong rate increases, all contributing to the improved combined ratio we're seeing in General Insurance.
So we continue with our underwriting excellence initiative that focuses on better segmentation, improved risk selection, and pricing precision, all aided by increased use of analytics.
And we think these efforts will continue to facilitate strong underwriting profitability, adequate rate levels, and continued high retention levels.
So I'll now turn the discussion over to you, Carolyn, who you, along with your team, have put together yet another terrific quarter.
Total revenue for the quarter of $1.1 billion was up 33% from the prior-year third quarter.
Year-to-date, revenue has already surpassed $3 billion, a 43% increase from the comparable period last year.
Our pre-tax operating income was $136 million for the quarter compared to $103 million in last year's third quarter, an increase of $33 million or 32%.
Year-to-date, our pre-tax operating income of $378 million exceeds pre-tax operating income for the same period last year by $166 million or approximately 79%.
Commercial premiums were up 73% over third quarter 2020 and represented 15.3% of our total premiums versus 13.6% in third quarter 2020.
While we have seen a drop in order counts, this is mostly a result of the slowdown in the refinance sector.
Purchase transactions, which generate a higher fee per order, are expected to remain strong as we close out the year.
In our technology portfolio, Pavaso remains the market leader in the number of digital closings completed.
We have seen an increase in digital closings, although, at this time, less than 5% of all closings in the industry are done digitally.
We are constantly investing in the platform, planning for the future expansion and greater adoption of digital closings across the industry.
Another part of our digital road map recognizes and addresses the need to optimally service our agents with an interconnected ecosystem of external partners and technologies that interact and exchange information throughout the entire business workflow.
The number of choices, partners, and technologies has rapidly grown and will accelerate in the future.
With a vision to integrate with anything, we have developed an integration platform built with the latest technology, architecture and security that will connect our applications and services with internal and external data service providers with standardized integrations that streamline onboarding and promote rapid adoption.
We continue to execute on our plan of blending the history of Old Republic solid business practices, procedures, and expertise with technology to fully unlock their measurable benefits across our business units.
As we enter the fourth quarter, we are so appreciative of our employees and customers as they continue to meet the high demands of the current real estate market.
As always, our guiding principles of integrity, managing for the long run, financial strength, protection of our policyholders and the well-being of our employees and customers will be at the forefront of all we do.
While we're extremely pleased with another quarter of exceptional operating results and we also continue to be very pleased with our specialty strategy, providing a wide range of specialty insurance and products to core industries served by both General Insurance and Title Insurance, which we believe continues to produce value for our shareholders.
In that announcement, we also indicated that Spencer LeRoy has been elected as Chairman of the Board.
And that the Board size has been reduced to 13 members.
