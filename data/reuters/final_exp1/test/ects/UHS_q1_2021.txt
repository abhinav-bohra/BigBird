We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
During the first quarter of 2021, we received approximately $188 million of additional CARES Act grant funds.
While we continue to experience residual effects from the COVID-19 virus, the net impact on loss revenues and incremental expenses in 2021 has not been nearly as severe as it was in 2020 and consequently, we have begun the process of returning these $188 million in CARES Act funds to the federal government and expect that process to be completed shortly.
As previously disclosed, we also returned $695 million of Medicare Accelerated payments to the federal government in the first quarter of 2021.
As I noted during the first quarter of 2021, we continue to experience certain unfavorable impacts on our operations and financial results from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Specifically, we experienced an increased wave of COVID patients in December 2020, which peaked in the first half of January 2021.
The negative impact resulting from this elevated level of COVID volumes was primarily a function of accompanying declines in elective and scheduled procedures and both acute and behavioral patient days, along with increased expense pressures particularly on salaries and wages and shortages of clinical personnel.
Our cash generated from operating activities was $72 million during the first quarter of 2021, as compared to $502 million during the same period in 2020.
The decline in cash provided by operating activities was driven by the aforementioned repayment of $695 million of Medicare Accelerated payments.
We spent $247 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2021.
Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 50 days during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to 55 days in the fourth quarter of 2020 as we recovered from the billing and collection delays we experienced in the fourth quarter as a result of our previously disclosed Information Technology incident.
At December 31, 2021, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 35.7% as compared to 41.3% at March 31, 2020.
In light of our expectation that COVID volumes are likely to continue a downward trajectory in 2021 as more vaccines become available and the accompanying pressures on our operations and financial results ease, our Board of Directors approved the resumption of our regular quarterly dividend with the first quarterly payment of $0.20 per share made on March 31st.
The Board also approved the resumption of our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021.
We are pleased with our first quarter 2021 operating results, which were just slightly ahead of our internal forecast.
The pace of the recovery from the pandemic is still difficult to predict with precision, but we assume the COVID impact will generally ease at an increasing cadence throughout 2021, and we remain comfortable that we will achieve our full year 2021 earnings guidance.
