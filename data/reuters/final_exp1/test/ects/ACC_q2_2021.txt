As we've noted on previous calls, 2021 is a year of transition toward a return to normalcy.
The fundamentals of our sector continue to strengthen, and we're quite pleased with our progress this quarter.
In Q2, our operational and financial results significantly exceeded our expectations with NOI and earnings per share beating our projections.
Specifically, quarterly rental revenue and ancillary income, including parking fees, utility, retail income, among others, were stronger than anticipated.
This was primarily driven by a higher volume of students signing leases for the spring and summer 2021 terms.
Secondly, the ramp-up of initial occupancy at our community serving the Disney College Program has been very strong.
Since the DCP program recommenced only two months ago, we have already moved in over 3,200 students.
And we continue to project 85% occupancy by the fall for the 4,996 beds delivered through Phase 5.
And finally, rent collections have largely returned to normal historical levels.
On-campus rent refunds and request for rent relief under our resident hardship program continue to decline and are anticipated to be insignificant in the 2021-'22 academic year.
Velocity for the 2022 same-store group surpassed the prior year's pace in early July and is now 310 basis points ahead of the prior year.
The guidance we have provided for the academic year '21 lease-up assumes strong opening rental revenue growth of 5.1% to 7.6% based on an occupancy range of 92% to 94% and an average rent per occupied bed growing at 3% to 3.5% for the '22 same-store group.
As we presented at the National Interface Student Housing Conference two weeks ago, the long-term fundamentals of the student housing sector are strong.
As evidence of the strengthening fundamentals in our space, we're once again seeing significant demand for on-campus housing.
For our on-campus ACE properties, where the university administers the lease-up, we are nearly 98% pre-leased.
We'll be closely monitoring move-in and attrition rates at these communities as these universities are administering their first full capacity move in since the commencement of the COVID pandemic.
Looking forward, we remain optimistic and continue to anticipate a return to our historic range of occupancy for the 2022, 2023 academic year as the long-term fundamentals of our sector are strong and appear to be gaining tailwinds.
Specifically, these tailwinds include record admission applications at the four year public and private universities we serve and target, universities nationwide resuming in-person academic and social activities and reinstating their on-campus housing policies for first year students in the fall of '21.
This will once again allow us the opportunity to implement our in-person and exclusive sports marketing program activities as we kick off the 2022 leasing season.
The tailwinds also include a significant downward trend in national new supply continuing at least through the 2022, 2023 academic year, including a currently projected decrease of over 20% in ACC markets.
And finally, university public-private partnership opportunities to modernize on-campus have returned and are exceeding pre-pandemic levels.
This environment provides the company a unique opportunity for earnings growth and net asset value creation based on the prospect of robust internal growth and high-quality external growth in the years ahead.
Turning to capital activities.
During the quarter, we renewed our corporate revolver, extending the maturity to 2025 and improved our borrowing costs by 15 basis points to LIBOR plus 85 bps.
Further, the updated facility demonstrates our long-standing commitment to ESG by introducing a sustainability-linked pricing, whereby the borrowing rate improves, if the company meets certain ESG performance targets, each year.
In fact, we believe that we're the first U.S. listed REIT to have included a performance component tied to each of the three pillars of environmental, social and governance.
Also, we raised $60 million of equity proceeds during the second quarter at a weighted average price of $49.05 per share, which was in line with analyst NAV estimates at the time and was allocated to the funding of the ongoing construction of our 6.8% high-yielding Disney development.
We thought it prudent to derisk our balance sheet, given that our pre-leasing status was lagging the prior year at that time.
There was and continues to be uncertainty that existed around derivative COVID strains and the lingering impact of COVID as previously noted.
In closing, we'd like to announce our plans to host an Investor Day at our Disney College Program housing development in Orlando on September 23 of this year.
We're very excited to showcase the project and other important initiatives underway within the company.
