These statements are subject to uncertainties and risks.
Actual results may differ materially from projections and could be affected by a variety of risk factors, including factors beyond our control.
For a discussion of these factors, we refer you specifically to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
Our Form 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2020, our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2020, which we anticipate being filed later today and our other filings with the SEC, which are available at the SEC's internet site, www.
sec.gov as well as on our website, www.
We continue to benefit from a high percentage of fixed revenue streams and have managed pandemic related logistical, health, safety and other costs in line with expectations.
As a result, cash flow from operations continued to be strong, particularly when considering the nearly 200 revenue days lost during the quarter to plan the drydock operations.
Even signs of a stalling recovery in the main fuels markets in which we are active, we've taken steps to preserve value and to strengthen our liquidity in anticipation of heightened volatility in the months that lie ahead.
With a strong balance sheet and prospects for a sustained economic recovery in 2021, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and the fundamentals of our business.
Our niche businesses provided the core strength to our diversified portfolio.
Our shuttle tanker, lightering and MSP vessels all operated at or above expectations during the quarter, once again demonstrating the stabilizing impact on period-to-period performance of these specialized vessels.
This quarter, the vessel's operating contribution from our niche market activities provided $22 million.
Adding to the solid foundation of niche vessel contributions is the emerging importance of our ATC tanker fleet in the makeup of our earnings base.
As we expected, the acquisition -- this acquisition is proving to have been an important development for OSG.
With $16 million in TCE revenue earned and $8.1 million of vessel operating contribution from these assets, our ATC tankers saw utilization rates of 100% of available days during the quarter just ended.
Given the multiyear time charter commitments remaining for these vessels, we expect they will continue to provide a stable and solid cash contribution base.
In delivering these results, our most important management challenges have been and will remain sustaining operational readiness at all times.
Since the one shipboard case of a positive COVID-19 test experienced in early July, we have not experienced any further shipboard outbreaks and have seen no loss of revenue days or extraordinary expenses incurred as a result of COVID-19 on board any of our vessels.
However, maintaining a virus free environment, onboard operating vessels will be a continuing important focus.
As the spread of the virus expands within our community, we remain prepared for all higher periods resulting from managing virus related delays and for increased costs associated with testing, cleaning, quarantine and immunization and certification.
COVID-19 continues to affect all operations and to impose risks and hardships for those charged with delivering the services that our communities rely upon us to perform.
The face of these challenges, it is gratifying to highlight that our vessels operated for 93% of the available operating days during the quarter, a testimony to the continued response of all of our employees in meeting the elevated operational challenges that we currently face.
Our businesses cannot function without the dedication of the individuals who bear the burden of ensuring its continued safe operation.
A particular note was work done in completing several planned out of service periods for drydock and surveys, work that is particularly challenging in a pandemic affected environment.
The sense of responsibility shared by OSG's mariners and shore-based support team in meeting the essential need to supply transportation fuel to the markets that we serve is commendable.
We are managing our operations, very much aware of the systems within which we operate are under stress with risks and vulnerabilities that have previously not affected our performance.
Although widely available vaccines appear to be a more reasonable expectation in the coming months, the bridge to normalcy will still require some work.
We are monitoring several legislative proposals that could present opportunities to recover some COVID-19 related costs or receive some assistance and adjusting to the disruptions caused by the continuing pandemic.
The prospect for further fiscal stimulus acting to accelerate demand is also of interest.
While we are not expecting any material impact on either our liquidity position or our financial results arising out of the application of already enacted provisions, we are hopeful that post-election developments will be more supportive.
Turning now to the impact of the virus on our conventional Jones Act trades.
It is becoming apparent that the glide path afforded us by the strong time charter book achieved at the end of last year, aided by the tailwinds of the successful completion of our ATC acquisition about to encounter some turbulence.
These factors have to date kept us largely immune from the pandemic related business shocks experienced by others.
Yet as we approach the end of what has been one of the most unusual years of our lifetimes is becoming more apparent that the demand destruction arising out of behavioral changes caused by the COVID pandemic is lingering longer than had been initially anticipated.
Our principal customers, U.S. based refiners and distributors continue to be heavily impacted by reduced levels of domestic transportation fuel demand, which having picked up in the summer months has sagged again as we have moved into the fall.
Ethylene consumption has retreated back to levels 10% to 12% below year ago norms, and jet fuel consumption remains about 50% below year ago levels.
The EIA statistics released this past week show refining operation capacity still below 70% in PADD one and just over 75% in PADD III.
Recovery of global oil demand is nearly four million barrels per day lower than expectations issued in early July.
In addition to flagging demand, middle distillate blood has been the biggest obstacle to the recovery of refining margins, increased output and improved crude demand.
That blood and weak middle distillate spreads have reduced refining margins, undermining crude demand and crude oil prices.
Refiners and distributors of transportation fuel have felt the sting of these energy market developments.
Layoffs at our principal customers are widespread.
Marathon and Shell, PBF and Phillips 66 have already or will soon reduce U.S. operating refining capacity.
Cost-cutting in the face of reduced demand, inflated inventories and poor refining margins is foremost in our customers' minds.
In these circumstances, we consider the pendulum of our customers' risk aversion as having swung to an extreme.
Focus is concentrated only on the immediate future with one outcome being the reluctance to commit a long-term time charters.
Notwithstanding these sobering data points, we and many analysts that we follow continue to see the demand shock as being virus codependent and that a sharp recovering on the back of a vaccine availability can be reasonably expected.
The timing of this recovery is to our mind the only material variable.
Independent of vaccine news, there has been an encouraging recent trend in inventory reductions across the board with notable continuing draws in both domestic crude oil and distillate stocks in recent weeks.
Even a gradual demand recovery in an environment of reduced inventories should positively impact chartering demand.
Our short-term forward planning takes this into consideration and anticipates a return of increased demand for time charter transportation capacity during the first half of next year.
As we have noted frequently in comments in past quarters, our principal end user base is vulnerable to any potential marine transportation supply shortage, as the marine length between production and distribution points is not easily replicated.
This is particularly true in the market for refined product distribution.
Obtaining the stability of cash flow offered by time charters and multiyear contracts of affreightment remains a fundamental objective of our chartering approach.
A material demand recovery in a supply constrained market should encourage our customer base to secure greater visibility of access to forward transportation capacity.
A return to normal in this context would be a favorable development in helping us achieve our long-term chartering objectives.
In awaiting this development and in response to the sharp curtailment of immediate activity by our customers, we have kept two of our Jones Act tankers and one lightering ATB currently trading as a conventional ATB in layup.
We consider it likely that at least one more vessel will enter layup prior to the end of this year.
At this time, we continue to maintain the operational availability of the Overseas Martinez for potential spot market moves.
Future developments and the demand for coast wide crude oil transportation will continue to feature the balancing of available supply in our conventional Jones Act trades.
As always, relative price of domestic versus international crudes remains a critical variable from our perspective.
Relative price differentials should not be looked at in isolation however.
International shipping rights also factor into the equation, looking at comparable delivery cost economics.
It bears repeating that although rates in the international markets act only indirectly on domestic market conditions, lower international rates have the marginal effect of creating more competition for our vessels when considering cargo movements on a delivered cost per barrel basis.
Before handing things over to Dick to take you through the numbers, I would like to note that our current fleet profile consists of three actively trading large crude oil tankers being operated by ATC, one conventional ATP, two lightering ATBs, three shuttle tankers, 10 MR tankers and two non-Jones Act MR tankers that participate in the U.S. Maritime security program.
OSG also currently owns and operates two Marshall Island Flags MR tankers, which trade internationally.
OSG has on order one Jones Act-compliant barge scheduled for delivery at the end of this month, which will be paired with one of our existing tugs.
A one-year time charter for this ATB has been secured upon its delivery.
We were pleased with our third quarter operating results, which were in line with our expectations.
Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA exceeds $104 million.
As is typical, the third quarter is a slow period, which this year was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thus, there were even fewer than usual spot cargo movements, and those were for ATBs.
The Overseas Long Beach was redelivered to us during the quarter and shortly thereafter, we performed our required drydocking and survey.
In recognition of the lack of spot market activity, we decided to play sure and layup.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, we had a significant amount of drydock activity this quarter.
We had 193 days in which we were offhire resulting in $9.9 million in lost revenues during the quarter.
In 2019's third quarter, there was no drydock activity.
Year-over-year, TCE revenue grew 21% to $92.3 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased 35% from $16.1 million to $21.8 million.
Sequentially, TCE revenues decreased $8.1 million.
Although dampened by our drydock activity, we continue to realize the positive impact of our fleet operating principally under time charters in an improved great environment.
We operated 24 vessels for the full third quarter of 2020 and 19 in the third quarter of 2019.
During the quarter, we sold the OSG 244, our final rebuilt barge for scrap.
RAGS, the tug formerly coupled with the OSG 244 has completed her drydock and is in Oregon awaiting the delivery of the OSG 205.
Since the third quarter of last year, we added the three Alaskan tankers as well as the Gulf Coast, Sun Coast, Key West and the OSG 204.
We did not operate any rebuild ATBs in the current quarter.
The Alaskan tanker acquisitions contributed $16.2 million in TCE revenues during their second full quarter of operations.
Revenues from our Jones Act Handysize tankers decreased $8.8 million.
The decrease was principally driven by lost revenue due to drydock related offhire days.
Also contributing were the layup of the Key West and very late in the quarter, the Long Beach.
Effective daily rate for fixed earnings increased over $3,900 per day from last year.
TCE revenues from our four non-Jones Act tankers increased $4.8 million from last year's quarter.
Gulf Coast and Sun Coast, both of which were on long-term time charters contributed $2.9 million of the increase.
We conducted two voyages for the government of Israel this year compared to one last year.
Revenue days approximately doubled in comparison to last year.
Effective day rates for fixed earnings increased slightly less than $3,000, while spot market rates were almost flat in comparison to last year.
ATB TCE revenues decreased by $0.9 million from 2019's third quarter.
The OSG 204 in its first full quarter of operations contributed all of the third quarter 2020 revenues.
Last year, two rebuilt ATBs operated in our third quarter.
Total revenue days decreased from 180 during last year's quarter to 146 in this year's quarter.
Lightering revenues decreased $2.8 million from the third quarter of 2019.
Both of our lightering ATBs were a drydock during the third quarter of 2020 for a combined 90-odd higher days.
Service demand continued to be lower than the prior year as refinery runs remained at reduced levels.
Effective day rates during the quarter increased from 2019.
Sequentially, TCE revenues decreased $8.1 million, principally due to a net $8.2 million increase in offhire lost revenues over the second quarter.
Jones Act Handysize tanker revenues decreased approximately $12.7 million.
The decline was driven by increased drydock related offhire days and to a lesser extent, the impact of the Key West and layup during the quarter.
Lightering ATBs and the non-Jones Act tankers all reflected increases in revenues when compared to the prior quarter.
Non-Jones Act tankers had additional revenue days as their drydocks were completed during Q2.
The ATB operations reflect the first quarter impact from the OSG 204.
Lightering revenues were low in the prior quarter due to reduced volumes.
The spread between fixed and spot earnings narrowed slightly as the portion of our fleet operating on time charters declined somewhat during the quarter due to both drydock activity and the redelivery of the Long Beach.
Conventional tankers spot market TCE revenues represented a de minimis portion of our total tanker revenues in the quarter.
The decrease in fixed revenues during the quarter were, as previously discussed driven by increased drydock offhire days.
We classify short-term time charters as spot market activity.
Our niche businesses continue to provide earnings stability, which serves to underpin our overall operations.
During the third quarter of 2020, lightering revenues increased for the reasons previously described.
During the quarter, both the OSG 350 and 351 went through required drydocking.
And during the time, when the OSG 351 was in the shipyard, the 350 operated in the Delaware Bay to meet our service commitments.
Non-Jones Act tanker revenues increased from both the prior year due to an increase in revenue days and Q3 2019 when we operated only two ships.
Shuttle tanker revenues were essentially flat from the prior quarters.
Vessel operating contribution, which is defined as TCE revenues less vessel operating expenses and charter higher expenses increased 34.5% from Q3 '19 to $26.5 million in the current quarter.
Our Alaskan tanker provided $6.2 million of the increase.
The Jones Act tanker loss increased $2.6 million from the year ago quarter, primarily due to drydock activity.
Our niche market contribution increased $1.7 million from last year as we added the Gulf Coast and Sun Coast to our fleet.
ATB vessel operating contribution during the quarter results solely from the introduction of the OSG 204 and her initial time charter, which commenced in early July.
We will take delivery of the OSG 205 later this month, at which time she will commence for initial time charter.
Sequentially, vessel operating contribution decreased $9.8 million from Q2 2020.
Contributing to the decrease was an $8 million increase in offhire lost revenues and the Key West layup.
This was partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in contribution from our Alaskan tankers.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased $5.7 million from 18 -- from $16.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 to $21.8 million.
The increase resulted from an increase in the number of vessels operated, including the Alaskan tankers, effective increased rates across the fleet and improved utilization due to the shift to time charters.
This was partially offset by 193 offhire days due to drydock activities in the current quarter compared to none last year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $21.8 million in the quarter compared to $29.8 million in the prior 2020 quarter.
Quarterly decrease was driven by the significant increase in lost higher revenues.
Net loss for the third quarter of 2020 was $700,000 compared to a net loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Operationally, the increased TCE Jones Act tanker revenues and new non-Jones Act tankers as well as the addition of the Alaskan tankers drove the reduction in net loss.
During each year, we perform scheduled maintenance as required by regulation.
Vessel maintenance requirements are based on the original construction date at intervals of approximately 2.5 years.
As a result, we have years in which the volume of drydock activities are substantially greater than other years.
This slide provides information for scheduled maintenance and ballast water treatment system installations.
It does not include unplanned repairs, which should they occur could impact the schedule.
While vessels are in drydock or otherwise unavailable for use, they are offhire even if otherwise employed on the time charter.
We work to minimize the number of offhire days to reduce the revenue loss we sustain.
This year because of COVID-19, estimating the timing of drydock activities on a quarterly basis has been particularly challenging.
Shipyards are deferring scheduled drydocks because of staffing issues related to COVID-19 lockdowns.
Technical personnel from third-party vendors necessary to accomplish certain aspects of the maintenance process have been and are unable to travel to repair locations.
This has resulted in a series of backlogs throughout the industry.
Slide presents our best estimates of the timing of drydock activity for the remainder of the year, which has changed from prior estimates.
It is possible that these estimates will continue to change as to timing.
We expect that although the timing may shift, the annual totals will remain reasonable estimates.
This comparative graphical detection of 2020 and 20,000 -- or 2019 drydock activities shows how active a drydock year 2020 is.
We estimate, which includes the three recently acquired Alaskan tankers that our investment will be $34.7 million in drydock expenses and $18.6 million for ballast water treatment systems in 2020.
We will experience approximately $19 million in lost revenue for the full year resulting from 392 offhire days.
Changes from prior quarter estimates result from both actual costs that were completed and timing differences.
In all cases, we endeavor to work through this process expeditiously to minimize the costs incurred in the number of days offhire.
As you can see, there were no drydock days in either the third or fourth quarters of 2019.
Our estimate is that in total, we will experience 266 offhire days in the second half of 2020 with a related revenue loss of approximately $14 million.
The OSG 205 is scheduled to deliver in late November.
We have invested through the end of the third quarter $45.9 million in the 205.
Remaining payments including those due on delivery total $5.1 million.
We have secured a financing commitment for the OSG 205, which we expect to close in the next two weeks.
We will capture approximately $28 million of our equity currently invested in the barge.
At the beginning of the third quarter, we had total cash of $94 million, which included $20.1 million of restricted cash.
During the third quarter of 2020, we generated $22 million of adjusted EBITDA and working capital provided another $3 million of cash.
We expended $11 million in dry docking and improvements to our vessels, and we invested $16 million in new vessel construction and other capex.
We expended $24 million of cash to fully repay the loan secured by the Overseas Gulf Coast.
$20 million of that was the previously restricted cash.
We incurred $5 million in interest expense and made debt repayments of $9 million.
Result was we ended the quarter with $54 million of cash, including $100,000 of restricted cash.
Continuing our discussion of cash and liquidity as we mentioned on the previous slide, we have $54 million of cash at September 30, 2020 including $100,000, which was restricted.
Our total debt was $412 million, and this represents a decrease of $34 million in outstanding indebtedness since the end of June.
Our $325 million term loan has an annual amortization requirement of $25 million or $6.25 million per quarter.
With $374 million of equity, our net debt-to-equity ratio is 1 times.
We do not expect any profit share obligation to AMSC in connection with our bareboat charters will be created in either 2020 or 2021.
Largely speaking, we can be pleased with the financial results achieved thus far in 2020.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we do anticipate that the turbulence experienced during the third quarter will likely pick up.
We will benefit from fewer planned dry docking days, and we anticipate improvement in our niche business performance.
We are thus anticipating TCE revenues of between $86 million and $90 million [Technical Issues].
These expectations aren't bad, then we will deliver a full year adjusted EBITDA of between $120 million and $125 million essentially at the high end of the full year guidance we provided in our first quarter earnings call.
Although our forward planning contemplates layup of several vessels in the immediate future, we consider the prospects for a sharp and robust demand recovery during the first half of next year to be a reasonable expectation, assuming continued progress on vaccines and other measures to contain the spread of the virus.
Although a restoration of jet fuel demand will likely lag other transportation fuels, a return of a healthy gasoline market spurred by stimulus and a return to more normalized levels of mobility is to be considered more likely than not.
Demand for crude oil marine movements domestically remain difficult to predict.
Price differentials, pipeline developments, refinery operating conditions and the politics all act to constantly modify the decision trees that ultimately influence crude price and production outcomes.
Current crude price differentials are at the low end of recent spreads and are not overly supportive of substituting international crews with domestic sources.
Conversely, if the multiple variables affecting refinery sourcing decisions shift to favor domestic over international crude purchases, additional crude transportation demand could serve to significantly tighten the market with favorable implications on employment prospects for our conventional tankers.
Above all, we take comfort in the strong contributions that we can expect next year from the ATC vessel on charter as well as the expected revenue streams from our niche businesses, in particular, our two active shuttle tankers in our existing MSP vessels.
We have extended our contract of affreightment with the government of Israel for another year in 2021 and have taken steps to enhance the utilization rates of all of our international trading tankers.
In 2021, we will have committed revenue streams for the full year from the OSG 204, OSG 205 and the ATC vessels that were only partially present during 2020.
These cash flow stabilizers coupled with our healthy levels of available liquidity provide confidence that we will ride out the short-term market weakness and carry through to what we believe to be fundamentally promising medium and long-term futures.
Challenges remain as new opportunities.
We have a strong balance sheet and a renewed fleet profile of assets, which has reduced the average age of our fleet substantially.
We continue to achieve lower costs and material improvements in our key safety and operational performance measures.
We are focused on achieving high health and safety performance in the COVID-19 environment.
While we foresee greater uncertainty in the immediate future, we remain confident in the long-term success of our business model and of OSG's ability to maintain its position as the leading U.S. flag vessel operator in the years to come.
