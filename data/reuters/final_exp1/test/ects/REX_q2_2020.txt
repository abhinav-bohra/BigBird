But first, I'll review the Safe Harbor disclosure.
As such, actual results may vary materially from expectations.
I have joining me on the call today, Stuart Rose, Executive Chairman of the Board, and Zafar Rizvi, Chief Executive Officer.
Sales for the quarter decreased 63% primarily due to lower production levels as we had idled our One Earth and NuGen ethanol plants in March.
We reopened the One Earth plant in late May and the NuGen plant in late June, which resulted in approximately one month of production for each of the plants in the second quarter.
Ethanol sales for the quarter were based upon 26.5 million gallons this year versus 60.4 million last year.
Sales for the quarter were also impacted by 11% decline on ethanol pricing year-over-year.
We reported a gross profit of $553,000 in the second quarter for the ethanol and by-products segment versus a gross profit of $6.2 million in the prior year.
The decrease in gross profit was primarily caused by the same factors that impacted sales.
Our refined coal segment had a gross loss of $1.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $2.2 million for the prior year, based upon lower volume.
These losses are offset by tax benefit of $2.9 million and $3.2 million for the second quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively, recorded from the Section 45 credits and the tax benefits from operating losses.
SG&A was similar between quarters at $4.4 million this year versus $4.8 million in the prior year.
We had a loss of $507,000 from our unconsolidated equity investment in this year's second quarter versus income of $239,000 in the prior year, reflecting overall ethanol industry conditions.
Interest and other income declined year-over-year from $1.3 million to $197,000, primarily due to lower interest rates on our cash and short-term investments as interest rates fell sharply during the current year.
We recorded a tax benefit of $4.1 million for the second quarter of this year versus $2.6 million in the prior year.
We recorded our federal tax benefit from currently calculated tax losses at 35% rather than the current 21% tax rate based upon our ability to carry back losses five years due to the CARES Act.
These factors led to a net loss attributable to REX shareholders of $1.7 million in the current-year second quarter versus net income of $2.3 million in the prior year.
Going forward, ethanol is currently profitable with our plants open.
The ethanol prices are low -- or excuse me, are up over last quarter.
Corn appears to be plentiful with hopefully a good harvest in sight.
The only negative that we see -- or that I see is, at this current time, the biggest negative I see is, there is 98 refineries that have applied for RIN exemptions.
And if they were given all 98, that would have an impact on our business.
Or, if the government does not follow the law, RINs could have an impact on our business.
In terms of cash, we had over $180 million on a consolidated basis.
We continue to work on our potential carbon capture site, which Zafar Rizvi, our CEO, will discuss a little later.
We bought back 30,536 shares during the last quarter.
We're authorized to buy another 241,185, which we will again, work on if the stock dips -- or dips to levels that we think are attractive for the company to be buying back the stock.
We continue looking for quality ethanol plants at reasonable prices.
We've not found anything and nothing's imminent there.
We continue to look at ancillary products that can be made out of ethanol or its byproducts.
We would still consider an investment in something other than ethanol that could use our abilities.
But again, nothing is imminent in that area.
Zafar Rizvi, our CEO, will now discuss further our ethanol business and carbon capture.
As we all note, 2020 fiscal year started in a challenging environment, including a decline in the crude and ethanol demand price, COVID-19 pandemic and shut down of business and stay-at-home orders by government.
That resulted in a decrease in the fuel demand and negatively impacted the ethanol industry.
Several ethanol facilities across the country were shut down, including both of our majority-owned plants.
As I mentioned in the first quarter call, that challenging environment led to decision to shut down the NuGen plant on March 17 and One Earth at March 31.
By April 2020, we had idled both of our majority-owned plants.
We have experienced some improvements in business activity at late May as COVID-19 shutdown order relaxed.
That created increase in demand for the gasoline and ethanol.
As the demand of ethanol increased, that led to reopening of One Earth Energy in late May and NuGen Energy in late June.
Since One Earth Energy's second quarter ended on June 30 and NuGen's second quarter ended on July 31, due to that reason, second quarter financial results have approximately one month of production activities for each location.
We also gone through usual restart-up production problem, but these problems are behind us now.
We have seen further improvements so far in third quarter and steady flow of corn at both of our majority-owned locations and improved crush margin.
We believe this could lead to a profitable third quarter provided economic condition, crush margin, availability of corn continues to improve and COVID-19 threat further reduced.
USDA corn progress report shows 64% of the corn is excellent to good condition compared to 57% last year.
The corn condition in South Dakota where our ethanol plant, Marion is -- ethanol plant NuGen is located, is 74% excellent to good compared to 63% last year as per USDA report on August 24.
The corn crops around our plants' draw area in South Dakota and Illinois looks better than last year, which could lead to a better yield, early harvest and better future economic results.
But on the other hand, as Stuart mentioned earlier, we are still experiencing continued uncertainty because of the trade disputes and COVID-19 threat and the small refinery exemption.
The EPA continued to consider and grant small refinery exemption from RFS compliance here, which could lead to a less blending of ethanol and could lead to a less demand of ethanol.
The ethanol and DDG export dropped in first six months of 2020.
Compared to last year, the ethanol export totaled 731 million gallons compared 764 million gallons during the same period last year.
Export of dry distiller grain through June of 2020 also approximately 5 million tons compared to 5.36 metric tons for the first six months of 2019.
Let me give you -- also give you some progress on the carbon sequestration project, which I discussed in our previous call.
As I mentioned during the previous call, we are working with the University of Illinois to explore carbon sequestration project.
The university has received a US Department of Energy award through the carbon safe programs and expect it to start work within a couple of months to develop carbon storage site associated with One Earth Energy ethanol facility.
The University of Illinois will be drilling a test well, performing seismic test service, contact front-end engineering and design, and study of the CO2 capture system.
As I mentioned during the previous call, geological mapping, characterization and modeling have demonstrated that excellent storage potential exists in the Mt. Simon storage complex in the vicinity of One Earth Energy facility.
To date, we have completed the feasibility study, seismic testing and have purchased extra land for this project.
This project is still at preliminary stage, and we cannot predict we will be successful with this project.
In summary, we have some -- we have seen some improvements of crush margin and expect better corn crops in our dry area this year.
And that -- than last year, that could lead to a profitable third quarter.
I will give back -- give the floor back to Stuart Rose for his further comments.
In conclusion, it looks like the worst is behind us.
The ethanol business is now currently profitable.
We have great plants, great locations, among the best in the industry.
Most important, we have great people, and that's the biggest thing that allowed us to navigate this difficult time and become profitable again.
I'll now leave it open to questions.
