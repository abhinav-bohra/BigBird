Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases.
The past 15 months have further showcased the resiliency of our industries as well as our ability to communicate and manage appropriately to serve growing consumer and customer demand.
2021 is off to a strong start with comparable diluted earnings per share up 18%, comparable operating earnings up 12% and global beverage volumes up 8%, despite a couple of disruptions in North and Central America beverage and aerospace that were outside of our control.
Our cups team executing national distribution of the Ball Aluminum Cup at seven out of the 10 largest U.S. food and beverage retailers late in the quarter.
Our aerospace team continued to successfully test key instruments and win NASA contracts and study programs, and our businesses hired nearly 1,000 people net in the quarter to support our long-term growth.
As many know, and you will hear us speak endlessly about, aluminum beverage cans already contain, on average, more than 70% recycled content, which is multiples above any other beverage package.

In addition to global beverage volumes being up 8%, specialty mix increased above 49%, up from 46% at year-end 2020.
Our global engineering and operations teams are executing at a high level and we anticipate exiting 2021 with an additional 12 billion units of new installed capacity, all of which underscores our Investor Day commentary: cans are in high demand, contracts are in place and Ball is well on its way to installing at least 25 billion units of global capacity by year-end 2023.
That's off of a base of 100 billion in 2019.
As John mentioned, we have hired an additional 1,000 colleagues year-to-date, with the majority of them located in the United States.
Given market characteristics and our project execution, I'm very positive about our ability to achieve our goals and deliver low double-digit global volume growth and global specialty mix in excess of 50% in 2021.
We continue to see the global industry growing at an annual rate in excess of 6% for the foreseeable future.
As a reminder, for those of you newer to the industry, that is two times the historical CAGR and puts the industry on track to grow at least 100 billion units by 2025.
Ball is well positioned to capture at least 45 billion units of that growth given our scale and innovation in the world's largest can markets.
In North America, beverage first quarter volumes were up 6% and specialty mix improved to 37%.
As we have discussed on prior calls, given three plants coming online in North America, full year start-up costs are expected to be in the range of $50 million.
In EMEA, segment volume for the first quarter was up 5% and specialty mix was 54%.
In South America, first quarter volumes were up 14% and specialty mix increased to nearly 68%, despite only 80% to 85% of delivery channels being open during the recent resurgence of the virus.
Comparable first quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share were $0.72 versus $0.61 in 2020, an increase of 18%.
Our full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings will now be in the range of 18%.
Full year interest expense will be in the range of $275 million.
And full year corporate undistributed costs recorded in other nonreportable are now expected to be in the range of $90 million.
We continue to see a path to doubling our cash from operations by 2025.
We expect 2021 total capex to exceed $1.5 billion and returns on capital beyond our 9% after-tax hurdle rate will follow through as new growth capital products become operational later in the year and in the years to come.
In summary, our Drive for 10 vision serves us very well, whether it be broadening our geographic expansion developing new customers, markets and products and doing so with a commitment to being close to our customers and with uncompromising integrity.
Following our strong first quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are even better positioned to exceed our comparable diluted earnings per share long-term goal of 10% to 15% and exceed our EVA dollar growth goals of 4% to 8% per year in 2021 and beyond.
