Major highlights for the year include assembling a new management team with deep franchising expertise, a reorganization of our business to focus on our brands; the elimination of 1,356 company-owned salons through refranchising, negotiated lease buyouts or closing at the end of the lease terms; a new organizational structure based on zero-based budgeting, the transition of almost 2,000 salons onto our proprietary POS and salon management system, OpenSalon Pro, and the rollout of individual bonus defining KPIs across the organization to create a performance-driven culture.
But perhaps even more telling is that salon hours work is down 25% versus pre-pandemic levels, causing a slower sales recovery than we would have liked to see.
From a geography perspective, in our largest brand, Supercuts, states such as Florida, Oklahoma, Alabama and Arizona have been able to improve labor hours by 5 to 10 points versus the rest of our fleet, resulting in these states which were posting sales 10 points short of pre-COVID levels in Q4, almost touching pre-COVID comps as we moved into July.
This, combined with close to 100 years of Regis operating history, is a differentiator from other franchisors.
As of today, only about 200 company-owned salons are left in our portfolio.
The pipeline of remaining venditions is set to get this figure down to under 130 corporate salons by the end of this calendar year, making the transition essentially complete.
We have conducted a robust 6-month assessment of our people and cost structure, and these changes are a major component of the plan to bring Regis back on to a path of growth and profitability.
We now have just under 1,900 salons live on OSP, with another 200 contracts to install the system in the coming weeks.
On a consolidated basis, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $99 million versus $60 million in the prior year, which was 65% higher as the majority of our salons were closed in the fourth quarter of last year.
Core royalties and fee revenue increased 263% from Q4 of 2020 from $7 million to $27 million.
The only significant shutdowns in Q4 were in Canada, where approximately 300 salons were closed, impacting our overall revenue by approximately 5%.
As we look at some of the states and regions negatively impacting our comp, particularly California and the Northeast, which are returning to normalcy more slowly, we are seeing 10% to 20% increases in nominal revenue per store since the beginning of Q4, which means they are growing, they are just behind the curve.
Overall, with the direct correlation between labor hour performance and sales performance that Felipe mentioned and 75% of our stores running well below pre-COVID levels from a labor hour perspective, we remain unclear to the exact timing of staffing levels returning to pre-COVID levels.
We reported an operating loss of $27 million during the quarter, which includes a $5 million noncash inventory reserve charge associated with the change in our merchandising strategy.
Fourth quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA loss of $23 million compared to a $34 million adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 as we are lapping the closure of our fleet last year.
It's worth noting that this quarter's adjusted EBITDA includes $13 million of losses related to our company-owned salon portfolio that will be dramatically reduced as we exit these salons.
Looking at the segment-specific performance and starting with our franchise segment, I mentioned fourth quarter royalties and fees increased $19 million versus the same quarter last year, primarily due to the government-mandated shutdowns last year.
Fourth quarter franchise adjusted EBITDA was $11 million, an increase of $10 million year over year, driven by increased sales and increased salon comps.
In our company-owned salon segment, fourth quarter revenue was $25 million, an increase of $10 million or 65% versus the prior year.
Company-owned salon segment adjusted EBITDA increased $9 million year over year to a loss of $13 million versus a loss of $22 million, primarily due to the shutdown last year.
As it relates to corporate overhead, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA loss of $21 million increased $8 million year over year, compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of $14 million in the prior year.
Upon the successful execution of our zero-based budgeting, we expect G&A excluding rent to be in the range of $72 million to $80 million annually, which not only represents G&A for our franchisor structure, but also G&A for our full technology company that developed, supports and maintains OpenSalon Pro.
Had we continued to operate as is, our wholesale product business would have lost $2 million to $3 million in fiscal year '22.
As of June 30, we had $129 million of liquidity, including $89 million of available revolver capacity and $19 million of cash.
Our net available liquidity as of June 30 was $54 million, which reflects our minimum liquidity covenant requirements and the permitted add-back of the shortfall in certain refranchising proceeds in accordance with our amended credit facility.
