In the quarter, our hospitals provided care to 27,000 COVID-19 patients, approximately 5% of total admissions.
This level is significantly below third quarter's 13%.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have provided inpatient care to over 260,000 patients who contracted the virus.
Same-facility revenues grew 6.4% in the quarter as compared to prior year.
Inpatient revenue grew 2% and outpatient revenue grew 13%.
Same-facility volumes increased on a year-over-year basis across most major categories with the exception of inpatient surgeries, which were down 1%.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, increased 7% to $4.42 in the quarter.
As I indicated previously, we believe demand for healthcare services will be strong in 2022 and comparable to historical growth rates in the 2% to 3% zone with COVID-related admissions representing between 3% and 5% of total.
Over the past year, we have increased the ambulatory care sites in our networks by 14%, bringing the total number to approximately 2,200.
These sites support the 182 hospitals we operate today and will provide support in the future to the eight new hospitals we recently announced in various Texas and Florida markets.
Our cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion as compared to a use of cash of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In the prior year quarter, cash flow was affected by our returning or repaying early approximately $6 billion of CARES Act funding.
For full year 2021, cash flow from operations was just under $9 billion.
Capital spending was $1.2 billion for the quarter and was $3.6 billion for the full year 2021.
In addition, we have approximately $4.1 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online over the next three years.
We completed just over $2 billion of share repurchases during the quarter and $8.2 billion for the full year.
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times at the end of the third quarter, and we had approximately $3.6 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter.
For full year 2021, we realized approximately $2.2 billion in proceeds from sales of facilities and healthcare entities and recognized approximately $1.6 billion in gains on these sales.
We also executed on $1.1 billion of acquisitions on healthcare entities during the year.
We expect revenue to range between $60 billion and $62 billion.
We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $5.55 billion and $5.835 billion.
We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range between $12.55 billion and $13.05 billion.
We expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $18.40 and $19.20, and we expect capital spending to approximate $4.2 billion during the year.
The midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $12.8 billion reflects a 1.2% increase over our 2021 adjusted EBITDA.
In 2021, we recognized approximately $900 million in COVID support from the DRG add-ons, HRSA reimbursement for uninsured COVID patients and the impact of the delay in sequestration cuts.
We do not have full line of sight into all of these programs for the full year, but we do expect some benefit continuing, and our guidance anticipates approximately $150 million of support in 2022.
In addition, our divestitures contributed about $140 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2021.
When you consider these items, along with an estimate of about $300 million of incremental cost for serving COVID patients in 2021, our growth in adjusted EBITDA is consistent with our historical expectations for growth over time of 4% to 6%.
Within guidance, we expect our same-facility admissions to grow approximately 2% to 3% while revenue per admission to grow approximately 1%.
We anticipate adjusted EBITDA margin to range between 20% and 21% for the full year.
Depreciation is estimated to be about $3 billion, and interest expense is projected to be around $1.7 billion.
Finally, our fully diluted shares are expected to be about 303 million for the full year.
Cash flow from operations is estimated to range between $9 billion and $9.5 billion.
