Third quarter adjusted earnings were $2.45 per share.
With good visibility into the rest of the year, we are narrowing our 2021 guidance range and $5.90 through $6.10 per share and expect to achieve 2022 and 2023 results in line with our outlooks.
And despite $65 million of nonfuel revenue losses in the third quarter due to Hurricane Ida, we are maintaining our financial commitments.
We gathered a restoration force of 27,000, our largest ever, representing Entergy employees, contractors and mutual assistance crews from 41 states across the country.
Metro areas like New Orleans and Baton Rouge saw restoration essentially completed by day 10.
Within three weeks, more than 98% of all affected customers were restored.
Entergy also helped our customers and communities throughout the recovery process by developing -- or deploying 165 commercial scale generators to power critical community infrastructure like medical facilities, gas stations, grocery stores, municipal water systems and community cooling centers in advance of power being restored.
In addition to restoration work, Entergy's employees contributed countless hours to their communities and Entergy shareholders committed $1.25 million to help affected communities rebuild and recover.
Entergy has made significant transmission and distribution investments, nearly $10 billion over the last five years, which made our system more resilient.
Hurricane Laura made landfall as the strongest storm to hit the Louisiana Coast since 1856.
Then exactly 12 months later, Hurricane Ida hit with almost equal force.
Even prior to Ida, we are actively deploying multiple options along the resiliency scale, particularly for our service areas south of I-10 and I-12, which has the greatest exposure to hurricane-strength winds and flooding.
We've announced five gigawatts of solar in our supply plan through 2030 with a goal of doing more.
While many have expressed long-term goals like net-zero by 2050, even more have developed shorter-term interim goals that will require action by the end of the decade.
Over the next three years, we have a $12 billion capital plan that is designed to deliver reliability, resilience and improve customer experience and environmental and cost efficiency benefits to our customers.
Summarized on Slide five, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.45, slightly higher than a year ago.
In fact, with three quarters of the year behind us, we are narrowing our guidance range to $5.90 to $6.10.
Industrial billed sales were 10% stronger than a year ago.
Overall, across all classes, we estimate that third quarter revenues were approximately $65 million lower as a result of Ida.
The quarter's result is about $300 million higher than last year.
I'll take a minute to discuss our balance sheet, beginning with a quick update on Hurricane Ida on Slide 10.
Over the past several weeks, we've refined our cost estimates, and we've shaved $100 million off the upper end of the range.
The total cost is now expected to be $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion.
We've also updated our estimate of the nonfuel revenue loss to $75 million to $80 million, the lower half of our previous range.
While our net liquidity, including storm reserves remained strong at $4 billion, we are also working to ensure timely storm cost recovery.
First, Entergy Louisiana amended its 2020 storm filing to request an additional $1 billion to provide early liquidity for Hurricane Ida costs.
Combined with our ATM transactions, our future equity need is more than 50% lower than the $2.5 billion communicated at Analyst Day last year.
Moving to Slide 11.
In this case, for 2021 to $5.90 to $6.10.
Our Board of Directors recently declared a $0.06 increase in our quarterly common dividend, which is now $1.01 per share.
