On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 27.5%.
And generally, we are seeing a continued gradual capacity improvement at both academic and diagnostic labs, which we estimate between 90% and 95% of pre-COVID levels.

Before moving on, I would like to highlight the broad legal settlement with 10 times Genomics announced earlier this week.
This settlement resolves the multiyear global litigation with 10 times over outstanding issues in the field of single cell and includes a global cross-license agreement.
We estimate that the future royalty payments from this legal settlement could total $110 million to $140 million over the life of the agreement, which runs through the year 2030.
This includes payments of $32 million in the third quarter for back royalties owed to Bio-Rad for the period from November 2018 through December 2020 as well as for settlement fees and interests.
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics group in the second quarter were $380.2 million compared to $283.2 million in Q2 of 2020, which is a 34.3% increase on a reported basis and a 28% increase on a currency-neutral basis.
The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2021 was 56.1% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.6% in Q2 of 2020.

Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $1.3 million primarily due to foreign exchange and compared to $10.7 million of income last year.
Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July.

The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 17.4% on a GAAP basis to 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis.
This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2020 of 11.8%.

Excluding COVID-related sales, the non-GAAP year-over-year currency-neutral sales growth in the second half is expected to be between 13% and 14%.
