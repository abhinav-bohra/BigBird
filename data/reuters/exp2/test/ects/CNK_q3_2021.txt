This favorable progress was demonstrated in our third quarter's 61% growth in worldwide attendance since last quarter in 2Q '21.
Importantly, that growth in attendance flowed through to our bottom line results in the third quarter, which included positive adjusted EBITDA of $44 million.
Strength in the domestic box office was a key driver of our third quarter performance, as the North America industry delivered $1.4 billion of gross proceeds on a larger volume of more sizable commercial releases.
And consistent with last quarter, I'm thrilled to report that Cinemark once again over-indexed the North America industry box office performance relative to 3Q '19 with a substantial outperformance of 700 basis points.
This outperformance helped us capture an approximate 15% market share of North America box office, which significantly exceeded our historic average of just under 13%.
Our 15% market share achievement is particularly meaningful this quarter as the vast majority of theaters in the U.S. and Canada had reopened.
Driven by vaccine penetration to date as well as impacts from the virus beginning to subside, COVID rates have plunged 73% since the Delta variant peaked in September.
While the Delta variant threw us a curve ball during the third quarter and caused a meaningful dip in consumer comfort regarding visiting theaters, that sentiment has since recovered to 77% of U.S. moviegoers expressing comfort and going to the theater in the current environment.
This level of positive response is in line with the peak levels of sentiment we witnessed in early July of 78%.
Currently, 100% of our theaters have reopened across the region, and even though certain capacity and operating hour restrictions persist in Central and South America, consumer demand to return to the theaters is very strong.
During the third quarter, we completed billing reactivation on all Movie Club accounts that were proactively paused for the past 1.5 years during the pandemic.
In doing so, we have been extremely pleased by the minimal amount of churn we've experienced, which represented only a modest 6% dip in our pre-pandemic membership base that was largely driven by credit cards that expired during that timeframe.
Since we announced the launch of Movie Club Platinum just over a month ago, 64% of Movie Club members familiar with the program stated that they have been incentivized to achieve Platinum status this year.
We're also continuing to reap benefits from investments we've made in premium amenities that enrich the moviegoing experience, which movie fans continue to seek out, including reclining seats with approximately 65% of our entire domestic circuit featuring country loungers, the highest recliner penetration among the major theater operators.
Premium large-format auditoriums led by our XD, our proprietary brand, which ranks number one in the world, which delivered 12% of our box office in the third quarter alone on only 4% of our screens and an increase in D-Box motion seats, which are synchronized with the on-screen action.
Speaking of new theaters, strategic new-builds are a cornerstone of our strategy, and we are thrilled to have opened six new theaters and 67 screens already this year, all of which were committed to prior to the onset of COVID.
It has been an honor serving as CEO and leading the incredible people of Cinemark the past 6.5 years.
You've been a tremendous leader for our company and our industry over the past 6.5 years.
During 3Q, our average monthly cash burn reduced to approximately $11 million after normalizing for working capital timing.
This rate was in line with the expectation of a $10 million to $15 million monthly cash burn that we communicated on our last earnings call.
At the end of the third quarter, we had a global cash balance of $543 million.
As of October 31, that balance had increased to approximately $595 million, driven by the strong box office results of Venom: Let There Be Carnage, No Time To Die, Halloween Kills and Dune as well as working capital timing associated with corresponding film rental payments.
That said, multiple financing opportunities still remain available to us, including drawing on our $100 million revolving credit line, tapping incremental term loan borrowing capacity within our credit facility, executing sale-leaseback arrangements on unencumbered properties we own and issuing equity.
Also, as we described last quarter, following our recent refinancing transactions, our revolver maturity now sits at November of 2024 and all other significant debt maturities extend through March of 2025 and beyond.
Compared to second quarter, our third quarter domestic operating hours expanded by nearly 40%, although still remained approximately 25% below 3Q '19.
Expanded hours and increased moviegoing led to quarter-over-quarter domestic attendance growth of 42.4% to 21.5 million patrons.
Domestic admissions revenues were $195.3 million with an average ticket price of $9.08.
Our average ticket price increased 14.1% versus 3Q '19, primarily as a result of price increases and ticket type mix largely on account of fewer matinee and weekday showtimes.
Domestic concessions revenues were $142.6 million and yielded another all-time high food and beverage per cap of $6.63.
Our third quarter per cap was roughly flat with 2Q accrued 27% compared to 3Q '19 as pent-up moviegoing demand continues to drive a heightened indulgence in food and beverage consumption across our core concession categories and operating hours remain concentrated in timeframes that are more conducive to concession purchases.
Domestic other revenues also continued to rebound during the quarter and grew 28.3% to $37.6 million, driven by volume-related increases in screen ads, transaction fees and promotional income.
Altogether, third quarter total domestic revenues were $375.5 million, with positive adjusted EBITDA of $44.8 million.
Driven by expanded theater openings and increased availability of new film -- new commercial film content, our third quarter international attendance grew 128% versus 2Q '21 to 9.2 million patrons, which generated $30.2 million of admissions revenues and $21.6 million in concession revenues.
Total international revenues were $59.3 million and yielded adjusted EBITDA that was just shy of breaking even for the quarter.
Globally, film rental and advertising expenses were 51.9% of admissions revenues, which increased 200 basis points compared to 2Q '21.
That said, compared to the third quarter of 2019, our film rental rate was still down 420 basis points, predominantly due to reduced film grosses as skew lower on our film rental scales.
Concession costs were 17.2% of concessions revenues and were in line with both our second quarter results and pre-COVID averages.
Third quarter global salaries and wages were $67.6 million and increased 34.1% versus 2Q '21.
Facility lease expenses were $68.8 million, and while largely fixed, experienced a modest uptick from the second quarter due to a slight increase in percentage rent in common area maintenance as volumes increased.
Worldwide utilities and other expenses were $81.8 million and increased 33.7% quarter-over-quarter, driven by variable costs that grew in line with volume, such as credit card fees, janitorial expenses and commissions paid to third-party ticket sellers.
Finally, G&A for the quarter was $38.6 million and remained considerably lower than pre-pandemic levels as a result of the restructuring actions we pursued in the second quarter of 2020 and our ongoing efforts to minimize nonessential operating expenditures.
Collectively, our worldwide adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was positive $44.3 million.
Our net loss also materially improved in 3Q to $77.8 million, reducing by $64.7 million quarter-over-quarter.
Capital expenditures during the quarter were $24.4 million, of which $13.6 million was associated with new-build projects that had been committed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and $10.8 million was driven by investments and maintenance in our existing theaters.
As such, we continue to anticipate spending a highly reduced level of capex in 2021 relative to pre-pandemic ranges, which we previously estimated at approximately $100 million.
However, due to varied supply chain constraints that have started impacting the delivery timing of certain equipment and supplies, we now anticipate capex may come in slightly below $100 million for the full year.
