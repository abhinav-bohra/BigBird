Additional information concerning risk factors and cautionary statements are available in our most recent SEC filings and most recent company 10-K.
We have a proven business model that we believe is capable of managing through this extraordinary period and along with our proven 3-pillar strategy that continues to position us well for whatever challenges we find in fiscal 2021.
Q4 was a strong finish to the year, including revenue up 4.6% on an organic basis.
Our e-comm business grew over 60% in the quarter as we benefited from consumers shifting to online purchasing.
Notably, our consumption growth was about 7%, driven by these factors for the quarter after previously trending at about 2% prior to March, which was consistent with our expectations for the year.
Adjusted gross margin of 59.4% was up 200 basis points versus the prior year, primarily as a result of higher volume and geographic mix.
For Q1, we expect margins similar to prior quarters of about 58% as we expect a more normalized mix.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 per share was also up meaningfully, increasing approximately 14% versus the prior year as we benefited from higher sales growth, gross margin favorability and a reduction in interest expense and share count.
Free cash flow was $52.5 million in the quarter and continued to benefit from our industry-leading EBITDA margins, efficient capital spending and low cash tax rate.
For the full year fiscal 2020, our organic net revenues increased 1.3% versus the prior year, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and the divestiture of our Household Cleaning segment in the prior year.
Similar to Q4, our full year benefited from strong international segment growth, which was up over 15% versus the prior year when excluding foreign exchange.
E-commerce also grew rapidly, increasing approximately 50% for the full fiscal year and now accounts for approximately 5% of our net sales.
Adjusted earnings per share of $2.96 per share increased 6.5%, benefiting from our continued efforts to delever and opportunistically execute share buybacks.
Full year fiscal 2020 net revenues decreased slightly to $963 million but as mentioned on the prior slide, increased 1.3% on an organic basis after excluding foreign currency and the divestiture of Household Cleaning.
Adjusted gross margin, which excludes transition costs associated with our new logistics provider, was 58.3% for the full year, up 130 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by mix associated with strong international growth and the divestiture of Household Cleaning.
In terms of A&P, we came in at 16% of revenue in Q4 and 15.3% for the fiscal year.
For Q1, we would expect A&P to be below the fiscal 20% of sales as marketing plans are being adjusted in response to the current situation, resulting in A&P spending moving to future quarters.
Our G&A spending was just over 9% for the year, up slightly in dollars year-over-year.
In Q1, we would expect G&A to be about $22 million.
Finally, we reported adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 of $2.96, representing an increase of 6.5% versus the prior year, primarily driven by the effects of debt paydown and share repurchases.
We expect to continue to reduce debt outstanding, and as a result, we anticipate approximately $22 million of interest expense in Q1.
In Q4, we generated $52.5 million in adjusted free cash flow, which resulted in a full year adjusted free cash flow of $206.8 million.
This represents 2% growth versus the prior year despite the sale of the Household Cleaning business.
We continue to maintain industry-leading free cash flow with fiscal 2020 free cash flow conversion coming in at 136%.
At March 31, we finished the year with approximately $1.6 billion in net debt and a leverage ratio of 4.7 times.
During the year, we continued our focus on debt reduction and reduced net debt by $135 million.
We also repurchased approximately $57 million in shares opportunistically during the year, enabled by our strong cash generation.
In addition, we proactively built our liquidity position to strengthen our balance sheet, ending the year with approximately $95 million in cash.
And third, we have material cushion to our debt covenants, which are detailed in our 10-K.
As Chris highlighted, we generated $207 million in free cash flow, driven by strong EBITDA margin and low cash taxes.
Importantly, we continued to focus on debt reduction, reducing our leverage to within our long-term targeted range of 3.5 to five times.
We also used roughly 1/4 of our free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock.
This 3-pillar strategy is highly adaptable and will be our guide as we approach fiscal 2021.
Turning to slide 12, you can see the ways we expect to do this.
We believe our proven 3-pillar strategy and the building blocks shown here position us for success as we navigate this pandemic.
Let's dive in on each of these in more detail beginning on slide 13.
Our number one brands represent over 2/3 of our sales, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide and is a strength in the current environment.
We launched this tribute by donating 100,000 bottles of Clear Eyes to hard-hit hospitals New York City.
As an example, in the month of March alone, we saw an increase of 186% in new visitors browsing Prestige products in certain e-commerce retailers.
Moving ahead, we could see this channel representing as much as 8% or more of our total sales in fiscal 2021.
We finished the year with over $205 million in cash flow and a mid-30s EBITDA margin.
Let's wrap up on slide 20 and recap what we've just discussed.
But as of today, we anticipate Q1 revenues of $220 million or more.
We also anticipate earnings per share of $0.70 or more for Q1 as our proactive expense management and cost timing are expected to more than offset the anticipated revenue decline as compared to the prior year.
