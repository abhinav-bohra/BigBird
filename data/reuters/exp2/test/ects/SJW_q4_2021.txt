Fourth quarter revenue was $139.7 million, a $4 million increase over reported fourth quarter 2020 revenue.
Net income for the quarter was $18 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
This compares with net income of $13.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily driven by cumulative rate increases of $0.34 per share, decreased production cost due to lower customer usage of $0.30 per share, the sale of nonutility property of $0.29 per share, and recognition of the impact of our California Water Conservation Memorandum Account, or our WCMA, of $0.12 per share.
These increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.40 per share, an increase in per unit production cost of $0.20 per share and the impairment of a long-lived asset of $0.09 per share.
In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $0.14 per share related to flow-through items and the impact of such items on lower fourth quarter pre-tax earnings.
The $4 million increase in revenue was primarily due to $10 million in cumulative rate increases and $3.4 million in the recognition of balancing and memorandum accounts in California, which includes $3.2 million attributable to the WCMA.
These increases were partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease in customer usage.
Our Connecticut utility will benefit from an increase in our annual revenue requirement by approximately $9.9 million beginning January of 2022.

The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15%, compared to net negative 7% for the fourth quarter of 2020.

In addition, various regulatory mechanisms and balancing and memorandum accounts added $0.21 per share, and the recognition of the California WCMA contributed $0.12 per share.
These increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.93 per share, a production cost price increase of $0.44 per share, and an increase in administrative and general expenses of $0.25 per share.
In addition, depreciation expense increased $0.20 per share.
California surface water production resulted in a decrease of $0.15 per share and the long-lived asset impairment in Texas decreased earnings by $0.08 per share.
The 2021 increase in revenue was primarily due to $25.2 million in cumulative rate increases, $2.5 million in the net recognition of certain regulatory mechanisms in Connecticut and Maine, and $3.9 million in the recognition of balancing and memorandum accounts in California, including $3.2 million attributable to the WCMA, and $2.9 million in revenue from new customers.
These increases were partially offset by $24.7 million in decreased customer usage.
Water production expenses increased $3.3 million in 2021.
The increase was primarily due to $11 million -- $11.6 million in higher average per unit water production cost, $3.9 million due to a decrease in surface water supply production, and a $1.3 million increase in California cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts.
These increases were partially offset by $13.5 million in lower customer water usage.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in collections of previously billed and accrued receivables of $13 million, an increase in general working capital and net income adjusted for noncash items of $6.8 million and a $5.2 million decrease in the payment of amounts previously invoiced and accrued due to lower fourth quarter activity.
In addition, in 2020, we made a $5 million upfront service payment related to a concession agreement amendment that did not recur in 2021.
These increases were partially offset by an increase in the crude water production costs of $4 million.
