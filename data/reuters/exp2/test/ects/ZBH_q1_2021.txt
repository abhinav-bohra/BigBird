We've said before, we'll say it again that the spin-off of NewCo actually serves to de-risk and potentially accelerate our path to mid-single-digit growth and a best-in-class 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023 and we're confident that throughout this process and as we achieve this growth in margin profile, we're also going to have the flexibility to reinvest for growth and that is a key thing for us.
That's the ZB brand that we're looking for, that brand evolution of this company and I can tell you that already, more than 70% of our product development dollars are being spent in this area, being spent on ZB edge, that ecosystem of connected technologies.
Net sales in the first quarter were $1.847 billion, a reported increase of 3.6% and a constant currency increase of 80 basis points versus the same period in 2020.

Finally, our other category was down 2.5%.
In the first quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.71.
Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $2.46 last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was up about 60 basis points driven by higher revenues, with operating margins down slightly compared to 2020 and a higher share count.
The adjusted tax rate of 16% in the quarter was better-than-expected, driven by the realization of excess stock compensation benefit and other smaller discrete items.
Overall, operating cash flows were $247 million and free cash flow totaled $137 million for the first quarter.
We paid down an additional $200 million of debt and ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $724 million.

Adjusted operating profit margins of 26.5% to 27.5%, an adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.50 to $8 and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion.
Net interest expense is expected to step up about 5% versus 2020, and we expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 211 million shares for the full year.
We continue to expect our structural organic revenue growth rate to accelerate to the mid-single-digit range, with adjusted operating margins of at least 30% as we exit 2023.
