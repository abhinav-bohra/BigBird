Senior Lifestyle's total orderly rental obligation to LTC is approximately $4.6 million.
For the quarter ended June 30th, 2020, we received a total of approximately $1.8 million.
In July, we received approximately $1.1 million.
While recent rent payments have been trending up, at June 30th, Senior Lifestyle owed us $2.8 million for the second quarter of 2020, which is reflected in our receivable balance as of that date and is covered by an undrawn letter of credit that we hold.
In cooperation with Senior Lifestyle, we are evaluating our options for the portfolio, which may include seeking new operators for the 23 properties and/or pursuing sales of some of the 23.
Our current Senior Lifestyle is one of only two operators where income and asset concentration exceeds 10%.
Primarily due to this write-off, total revenues decreased $17.8 million from last year's second quarter.
Interest income increased $469,000 in the 2020 second quarter due to the funding of additional loan proceeds and expansion and renovation projects.
Income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $128,000 in 2Q 2020 due to mezzanine loan payoffs and reduced income from our preferred equity investment in a joint venture with an affiliate of Senior Lifestyle.
During the fourth quarter of last year, we recognized a $5.5 million impairment charge related to our $25 million investment in the joint venture.
Accordingly, we received partial liquidation proceeds of $17.5 million and recognized a loss on liquidation of unconsolidated joint ventures of $620,000.
We have a receivable balance of $1 million related to additional proceeds that we anticipate receiving throughout the second half of 2020.
Interest expense decreased $164,000 due to lower outstanding balances and lower interest rates under our line of credit in 2Q 2020 partially offset by the sale of $100 million of senior unsecured notes in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Net income available to common shareholders decreased $18.6 million due primarily to the write-off of Senior Lifestyle straight line rent receivable and lease incentive balances as well as the loss on the liquidation of our unconsolidated JV.
NAREIT FFO was $0.31 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 and $0.75 per diluted share for the same period last year.
Excluding the non-recurring items already discussed in the current period, FFO per share was $0.76 this quarter compared with $0.75 in last year's second quarter.
During the 2020 second quarter, we received $17.5 million from the sale of the properties in the JV with an affiliate of Senior Lifestyle as previously discussed and $2.1 million related to the partial paydown of an outstanding mezzanine loan.
We funded $2 million of additional proceeds under an existing mortgage loan with an affiliate of Prestige Healthcare, which is secured by four skilled nursing centers with a total of 501 beds.
The additional proceeds bear interest at 8.89% increasing 2.25% annually thereafter.
We also funded $7.4 million in development and capital improvement projects on properties we own, $200,000 under mortgage loans and paid $22.4 million in common dividends.
At June 30, we own one property under development with remaining commitments of $7.4 million.
We also have remaining commitments under mortgage loans of $2.7 million related to expansions and renovations on four properties in Michigan.
At June 30, we had $50.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.
We currently have over $510 million available under our line of credit and $200 million under our ATM program providing LTC with total liquidity of approximately $760 million.
At the end of the 2020 second quarter, our credit metrics compared favorably to the healthcare REIT industry average with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA for real estate of 4.3 times and annualized adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.9 times and a debt to enterprise value of 32%.
The effect of the economic fallout from COVID-19 on the real estate capital markets has resulted in our debt to enterprise leverage metric being higher than our long-term target of 30%.
However at 4.3 times, we are still comfortably below our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA for real estate target of below 5 times.
For the second quarter, rent deferrals were less than $1 million or approximately 2% of second quarter rent.
Approximately $277,000 of this deferred rent has been repaid.
Accordingly, at June 30, there were $653,000 in rent deferrals outstanding or about 1.5% of rent.
In July, we received two deferral requests from operators and granted one in the amount of $80,000 for July and the other totaling $280,000 for August and October rent.
Our Brookdale leases, which cover 35 properties in eight states are the only significant lease renewals through 2022.
Brookdale now has three renewal periods, consisting of one four-year renewal option, one five-year renewal option and one 10-year renewal option.
We have extended a $4 million capital commitment to Brookdale, which is available through December 31st, 2021 at a 7% yield.
Q1 trailing 12-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage using a 5% management fee was 1.39 times and 1.17 times respectively for our assisted living portfolio and 1.76 times and 1.31 times respectively for our skilled nursing portfolio.
Excluding Senior Lifestyle from our assisted living portfolio, EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages increased to 1.49 times and 1.26 times.
For our private pay portfolio, occupancy is as of that date specifically and for our skilled portfolio, occupancy is the average for the month-to-date and because our partners have provided July data to us on a voluntary and expedited basis before the month has closed, the information we are providing encompasses approximately 72% of our total private pay units and approximately 93% of our skilled nursing beds.
Private pay occupancy at March 31 was 83% and 77% at June 30 and July 17th.
For skilled nursing, average monthly occupancy for the same dates respectively was 80%, 72% and 71%.

I want to now tell you a little bit about our 30,000 foot view of our strategy.
Roughly 50% of the people tested were positive, but most notably, of these, 70% to 94% were asymptomatic.
72% of residents to be specific and 94% of our associates.
I want to also note that the majority of our communities tested 100% negative and in those communities, what we did is essentially sheltered everyone, including our staff in place.
In terms of disinfecting, we went green, which is something that Juniper has done repeatedly over our 30 years.
