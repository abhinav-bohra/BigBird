About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and over three quarters of our net sales come from products, which we believe we are the sole source provider.
In our business, we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in our commercial markets, with total commercial aftermarket revenues up 10% over Q4 of fiscal 2021 and bookings up more than 15% compared to Q4.
Commercial OEM bookings came in even stronger with almost 20% sequential improvement over Q4.
I am also very pleased that despite the challenging commercial environment, our EBITDA as defined margin was 47.3% in the quarter.
We had strong operating cash flow generation of almost $280 million and closed the quarter with a little over $4.8 billion of cash.
We are now at a decision point with regard to our sizable cash balance, which is now approaching $5 billion.
All three options are on the table each individually, but then also potentially in some combination over the next 12 months.
To reiterate what we said on the Q4 earnings call, our teams are still planning for our commercial aftermarket revenue to grow in the 20% to 30% range.
We now expect full year fiscal 2022 EBITDA margin to be slightly north of 47% due to the rate of commercial aftermarket recovery.
As a final note, this margin guidance includes the unfavorable headwind of our Cobham acquisition of about 0.5%.
The report asked for a purely voluntary refund of approximately $21 million.
At this time, we are engaged directly with the DLA and do not have any further update on whether or not we expect to pay all or a portion of the $21 million voluntary refund request.

In the commercial market, which typically makes up close to 65% of our revenue, we will split our discussion into OEM and aftermarket.
Our total commercial OEM revenue increased approximately 13% in Q1 compared with the prior year period.
Sequentially, the bookings improved almost 20% compared to Q4.
Total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 49% in Q1 when compared with prior year period.
Sequentially, total commercial aftermarket revenues grew approximately 10% and bookings grew more than 15%.
IATA currently forecasts a 39% decrease in revenue passenger miles in calendar year 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Within IATA's estimate is the expectation that domestic travel will be back to 93% of pre-pandemic levels in calendar year 2022.
Domestic air traffic for calendar 2021 was only down 28% compared to pre-pandemic versus international, which was still down 75%.
Now, let me speak about our defense market, which traditionally is at or below 35% of our total revenue.
The defense market revenue, which includes both OEM and aftermarket revenues, decreased by approximately 12% in Q1 when compared with the prior year period.
First, in regard to profitability for the quarter, EBITDA as defined of about $565 million for Q1 was up 19% versus our prior Q1.
EBITDA as defined margin in the quarter was approximately 47.3%.
This represents year-over-year improvement in our EBITDA as defined margin of about 450 basis points versus Q1 of last year.
Sequentially, EBITDA as defined margin declined slightly by about 200 basis points during Q1 versus Q4 of last fiscal year.
Organic growth was 9%, driven by the rebound in our commercial OEM and aftermarket end markets.
Free cash flow, which we traditionally defined at TransDigm as EBITDA less cash interest payments, capex and cash taxes, was roughly $250 million.
We ended the quarter with about $4.8 billion of cash.
During Q1, we also paid down our $200 million revolver balance, which was drawn at the onset of COVID in March of 2020 out of an abundance of caution.
The $200 million revolver paydown is the primary reason that our cash balance ticked up much less than the $250 million of free cash flow we generated in Q1.
Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is now at 6.7 times.
This ratio is down from 8.2 times, at its peak.
