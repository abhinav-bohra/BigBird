Fortunately, the federal government, specifically HHS and CMS have been exceptionally supportive in terms of relaxing regulations, allowing the use of telehealth where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our 19,000 patient census.
Our July 2020 admissions increased 4.3%, August increased 5.9% and September admissions expanded 4%.
Overall, our third quarter 2020 admissions increased 4.7%.
Our average daily census did decline two-tenths of 1 percentage point in the quarter.
Roto-Rooter unit-for-unit commercial revenue declining 38.6% in April, improving to a 31.8% decline in May and a decline of 19.7% in June.
Third quarter 2020 unit-for-unit commercial demand did decline 11.6% when compared to the prior year quarter.
This third quarter commercial demand is a significant improvement when compared to the 29.1% decline in the second quarter 2020 commercial revenue.
On a sequential basis, third quarter 2020 unit-for-unit commercial revenue totaled $39.5 million, an increase of 26.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Our residential services have proven to be exceptionally resilient with our unit-for-unit residential revenue declining a modest 1.6% in April, increasing 11.7% in May and 18.7% in June.
The third quarter residential demand set all-time records with July 2020 unit-for-unit residential revenue expanding 22.8%, August revenue increased 24.1%, and September 2020 residential unit-for-unit revenue increased 26.6%.

VITAS' net revenue was $337 million in the third quarter of 2020, which is an increase of 4.8% when compared to the prior year period.
This revenue increase is comprised primarily of a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 5.7%, a 0.2% decline in days-of-care and acuity mix shift, which then reduced the blended average Medicare rate increase 242 basis points.
In addition, a favorable reduction in our Medicare Cap liability increased our third quarter 2020 revenue growth 162 basis points.
Our average revenue per patient per day in the third quarter of 2020 was $194.10, which, including acuity mix shift, is 3.2% above the prior year period.
Reimbursement for routine home care and high acuity care averaged $166.51 and $971.71, respectively.
During the quarter, high acuity days-of-care were 3.4% of our total days-of-care, 57 basis points less than the prior year quarter.
This 57 basis points mix shift in high acuity days-of-care reduced the increase in average revenue per patient per day from 5.7% to 3.2% in the quarter.
In the third quarter of 2020, VITAS reversed $4.1 million in Medicare Cap billing limitations recorded in earlier quarters.
This compares to the prior year third quarter Medicare Cap billing limitation of $1.3 million.

On a unit-for-unit basis, which excludes the Oakland and HSW acquisitions completed in July of 2019 and September of 2019, respectively, Roto-Rooter generated quarterly revenue of $173 million, which is an increase of 11.4% over the prior year quarter.
Total commercial revenue, excluding acquisitions, did decline 11.6% in the quarter.

This aggregate residential revenue growth consisted of residential drain cleaning increasing 22%, plumbing and excavation expanding 31.2% and residential water restoration increasing 16.1%.
Over the past 7 months, our operating units have been able to successfully navigate within a rapidly changing environment and produce operating results that we believe provides us with the ability to issue guidance for the remainder of the calendar year.
Within this context, revenue growth for VITAS in 2020 prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 4%.
Our average daily census in 2020 is estimated to expand approximately 1.3%.
And VITAS' full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 21%.
We are currently estimating $8.6 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations for calendar year 2020.
Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve full year 2020 revenue growth of 12.5% to 13%.
This full year revenue growth assumes 2.7% of seasonal sequential revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Over the past 5 years, excluding water restoration and the impact from acquisitions, this Q3 to Q4 seasonal sequential revenue growth has averaged between 4% to 11%.
Based upon the above, Chemed's full year 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits for stock options, costs related to litigation and other discrete items, is estimated to be in the range of $18 to $18.15.
This compares to our previous guidance of $16.20 to $16.40.
This 2020 guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate of 25.8%.
And for comparison purposes, Chemed's 2019 reported adjusted earnings per diluted share was $13.95.
