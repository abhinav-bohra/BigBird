During the third quarter of 2021 the company generated revenues of $141 million and adjusted consolidated EBITDA of $8.5 million.
However, on a consolidated basis, we estimate that Hurricane Ida resulted in our third quarter revenue and EBITDA shortfalls of approximately $6 million and $3 million, respectively, offsetting the benefit of increased U.S. land based completion activity.
Highlighting our quarter was a 64% sequential increase in our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment of bookings, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5 times for the period.
During the third quarter, we generated revenues of $141 million while reporting a net loss of $13 million or $0.22 per share.
The quarterly results included noncash inventory impairment charges of $2.1 million, along with $0.7 million or $700,000 of severance and restructuring charges.
As Cindy mentioned, our adjusted consolidated EBITDA totaled $8.5 million, which excluded the inventory impairment and restructuring charges incurred in the quarter.
We continued to build cash with $68 million on hand as of September 30, compared to $63 million at the end of the second quarter.
As of September 30, the amount available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility totaled $61 million, which together with cash on hand resulted in available liquidity of $129 million, compared to $113 million at June 30.

Our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment reported revenues of $69 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $8.6 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to revenues of $77 million and adjusted segment EBITDA of $10.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2021.
Revenues decreased 10% sequentially, driven primarily by some lower connector products sales and the effects of Hurricane Ida, which caused a temporary closure of our manufacturing and service facility in Southeast Louisiana in September.
Excluding the estimated effects of Hurricane Ida, revenues and adjusted segment EBITDA would have totaled $74 million and $10.7 million, respectively, for the segment.
Backlog in total is $249 million as of September 30, 2021, a 16% sequential increase.

While improved year over year, segment revenues were down 5% sequentially due to delays in perforating product orders for some of our international customers.
Offsetting these delays, our completions product line revenues increased 7% sequentially, driven by a 33% increase in customer demand for our SmartStart and Quickstart tow valves.
In the Well Site Services segment, we generated revenues of $46 million in the third quarter of 2021 and adjusted segment EBITDA increased sequentially to $5.9 million, excluding severance and restructuring charges in the comparable periods.
