Reconciliations of the non-GAAP metrics to the nearest GAAP metric are included in ZipRecruiter shareholder letter and in our Form 10-Q.
At $212.7 million in revenue, the third quarter was another record for ZipRecruiter.
In the Great Recession of 2008, for example, the labor force contracted by around 1 million workers and retail sales fell by about 40 billion.
More than a year-end, the labor force is still smaller by 3 million workers, yet retail sales are now 90 billion higher than they were before the crisis, having recovered after only four months.
There are about 50% more job openings now than there were before the pandemic.
Building on the momentum of Q2, our third quarter revenue of $212.7 million represented another record quarter, significantly exceeding our guidance.
This represents 107% growth year over year and 16% growth over the second quarter of '21, following up on a record-shattering 48% sequential growth in quarterly paid employers in the second quarter, quarterly paid employers were flat in Q3.
Revenue per paid employer increased by 16% sequentially during the quarter, reflecting our ability to expand our relationships with paid employers as they participate in our marketplace over time.
GAAP net income was $22.1 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to net income of $23.1 million in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $42.5 million, with a 20% margin, compared to $26.7 million in adjusted EBITDA or a 26% margin in the prior year.
We believe year-over-year trends are more instructive than sequential comparisons since Q2 '21 included $31.9 million nonrecurring direct listing costs, as well as $41.7 million in stock-based compensation expense for a large number of historical RSUs that vested in the quarter, all timed with our direct listing.
We expect $206 million of revenue in Q4 of 2021 at the midpoint, which translates to 80% year-over-year growth.
Our Q4 '21 guidance translates to a midpoint of $727 million for the full year, up from the $658 million shared last quarter.
This increased 2021 revenue guidance equates to 74% growth over 2020 at the midpoint.
We expect adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $35 million at the midpoint and $96 million at the midpoint for the full year.
This is a $62 million increase from full year guidance provided last quarter and equates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13%.
