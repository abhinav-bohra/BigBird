Southern Company originally projected a $250 million to $400 million loss in revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Through thoughtful, disciplined O&M reductions, we were able to mitigate the estimated now $300 million revenue loss that we have experienced while still providing reliability and industry-leading customer satisfaction to our customers.
Even before the unrest last summer, we initiated an effort to donate $50 million to historically black colleges and universities.
As an example of this commitment, the Southern Company Foundation recently announced a partnership with Apple, where each are investing $25 million to launch the Propel Center, a new digital learning hub, business incubator and global innovation headquarters located in Atlanta for students throughout the nation of historically black colleges and universities.
Unit 4's current site work plan targets a third quarter 2022 in-service date.
From a cost perspective, Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $176 million, largely reflecting estimated COVID-19 impact and other costs, along with a replenishment of contingency to fund future expected risks that will include lower productivity rates and increased support costs.
As a result, Georgia Power recorded an after-tax charge of $131 million during the fourth quarter.
Unit three direct construction is now approximately 98% complete, and hot functional testing is expected to start in the coming weeks.
To date, 180 ITAAC have been submitted to the NRC.
We expect approximately 20 additional ITAAC to be submitted by the start of hot functional testing and the remaining 200 to be submitted during hot functional testing and as we approach fuel load.
Direct construction for Unit four is now over 75% complete.
To support the November benchmark, we will need to average construction completion of approximately 1.5% per month, which is in line with the average rate achieved during the period from last November through January.
During the fourth quarter, Georgia Power allocated its remaining contingency plus an additional $5 million and subsequently added new contingency of approximately $171 million to support completion of the project.
We estimate the pandemic has extended the schedule for both units by approximately three to four months at an estimated cost to Georgia Power of between $150 million and $190 million.
Earlier this week, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved VCM 23, which included project capital costs through June 30, 2020.
Additionally, Georgia Power files VCM 24 today.
For the full year, our adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, $0.14 higher than last year and $0.03 above the top of our guidance range.
Retail electric sales on a weather-normalized basis were down by $0.14 year-over-year, including impacts related to COVID-19, offset by customer growth.
Milder temperatures throughout 2020 resulted in an additional $0.21 negative earnings per share variance as compared to the prior year.
COVID-19 impacts reduced our projected weather normal kilowatt hour sales by 3% for the year.
Factoring in impacts across all customer classes, our nonfuel revenues declined by approximately $300 million, which was at the lower end of our original estimates as the pandemic began.
Last year, our state-regulated utilities added just over 53,000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30,000 residential natural gas customers.
Our electric customer growth was approximately 30% higher than our expectations.
Overall, we estimate that about 80% of the residential electric customer growth in 2020 was due to continued and accelerating in migration to the region, particularly in Georgia.
In 2020, we saw new investment of nearly $6 billion and nearly 25,000 jobs created across Georgia and Alabama.
Our guidance range for the year is $3.25 to $3.35 per share.
In the first quarter of 2021, we expect -- we estimate that we will earn $0.84 per share.
Additionally, we expect total retail sales growth normalized for any short-term COVID-19 impact to be flat to 1%.
We see our long-term earnings per share growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with adjusted earnings in the range of $4 to $4.30 per share by 2024.
With 90% of total projected earnings over the five year plan horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our expected earnings per share trajectory has a solid foundation.
Looking more closely at our long-term capital investment plan, we continue to allocate 95% of our capital investment to our state-regulated utilities.
Our capital investment plan of $40 billion for 2021 through 2025 includes annual projected rate base growth at our state-regulated utilities of greater than 5%, with a continued emphasis on transmission, transportation and distribution, modernization and resilience.
For Southern Power, the cumulative five year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously approved renewables projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet, which is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, we currently forecast no equity needs over our 5-year plan horizon, even when considering the potential increase in capital investment I just described.
I'll highlight that, in January, we became the first large cap utility in the U.S. to publish a sustainable financing framework, and the days that followed, Southern Power issued a 5-year green bond under that framework that resulted in a record low coupon rate.
The first is to achieve zero -- net zero emissions by 2050.
The second one is to put in place an interim milestone to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.
Regarding the intermediate goal, we achieved our 2030 goal in 2020 with preliminary greenhouse gas emissions now down 52%.
Now certainly, 2020 was an unusual year, and we may see emissions reductions move around 50% for the next two years, but we believe we'll be sustainably above our 50% reduction level by 2023.
My trusted friend and one of my closest confidantes, Mark Lantrip, plans to retire in April after dedicating 40 years to Southern Company.
