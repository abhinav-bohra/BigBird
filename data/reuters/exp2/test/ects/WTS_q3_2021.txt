Sentinel, a $6 million sales business, provides leak detection solutions mostly to the high-end residential market.
Sales of $455 million were up 18% on a reported basis and up 17% organically, driven primarily by the global economic recovery.
Foreign exchange and acquisitions combined had a favorable year-over-year impact of $5 million.

Adjusted earnings per share increased by 32% for the reasons just cited in addition to lower interest expense and reduced foreign currency transaction losses.
The adjusted effective tax rate of 26.9% is 40 basis points lower year-over-year.
For GAAP purposes, we recorded a charge of $0.9 million related to the previously announced restructuring of our Mery facility in France.

Americas' organic sales increased 17% during the quarter, with broad growth across all of our major product categories driven by strong repair and replacement and single-family residential markets and price.

Europe sales increased over 14% organically, delivering another solid quarter with expansion in both the Fluid Solutions and Drains platforms.
Europe's adjusted operating margin expanded by 420 basis points, benefiting from volume, price and productivity, which more than offset inflation, incremental investments and business normalization costs.
