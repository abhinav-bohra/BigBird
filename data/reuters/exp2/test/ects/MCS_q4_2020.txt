As a result, by the end of December, we only had 52% of our theatres open.
Now, as we noted in our release, with restrictions being lifted and improved operating assessments, we're back up to nearly 70% of our theatres open and operating now.
We were awarded multiple state government grants totaling approximately $7 million during the fourth quarter.
It's very important to note, however, that $1.5 million during the fourth quarter and $2.2 million for the full year of our reported interest expense represented non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount on our convertible notes.
Beginning January 1, we'll show the entire $100 million -- $100.1 [Phonetic] million of convertible notes as debt, that it will not be a portion allocated to equity.
Now in the fourth quarter, approximately $1 million of that total $1.5 million non-cash interest expense that I just talked about was related to the debt discount on convertible notes and that will go away in future quarters.
Also during the fourth quarter, our expense -- other expense was partially offset by other income of approximately $1.4 million related to the receipt of Movie Tavern acquisition escrow funds that were returned to us in conjunction with a negotiated earlier release of remaining escrow funds to the seller.
Now, our effective income tax rate was 33.8% during the quarter and 36.2% for the year and both periods benefited from previously described adjustments resulting from several accounting method changes and NOL carry-back provisions arising out of CARES Act.
Excluding adjustments -- favorable adjustments to income tax benefit, our effective income tax rate during fiscal 2020 was 26%.
Now, we anticipate that our effective income tax rate for 2021 may be in that 24% to 26% range once again.
Shifting gears away from the earnings statement just for a moment, our total cash capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 totaled approximately $21 million compared to our original pre-COVID projected expenditures for the year of $65 million to $85 million and approximately $94 million last year, which included the cash component of the Movie Tavern acquisition.
We only spent $2.7 million during the fourth quarter.
As we look toward capital expenditures for fiscal 2021, we're currently estimating that our fiscal '21 capital expenditures may be in the $15 million to $25 million range.
Total attendance was down 90% compared to the prior year fourth quarter, reflecting the large number of theatres that were closed for all or portions of the quarter and the fact that our open theatres are currently only operating on Tuesdays and weekends.
When you narrow that math down to just comparable attendance for theatres that were open in any given week compared to last year, comparable attendance was down approximately 87% for the quarter.
Our average admission price at our comparable theatres during the weeks that we were open decreased 13.7% during the fourth quarter but only 0.4% during fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year.
Our average admission price was unfavorably impacted by the fact that we continued to only charge $5 for older library film product and we only apply our regular pricing to new films.
We're very pleased to report an increase in our average concession in food and beverage revenues per person at our comparable theatres of 10.2% for the fourth quarter and 6.8% for fiscal 2020.
Shifting to our Hotels & Resorts division, our total RevPAR, Revenue Per Available Room, for our seven comparable owned hotels decreased 70.3% during the fourth quarter and 54.1% during fiscal 2020 compared to last year's same periods.
Now, according to data from Smith Travel Research and compiled by us in order to compare our results, our hotels were on a par with comparable upper upscale hotels throughout the United States during the fourth quarter and outperformed those same style hotels by nearly 8 percentage points for the full year.
The data also indicates that our hotels outperformed competitive hotels in our markets by nearly 6 points during the fourth quarter and nearly 16 points during fiscal 2020.
Now, breaking out the numbers for all seven comparable hotels more specifically, our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter overall RevPAR decrease was due to an overall occupancy rate decrease of 44.7 percentage points and a 16% decrease in our Average Daily Rate or ADR. Our fiscal 2020 full-year RevPAR decrease was due to an overall occupancy rate decrease of 35.4 percentage points, and a 11.6% decrease in our ADR. Our fourth quarter occupancy rate for the seven comparable owned hotels was 24.4% compared to a third quarter occupancy rate for the seven -- those same seven hotels, for the weeks that they were open, of 36.6%, reflecting the reduction in leisure travel as schools reopened and colder weather arrived.
You may recall that we reported cash and revolving credit availability of over $218 million at the end of the third quarter.
As we previously reported, we anticipate an additional income tax refund of approximately $21 million later in the year after we file our 2020 tax return with tax loss carry-forwards also available to be used in future years.
We also have over $4 million of carrying value in additional assets currently under contract or letter of intent to sell later in 2021.
In fact, we believe we may receive total sale proceeds from real estate sales during the next 12 to 18 months, totaling approximately $10 million to $40 million, depending upon demand for the real estate in question.
Finally, even after the worst year in our 85-year history, our debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of fiscal '20 was a remarkably low 37%, giving us a lot of flexibility in the future.
Those of you who've been with us for a while know that in the same 85-year history, Doug just referenced, a hallmark of this company has been the prudent management of our balance sheet.
As such, we entered this crisis from a position of strength with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 26%.
For example, a RevPAR index value of 100 would indicate that a given hotel is getting its exact fair market share of revenues per available room compared to competitive hotels in this particular market.
During the previous four fiscal years, our average combined company-owned hotel RevPAR index ranged between 108 and 112, meaning that on average, our hotels were getting 8% to 12% more market share than you would expect if everyone got their proportionate share of business.
I'm pleased to report that our average RevPAR index for these same company-owned hotels increased to 136.
Our hotels had RevPAR 36% higher than you would expect if everyone got their fair share.
An overall 24% occupancy rate is nothing to get too excited about compared to what we would normally expect during our fourth quarter, but it certainly justified our decision to reopen our hotels.
Forecasting what future RevPAR growth or decline will be during the next 18 to 24 months is very difficult at this time.
After past shocks of system such as 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis, hotel demand took longer to recover than other components of the economy.
With very few new films and renewed restrictions implemented in several very important markets for us in November and December, including Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania, the team still managed to improve adjusted EBITDA from this division by over $3 million compared to last quarter.
Initially introduced to customers via communications on our website and via our loyalty program emails as a way for up to 20 friends and family to buyout an entire auditorium for a fixed fee, we subsequently enhanced our technology and in 2021, we became one of the first theatre operators to offer customers the opportunity to purchase their private cinema experience directly from our website or our app, eliminating the need to call our sales staff.
In most cases, we charge $175 for the first two weeks of a new film and then subsequently reduce the price to $149.
So at the appropriate time, we further reduce the price to $99.
We're still showing Croods 2 on our screens and MPC has given it longer legs than we ever might have significantly originally thought.
We also charge $99 for all older library films and have experienced some very nice success with that product as well, which is particularly interesting when you consider that customers could choose to see that same product for free at home.
Just to throw a few numbers at you, in the last seven weeks alone, with just under 70% of our theatres open, we've averaged over 1,500 Marcus Private Cinema shows per week across our circuit, contributing over 25% of our admissions revenue during this time.
And in large part, because of this program, we've seen our overall market share of U.S. admissions revenues increase by approximately 50% during the first two months of 2021.
Nearly 90% of the shows during this time period were booked directly by the customer online or on our app.
In fact, this past weekend, with really only one new movie, our attendance was over 40% of our attendance last year during the same weekend at these same theatres.
In this case I'm reminded of a line from Apollo 13.
