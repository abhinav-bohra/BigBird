Finally growth goals of 6% to 8%, ex-COVID, represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.40 grew 378% versus 2020 and 3% versus 2019, exceeding the high end of guidance by $0.02 primarily due to sales outperformance and lower spend.
Adjusted operating margin of 25.1% was slightly ahead of our expectations as we continued to balance investment with the sales recovery.
We continue to be pleased with our free cash flow, with second quarter free cash flow generation of $541 million and adjusted free cash flow of $838 million.

Organically, in the U.S., U.S. grew 12% versus 2019 as strength was supported by faster than anticipated recovery of procedure volume levels, along with ongoing new product launches across the entire portfolio.
In Asia Pacific, although Q2 results included approximately 600 basis points of negative impact from the China tender pricing versus 2019, five of our businesses grew double digits, with strong growth in China, Australia, and Korea.

Second quarter consolidated revenue of $3.077 billion represents 53.6% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter 2020 and reflects an $81 million tailwind from foreign exchange.
On an operational basis, revenue growth was 49.6% in the quarter.
Sales from the Preventice acquisition contributed 240 basis points, more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, resulting in 52.4% organic revenue growth, above our guidance range of 44% to 48% growth versus 2020.
Compared to second quarter 2019, organic growth was 8.9%, above our guidance range of 3% to 6%.
This 8.9% growth excludes $15 million in 2019 sales of divested intrauterine health and embolic beads businesses, as well as $178 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, which consists of two months of Vertiflex, and a full quarter of BTG Interventional Medicines and Preventice.

Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.5%, slightly above our expectations driven by sales outperformance in higher margin businesses.
Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.1%, slightly above our expectations driven by sales outperformance and balanced investment, and also includes a reserve for a legal settlement that we expect will improve access to additional markets for some of our cardiovascular technology.
GAAP charges within the quarter additionally include $298 million in litigation-related expenses to account for incremental costs to resolve newly estimable claims, as well as known claims and corresponding legal fees within our legal reserve.
Our total legal reserve was $617 million as of June 30, an increase of $162 million versus March 31 driven by the mesh reserve increase and cardiovascular settlement, partially offset by payments to close out majority of the state attorneys general mesh settlement as well as continuing mesh product liability payments.
Moving to below-the-line, adjusted interest and other expense totaled $107 million, in line with expectations.
Our tax rate for the second quarter was 11.1% on an adjusted basis, also in line with expectations.
Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $838 million and free cash flow was $541 million, with $643 million from operating activities less $102 million net capital expenditures.
Our goal remains to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020, approximately $2.0 billion, as we continue to expect increased working capital headwinds in inventory and accounts receivable during the remainder of the year.
As of June 30, 2021, we had cash on hand of $2.7 billion.
We ended Q2 with 1.432 billion fully diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.
For the full year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18.5% to 19.5% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 50 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 19% to 20% versus 2020, and 6% to 7% versus 2019.
For the organic comparison to 2019, full year 2019 sales exclude $50 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and intrauterine health franchise, as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales; and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $490 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including Vertiflex through May, BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August, and Preventice as of March, as well as $13 million of Specialty Pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture.
For Q3 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 13% versus 2020, which includes an approximate net 100 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 14% versus 2020, and 5% to 7% growth versus 2019, which includes a 300 basis point sequential comp headwind from Q2 to Q3 2019.
For the Q3 organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $35 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio, intrauterine health franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $110 million in sales from the acquisitions of BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August and Preventice.
For adjusted operating margin, we continue to target an average of 26% in the back half of the year while simultaneously investing to more normalized operating expense levels as the first half of 2021 remained below what we would expect for a near-term run rate.
We continue to forecast our full year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 11% and our all-in tax rate to be approximately 10%.
We continue to expect adjusted below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our venture capital portfolio, and costs associated with our hedging program, to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year.
We expect fully diluted weighted-average share count of approximately 1.437 billion shares for Q3 2021 and 1.435 billion shares for full-year 2021.
We are raising full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.58 to $1.62, which includes our update to sales guidance and considers Q2 results, which removed additional uncertainty from our previously wider range.
For the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $0.39 to $0.41.
