Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 39.6% in Q1 2021 from 39% in the prior year, due primarily to higher revenues from our US franchise business.
Company-owned store margin as a percent of revenues increased to 23.9% from 22.4%, primarily as a result of strong sales leverage.
This was also up sequentially from 21.9% in Q4 2020, driven by lower labor cost as a percent of revenue in Q1 2021.
Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenues decreased to 10.5% from 11.5% in the prior year quarter.
G&A expenses increased approximately $2.8 million in Q1 as compared to Q1 2020 resulting from a combination of higher advertising expenses and labor costs, partially offset by travel.
Net interest expense increased approximately $0.9 million in the quarter, primarily the result of lower interest income.
As previously disclosed, in Q1 2021, we invested an additional $40 million in Dash brands, our master franchisee in China, following their achievement of previously established performance conditions.
Accordingly, we remeasured the original $40 million investment we made in Q2 of last year due to the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment.
This $2.5 million gain was recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2021.
Our effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter as compared to a negative 3.7% in Q1 2020.

This recapitalization will reduce our weighted average borrowing rate from 3.9% as of the end of the first quarter to approximately 3.7%.
And it will return our leverage to approximately 6 times EBITDA, consistent with our leverage model following previous recapitalizations.
Our US business performed extremely well during the quarter, highlighted by 15.3% retail sales growth and a 13.4% comp.
At 15% for the first quarter, we saw a slight sequential improvement of the two-year stack when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Now, beyond the comps, when you look at the absolute dollars, our first quarter same-store average weekly unit sales in the US exceeded $26,000.
Our addition of 36 net stores was a nice improvement over Q1 of 2020 and we anticipate a strong pipeline of future openings.
A single store closure in the quarter, on a base of over 6,000 units, demonstrates the elite economic proposition that we offer to our franchisees.
And on that note, I'm thrilled to report yet another record-setting year of franchisee profitability, with our final 2020 estimated average EBITDA number for US franchise stores coming in at just over $177,000; the highest in our history.
Our 12.8% retail sales growth was supported by a very strong 11.8% comp, continuing the momentum we saw toward the end of last year.
Q1 represented a 13.3% two-year stack, which was a 430 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2020.
Our 139 net stores in Q1 was a 100-store improvement versus the first quarter of 2020.
We continue to have temporary store closures around the world, but those have come down dramatically over the last few quarters and were below 100 at the end of the first quarter.
And we remain confident in our two-year to three-year outlook of 6% to 8% annual net store growth and 6% to 10% annual global retail sales growth.
