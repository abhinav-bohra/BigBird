If you set aside the $38 million of operating EBITDA contribution from ADS and the $60 million fuel tax credit benefit in the fourth quarter of '19 versus 2020, our legacy WM operating EBITDA grew 4% versus Q4 of 2019.
This was our seventh consecutive quarter to generate operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion, showcasing the strength and consistency of our business.
As with the third quarter, our fourth-quarter operating EBITDA margin was impressively strong at 28.1% when you consider that it included 50 basis points of dilution from ADS.
For the full year, 2020 matched our highest annual operating EBITDA margin of 28.4%.
And excluding ADS, we set a new record with 2020 operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5%.
As a result, we anticipate overall operating EBITDA growth between 10 and 13 and a half percent in 2021.
As expected, legacy Waste Management collection and disposal volumes improved sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of 5.5% in the third quarter to a decline of 2.7% in the fourth.
Fourth-quarter MSW volume grew 1.2% and C&D volume, excluding hurricane cleanup, grew 1.8%, both strong indicators of continued economic recovery.
Collection and disposal yield was 2.3% in the fourth quarter, and core price was 3.2%.
Adjusted for the impact of lower volume, core price would have been 3.8%.
Our residential yield improved 60 basis points to 3.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2019 and was up again sequentially from 3.5% in the third quarter.
Residential volumes declined 1.4% as we shed business that does not meet our return requirements.
Overall, our actions to improve the residential line of business in 2020 resulted in $40 million of operating EBITDA benefit, and we expect this to carry forward into 2021.
In the post-collection business, fourth quarter landfill core price was 3.3% and transfer station core price was 3.1%, demonstrating our continued pricing discipline in these key lines of business.
Operating costs were 61.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In the quarter, as expected, the ADS acquisition increased operating expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points.
Additionally, the timing of government approvals for fuel tax credits, which benefited the fourth quarter of 2019 with two years worth of credits, resulted in a 150-basis-point headwind to operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Aside from these impacts, operating costs as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points, demonstrating that we are laser-focused on cost control and continue to benefit from a lower cost structure.
As an example, commercial yards and industrial halls declined between 5% and 6% during the fourth quarter, yet overtime decreased in the range of 15% to 18%, and we see additional opportunities.
We expect organic revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of between four and four and a half percent and overall revenue growth between 10.75% and 11.25% during 2021.
We expect to achieve between $50 million and $60 million in synergies during 2021.
Combined with the $10 million to $15 million of annualized synergies already achieved in the fourth quarter, our run rate synergies exiting 2021 is expected to be between $60 million and $75 million.
We estimate that our onetime cost to achieve these synergies will be $50 million in 2021.
We expect continued improvement in recycling from our fee-for-service model, improved operating cost structure at new MRFs and stable demand for recycled materials, which, together, provide a tailwind of between $40 million and $50 million to 2021 operating EBITDA.
We also expect an incremental $10 million of year-over-year contribution from our renewable energy business from the sale of RINs as pricing for those credits has increased over the last several months.
Excluding $25 million of SG&A for the ADS business, SG&A improved by $56 million in 2020 to 10.2% of revenue, a 10-basis-point improvement over 2019.
Fourth quarter capital spending was $394 million, and that included $29 million of capital to support [Inaudible] ADS and about $30 million of capital that we intentionally pulled forward given the strong recovery in our operations during the third and fourth quarters.
2020 capital spending was $1.632 billion.
Waste Management generated free cash flow of $2.656 billion in 2020.
After-tax proceeds from the divestitures of ADS and Waste Management businesses to GFL were $691 million.
These proceeds were partially offset by after-tax transaction and advisory costs to support the acquisition of $117 million.
Normalizing for these two items, 2020 free cash flow was $2.082 billion.
This result demonstrates the resilient nature of our business and the strength of capital discipline as we nearly achieved our original 2020 free cash flow guidance of $2.15 billion despite the impact of COVID-19.
Given the strong result, at the end of 2020, we were positioned to forgo relief provided by the CARES Act, and we elected to pay approximately $120 million of payroll taxes that we had planned to defer.
As we repay that amount in 2021 and 2022, as anticipated, 2020 free cash flow, excluding the ADS impact I mentioned, would have been about $2.2 billion for the year, which is better than we expected at the end of the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $231 million in dividend.
For the full year, we returned $1.33 billion to shareholders, comprised of $927 million in dividends and $402 million in share repurchases.
In November, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes at an extremely attractive pre-tax weighted average cost of less than one and a half percent.
2021 cash interest savings are expected to be more than $90 million.
Fourth quarter total debt-to-EBITDA of 3.19 times and forecasted leverage ratios are both well within the financial covenants of our revolving credit facilities.
As John mentioned, we anticipate 10.75% to 11.25% revenue growth in the year ahead with solid organic growth in the collection and disposal business of between four and four and a half percent.
This underpins our 2021 operating EBITDA guidance of $4.75 million and $4.9 million.
We expect this strong earnings growth to drive free cash flow of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion.
Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.78 billion and $1.88 billion in 2021.
Excluding about $90 million of capital planned to support the ADS integration, this expectation is in line with our long-term capital spend as a percentage of revenue target of nine and a half to 10 and a half percent even while we step up our investments in CSD.
We expect our dividend payments to be about $975 million in 2021.
Given our focus on the ADS integration, we expect tuck-in acquisitions to be on the lower end of our typical range of $100 million to $200 million.
With more than $1 billion remaining from our free cash flow guidance, we plan to allocate that to a combination of debt repayment, share repurchases and the high-return, sustainability-focused, capital investment opportunities I described earlier.
