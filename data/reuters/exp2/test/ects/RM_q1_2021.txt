In the first quarter, we generated record bottom-line results of 25.5 million of net income and $2.31 of diluted earnings per share.
At the same time, we maintained a superior credit profile with historically low 30-plus day delinquencies.
Despite pressure from a combination of tax refunds and two stimulus payments in the quarter, our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $18 million, or 2%, over the prior-year period, and was down only $28 million, or 2.5%, quarter over quarter.
We originated $231 million of loans in the quarter, up 1% year over year and up 5% from the first quarter of 2019, with 29 million [Inaudible] originated loans derived from new growth initiatives.
The second round of $600 stimulus checks appeared to have been spent relatively quickly.
The third round of $1,400 stimulus checks led to a temporary period of higher loan payment activity along with some weakening of loan demand.
Our large loan portfolio actually grew sequentially in the first quarter by $4 million or 0.6% as the stimulus measures disproportionately impacted our higher-rate small loan portfolio.
Loan demand remained relatively soft in April due to the impact of the distribution of the remaining 20% of stimulus payments along with additional tax refunds.
Our net credit loss rate during the quarter was 7.7%, a 280 basis points improvement from the prior-year period.
And we ended the quarter with a record-low, 30-plus day delinquency rate of 4.3%, a 230 basis points improvement from the end of March of 2020.
As of April 30, our 30-plus day contractual delinquency rate further improved to approximately 3.7%.
Given our continued superior credit performance, we released $6.6 million in COVID-19 reserves in the first quarter and $3.8 million of additional reserves as a result of the seasonal runoff in the portfolio.
our 139.6 million allowance for credit losses as of March 30 first continues to compare quite favorably to our 30-plus day contracts of delinquency of 47.7 million.
Our allowance includes a 23.8 million reserve for additional credit losses associated with COVID-19.
To that end, we are happy to announce an increase of our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.25 per share.
In addition, in May, we completed a $30 million stock repurchase program that began in the fourth quarter of 2020, having repurchase, in total, 951,841 shares at a weighted average price of $31.52 per share.
Our board of directors recently authorized a new $30 million stock repurchase program, which we plan to commence later this month.
Digitally sourced originations represented 33% of our total new borrower branch volume in the first quarter and 25% of all branch originations we bought remotely in March.
We plan to open 15 to 20 net new branches in 2021.
We also expect to enter up to two additional states by the end of 2021 and an additional four to six states over the next 18 months.
As of March 31, approximately 70% of our total portfolio had been originated since April 2020.
We generated net income of 25.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.31, resulting from our growth initiatives, stable operating expenses, lower funding costs, and strong credit.
As illustrated on Page 4, branch originations were comparable to prior year as we ended first quarter, originating 169.7 million of loans.
Meanwhile, we grew direct mail and digital origination by 9% year over year to 61.7 million.
Our total originations were 231.4 million, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2019 despite two rounds of government stimulus payments in the first quarter.
Our new growth initiative [00:13:13.23] [Inaudible] 29 million of first quarter origination.
Page 5 displays our portfolio growth and mixed trends through March 31.
We closed the quarter with net finance receivables of 1.1 billion, up 3 million from the prior-year period as we continue to successfully execute on our new growth initiatives and marketing efforts.
Our core loan portfolio grew 18 million, or 1.7%, from the prior year and decreased only 2.5% from the end of the fourth quarter, in line with normal seasonal liquidation despite the two rounds of government stimulus.
Small loans decreased 8% quarter over quarter due to the disproportionate impact of the stimulus payments on this portfolio, while large loans grew slightly at 0.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2020.
On Page 6, we show our digitally sourced originations, which were 33% of our new borrower volume in the first quarter.
During the first quarter, large loans were 64% of our digitally sourced originations.
Turning to Page 7, total revenue grew 2% to 97.7 million.
Interest in field increased 10 basis points year over year, primarily due to improved credit performance across the portfolio as a result of the government stimulus, tightened underwriting during the pandemic, and our overall mix shift toward higher credit quality customers.
Sequentially, interest in field and total revenue yield decreased 80 and 90 basis points, respectively.
As of March 31, 65% of our portfolio were large loans and 81% of our portfolio had an APR at or below 36%.
In the second quarter, we expect total revenue yield to be approximately 30 basis points lower than the first quarter, and our interest in field to be approximately 20 basis points lower due to the impact that the third and largest stimulus payment is expected to have on our higher-yielding small loan portfolio.
Moving to Page 8, our net credit loss is 7.7% for the first quarter, a 280-basis-point improvement year over year, while delinquencies remain at historically low levels.
Net credit loss is roughly 80 basis points from the fourth quarter.
This is due to normal seasonal increases of NPLs in the first quarter, but the rate of increase of 80 basis points in frst quarter was below the 150 and 180 basis point seasonal increases that we experienced in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
As a result, we expect that our full-year net credit loss rate will be approximately 8%.
Our 30-plus day delinquency levels as of March 31 was a record 4.3%, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year and 100 basis points lower than December 31.
At the end of April, we saw 30-plus day delinquencies dropped further to a record low of approximately 3.7%.
Moving forward, we expect 30-plus day delinquencies to gradually rise off the April low to more normal levels.
Turning to Page 10, we ended the fourth quarter with an allowance for credit losses of 150 million or 13.2% of net finance receivables.
During the first quarter of 2021, the allowance decreased by 10.4 million to 12.6% of net finance receivables.
The decrease in reserves, including the base reserve release of 3.8 million from portfolio liquidation and a COVID-19 reserve release of 6.6 million.
At the moment, the severity and the duration of our macro assumptions remain relatively consistent with our fourth-quarter model, including an assumption that the unemployment rate will be below 10% at the end of 2021.
Our 139.6 million allowance for credit losses as of March 31 continues to compare very favorably toward 30-plus day contractual delinquency of 47.7 million.
Looking to Page 11, G&A expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were 45.8 million, an improvement of 0.4 million or 0.9% from the prior-year period.
Our operating expense ratio was 16.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 16.5% in the prior-year period.
On a sequential basis, our G&A expense rose 1 million, in line with our expectations due to lower deferred loan origination costs and fewer seasonal loan originations in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter.
Overall, we expect G&A expenses for the second quarter to be approximately 2.2 million higher than the first quarter.
Turning the Page 12, interest expense was 7.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 2.6% of our average net finance receivables.
This was a 100 basis point improvement year over year and 3 million, or 30%, lower than in the prior-year period.
The improved cost of funds was driven by lower interest rate environment, improved funding costs from our recent securitization transactions, and a favorable 785,000 mark-to-market increase in value this quarter on our interest rate cap.
We currently have 400 million of interest rate caps to protect us against rising rates on our variable priced funding, which as of the end of the first quarter, totaled 193 million.
We purchased 100 of additional interest rate caps in the first quarter to take advantage of the favorable rate environment.
We purchased a total of 300 million of interest rate caps since the beginning of the pandemic at a LIBOR strike price range of 25 to 50 basis points.
Looking ahead, normalizing for the hedge impact in the first quarter, we expect interest expense in the second quarter to be approximately 8.5 million.
Our effective tax rate during the first quarter was 24%, compared to a tax rate of 36% in the prior-year period.
For 2021, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25%.
Page 13 is a reminder of our strong funding profile.
Our first-quarter funded debt-to-equity ratio remained at a very conservative 2.7-1.
We continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet with low leverage and 140 million in loan loss reserves.
As of March 31, we had 573 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and 207 million of available liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and immediate availability to draw down our credit facility.
Our total warehouse capacity has expanded by 175 million to 300 million, and the average term on the new warehouse is approximately 22, roughly a four-month extension from the prior facility.
As of April 30th, we had 758 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities, providing us with even more capacity to fund our operations, our ambitious growth plans, and our capital return program.
In the first quarter, the company repurchased 352,183 of its common stock at a weighted average price of $33.57 per share.
under the company's 30 million stock repurchase program.
