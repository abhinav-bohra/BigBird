With yesterday's earnings announcement, we raised expectations for 2021 and now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 17% compared with 2020.
As we look toward 2022, high single to low double-digit growth in EBITDA appears reasonable in the $50 to $70 per barrel price range when you adjust 2021 for the approximately $90 million weather impact to revised guidance.
With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2021 net income and earnings per share guidance 10% and adjusted EBITDA guidance 5% compared with our original expectations provided in late February.
We now expect a net income midpoint of $1.35 billion or $3.02 per share, and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $3.2 billion this year.
Total capital expenditures for 2021, including growth and maintenance capital, remain unchanged from our original expectations of $525 million to $675 million, a more than 70% decrease compared with 2020.
ONEOK's first-quarter 2021 net income totaled $386 million or $0.86 per share.
First-quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $866 million, a 24% increase year over year and a 17% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2020.
Distributable cash flow was more than $660 million in the first quarter, a 27% increase year over year and a 28% increase compared with the fourth-quarter 2020.
First-quarter dividend coverage was nearly 1.6 times, and we generated more than $245 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter.
Our March 31 net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.98 times compared with 4.6 times at the end of 2020.
We ended the quarter -- the first quarter with no borrowings on our $2.5 billion credit facility and more than $400 million of cash.
Earlier this month, the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter.
In addition, we sold 5.2 Bcf of natural gas, which we previously held in inventory, into the market in the first-quarter 2021 to help meet the increased demand.
This compares with 1.2 Bcf that we sold in the first quarter of 2020.
Systemwide volumes were reduced by an average of approximately 64,000 barrels per day during the quarter, with the largest impacts in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast Permian regions.
First-quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20% year over year despite an 11,000 barrel per day impact from Winter Storm Uri.
As we sit today, volumes from the region have reached more than 300,000 barrels per day.
Discretionary ethane that can be recovered on our system in both the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions remains approximately 100,000 barrels per day.
In the Rockies region, full recovery would provide an opportunity for $400 million in an annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates.
In the Rocky Mountain region, first-quarter processed volumes increased 5% year over year despite colder-than-normal weather in February.
In March, volumes exceeded 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, a level we can maintain even without increased producer activity.
Once complete, we will have approximately 1.7 Bcf per day of processing capacity in the basin, and we'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital as producer activity levels increase.
In the first quarter, we connected 38 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and expect to connect more than 300 this year.
There are currently 16 rigs operating in the basin with eight on our dedicated acreage, and there continues to be a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basinwide and approximately 350 on our dedicated acreage.
Additionally, as of February, approximately 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas flaring remained on our dedicated acreage, presenting a continued opportunity for us to bring this volume onto our system and help further reduce flaring in the basin.
The gathering and processing segment's average fee rate remained $1.04 per MMBtu during the quarter, unchanged from the fourth-quarter 2020.
Winter Storm Uri reduced Mid-Continent volumes by approximately 30 million cubic feet per day for the quarter, causing the average fee rate mix to shift more toward the Rocky Mountain volumes, driving the higher average rate.
We now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average close to the high end of our $0.95 to $1 per MMBtu guidance range.
