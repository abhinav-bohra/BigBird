On a per share basis, first quarter earnings were $1.93 compared to a loss per share of $1.06 last year and earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter of 2019.
This year's quarter includes pre-tax charges of $2 million related to the impairment of one of the company's minority investments, and $2 million primarily related to severance costs in connection with the reorganization of certain support functions.
Excluding these items, first quarter non-GAAP earnings were $1.96 per share, a significant reversal to the loss per share of $0.67 for the first quarter of last year and up 28.1% compared to earnings per share of $1.53 for the first quarter of 2019.
Our digital business also remained quite strong, up 43% on a comp basis and landing at a penetration rate of 25% of our total sales, which was higher than our expectations coming into the quarter.
As we expected, COVID-related restrictions pressured our business in Europe throughout Q1, as the EMEA fleet was opened only 39% of possible operating days in the quarter.
We continue to see enrollment increase with over 20 million members now enrolled in the countries where the program is active.
We continue to feel that impact on our business in Europe and Canada, where roughly 230 stores are temporarily closed.
Our footwear business increased over 70%, while our apparel and accessory businesses were both up triple digits.
And we will continue to enhance our storytelling in Q2 through our celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Griffey 1 with our Nike concept and our second installment of All Day I Dream About Sneakers with Adidas.
On the latter, in addition to our work to advance education and economic opportunities for the black communities we serve, we have also established partnerships with 45 new black-owned brands and creators to provide a platform to showcase their design collaborations this year.
Our comp sales increased 80.3% in spite of store closures in Europe and Canada and supply chain pressures in the U.S. and EMEA.
This, coupled with leverage on our SG&A expense, drove a meaningful swing in first quarter earnings per share versus last year's loss and a nearly 30% increase over Q1 of 2019.
Total sales increased 83% over last year and 3.6% over Q1 of 2019.
On a constant currency basis, sales increased 79% over Q1 of 2020.
The strength was primarily driven by our stores, which increased 99%.
Let me remind you that our fleet was open 83% of potential operating days in the quarter versus 48% last year.
While our U.S. and Asia Pacific banners were essentially fully opened, EMEA and Canada continued to face pressure due to COVID restrictions, opened roughly 39% and 75% of potential operating days, respectively.
Our direct-to-consumer channel remained quite healthy as well, with sales up 47% as customers truly embraced our omnichannel offering.
DTC was 25% of total sales for the quarter compared to 31% last year.
The rest of the U.S. banners follow with comps up over 90% and Foot Locker Canada posted a low 70% gain as it contended with store closures as we previously discussed.
Foot Locker Asia delivered a triple-digit comp gain, while Foot Locker Pacific increased in the mid-90% range.
Despite extensive COVID restrictions, Foot Locker Europe still posted a high 30% comp increase.
Gross margin was 34.8% compared to 23% last year.
When compared to a more normal Q1 2019, gross margin improved 160 basis points.
Our merchandise margin rate improved 250 basis points over last year and 80 basis points over 2019, as the meaningful reduction in markdowns more than offset the higher freight expense that comes with increased penetration of digital sales.
Inclusive of approximately $5 million of COVID-related rent abatements in the quarter, our occupancy costs leveraged 80 basis points over Q1 of 2019.
Our SG&A expense rate came in at 19.4% of sales in the quarter, as our strong sales results provided us with 750 basis points of leverage over last year and 60 basis points of leverage compared to 2019.
In addition to careful expense control, we received approximately $10 million in government subsidies, which partially offset nearly $2 million of incremental PPE expense and 90 basis points of higher bonus expense.
For the quarter, depreciation expense was up slightly to last year at $45 million.
Net interest expense increased $1 million compared to last year due to lower levels of interest income on our cash balance.
Our tax rate came in at 28.7% versus 22% in Q1 last year.
We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with over $1.9 billion of cash, an increase of $951 million as of the end of Q1 last year.
We currently have no outstanding borrowings on our $600 million credit facility.
At the end of Q1, inventory was down 30% compared to last year.
However, keep in mind that at the end of Q1 2020, our inventory was up 20%, which was due to the elevated store closures resulting from the pandemic.
We invested approximately $51 million into our business during the quarter.
This funded the opening of 12 new stores as well as the remodeling or relocating of 15 stores.
We also closed 58 stores in the quarter, primarily in the U.S., leaving us with 2,952 company-owned stores at the end of Q1.
For the full year, we now expect to open approximately 160 stores, remodel or relocate 120 and close 240.
Looking ahead, we are tracking toward approximately $275 million in capital expenditures this year, in line with our prior guidance.
In terms of shareholder returns, we paid out $21 million in dividends this quarter and repurchased approximately 620,000 shares for $34 million.
For the second quarter, looking at sales, keep in mind that our comps were up nearly 19% last year in what is historically our lowest volume quarter of the year.
Please keep in mind that we face a $6 million headwind for rent abatements we obtained in Q2 last year.
We anticipate SG&A to be elevated compared to 2020 as we lap the unique elements that benefited Q2 last year, including $17 million in government subsidies and reduced store operating costs.
