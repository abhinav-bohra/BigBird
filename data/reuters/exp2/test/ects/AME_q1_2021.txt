Overall sales in the quarter were up 1% versus the prior year to $1.22 billion.
Organic sales were up 1% with the divestiture of Reading Alloys being offset by a two point foreign currency tailwind.
Overall, orders in the quarter were a record $1.4 billion, up 16% compared to the same period last year, with organic orders up 9%.
This led to a book-to-bill of 1.15 and a record backlog of $2 billion.
Operating income in the quarter was $293 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020.
Operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 24.1%.
EBITDA in the quarter was $356 million, up 4% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 29.2%.

Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong with operating cash flow of 5% to $284 million and free cash flow conversion of 122% of net income.
Sales for Electronic Instruments Group in the quarter were $791 million, up 2% over last year's first quarter driven by modest organic sales growth and a 1.5% foreign currency tailwind.
EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $207 million, up 7% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 26.2%.
EMG's first quarter sales were $425 million, down 1% versus the prior year.
Organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, while the divestiture of Reading Alloys was a five point headwind and foreign currency was a two point tailwind.
EMG's operating income was a record $105 million in the quarter, up 8% compared to the same quarter last year, and EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 190 basis points to a record 24.7%.
These actions positioned us to capitalize on an improving acquisition environment in a significant manner, deploying $1.85 billion to acquire five excellent businesses, thus far this year.
Abaco has approximately $325 million in annual sales, and we deployed $1.35 billion on the acquisition.
Magnetrol has annual sales of approximately $100 million, and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition.
NSI-MI has annual sales of approximately $90 million, and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition.
Combined, these acquisitions add approximately $535 million in annual sales aligned with attractive secular growth markets.
And as Bill will discuss in a moment, we have ample balance sheet capacity with approximately $1.8 billion available to support our acquisition strategy.
For all of 2021, we expect to invest approximately $95 million in incremental growth investments.
For all of 2021, we expect to spend approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales on RD&E for our base businesses before adding in our recent acquisitions.
This level of spend is up 10% over last year's RD&E spend.
Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.56, which is an increase of 13% to 15% over last year's comparable basis.
This new range is a $0.28 midpoint increase from our previous adjusted earnings guidance of $4.18 to $4.30 per diluted share.
For the second quarter, overall sales are anticipated to be up in the low 30% range versus last year's quarter.
Second quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10, up 29% to 31% over last year's second quarter.
First quarter, general and administrative expenses were $18.6 million, up $3 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense.
As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% in the quarter.
For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be up approximately $12 million on a return of temporary costs, including compensation.
The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%, which was essentially in line with the adjusted 19.4% reported in the same period last year.
For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.
For the quarter, operating working capital was 14.2%, down 470 basis points from the 18.9% reported in the first quarter of 2020.
Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $18 million.
For the full year we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter was $65 million.
For all of 2021, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $140 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
In the first quarter, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 5% over last year's first quarter to $284 million and $267 million, respectively.
Free cash flow conversion was very strong at 122% of net income in the quarter.
Total debt at quarter end was $2.35 billion, down from $2.41 billion at the end of 2020, offsetting this debt with cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion.
At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times.
During the first quarter, we deployed approximately $270 million on the acquisitions Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS Automation.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisition of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI, resulting in $1.85 billion in total capital deployed on strategic acquisitions thus far this year.
Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced we entered into a five-year delayed-draw bank term loan for up to $800 million with existing lenders under our revolving credit facility.
Following the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is expected to be 1.9 times and 1.7 times, respectively, at the end of the second quarter.
We continue to have an excellent financial capacity with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.
