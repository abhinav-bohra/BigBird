Today, I'll focus my comments on our performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2020, our market outlook for 2021, Oceaneering's consolidated 2021 outlook, including our expectation to generate positive free cash flow in excess of the amount generated in 2020, and EBITDA in the range of $160 million to $210 million and our business segment outlook for the full year and first quarter of 2021.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported a net loss of $25 million or $0.25 per share on revenue of $424 million.
These results include the impact of $9.8 million for pre-tax adjustments associated with asset impairments and write-offs, restructuring and other expenses and foreign exchange losses recognized during the quarter, and $9.6 million of discreet tax adjustments.
Adjusted net income was $1.8 million or $0.02 per share.
We were pleased that our consolidated fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation, and amortization or adjusted EBITDA was $47.1 million and was sequentially higher than the third-quarter 2020 and exceeded both our guidance and consensus estimates.
Fourth-quarter 2020 consolidated adjusted operating income of $9.6 million was the best quarterly performance in 2020 and $4 million higher than the third quarter.
We generated $104 million of cash from operating activities.
And after deducting $15 million in capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $89 million for the quarter.
As a result of good operating cash flow, working capital efficiencies, and capital expenditure discipline, our cash position increased by $93.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, our cash balance stood at $452 million.
Adjusted fourth-quarter operating results included recognition of approximately $3 million of cost-structure improvements achieved throughout 2020.

The revenue split between our remotely operated vehicle or ROV business and our combined tooling and survey businesses as a percentage of our total SSR revenue was 80% and 20% respectively compared to 82% and 18% split in the prior quarter.
Our fleet utilization for the fourth quarter was 54% down from 59% in the third quarter and our days on hire declined for both drill support and vessel-based services.

Subject to quarterly variances, we continue to expect our drills support market share to generally approximate 60%.
Adjusted operating income margin increased to 9% in the fourth quarter of 2020 from 5% in the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to favorable contract closeouts and supply chain savings.
Our manufactured products backlog at December 31, 2020, was $266 million, compared to our September 30, 2020 backlog of $318 million.
Our book to bill ratio was 0.4 for the full year of 2020, as compared with the trailing 12-month book to bill a 0.5 at September 30, 2020.

This program targeted the removal of $125 million to $160 million of costs, including depreciation.

With the opex plus actions taken at the very beginning of 2021 and growing optimism associated with numerous vaccine approvals, many analysts and energy researchers are now forecasting Brent pricing to stabilize in the $55 to $60 per barrel range for 2021 and longer-term pricing to be in the $50 to $70 per barrel range.
We expect Brent pricing in the $55 to $65 per barrel range will support reasonable levels of IMR activity in 2021.
Similarly, we believe that longer-term Brent pricing forecast of $50 to $70 per barrel will support increased offshore project sanctioning activity in 2021.
Analyst data suggests that the floating rig count has stabilized and throughout 2021 will remain close to the year-end 2020 levels of approximately 130 contracted rigs.
There were 123 Tree Awards in 2020 and raise that forecasts a modest recovery to around 200 in 2021 and back into the 300 range in 2022, raise that also forecast Tree Installations of 273 in 2021, which approaches the 2020 total of 299.
Also, according to raise did offer projects with an aggregate value of approximately $46 billion were sanctioned in 2020, a 53% decrease from 2019.
Sanctioning levels are expected to increase in 2021 to around $55 billion and return to 2019 levels of around $100 billion in 2022.
Raise that forecast global installed offshore wind capacity to increase by 11.8 gigawatts by in 2021, 37% over 2020.
For the year, we anticipate generating $160 million to $210 million of adjusted EBITDA with positive operating income and adjusted EBITDA contributions from each of our operating segments.
Our liquidity position at the beginning of 2021 remains robust with $452 million of cash and an undrawn $500 million revolver available until October 2021, and thereafter $450 million available until January 2023.
As has been the case over the past several years, it is our intent to continue to strengthen our balance sheet to ensure that we are well-positioned to deal with our $500 million bond maturity in November 2024.
For 2021, we expect our organic capital expenditures to total between $50 million and $70 million.
This includes approximately $35 million to $40 million of maintenance capital expenditures and $15 million to $30 million of growth capital expenditures.
In 2021, interest expense, net of interest income is expected to be approximately $40 million and our cash tax payments are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million.
These cash tax payments do not include the impact of approximately $28 million of CARES Act tax refunds expected to be received in 2021.
For ROVs, we expect our 2020 service mix of 62% drill support and 38% vessel services to generally remain the same through 2021.
Our overall ROV fleet utilization is expected to be in the mid to high 50% range for the year with higher seasonal activity during the second and third quarters.
We expect to generally sustain our ROV market share in the 60% range for drill support.
At the end of 2020, there were approximately 24 Oceaneering ROVs onboard 21 floating drilling rigs with contract terms expiring during the first six months of 2021.
During that same period, we expect 28 of our ROVs on 24 floating rigs to begin new contracts.
For 2021, we anticipate unallocated expenses to average in the low to mid-$30 million range per quarter as we forecast higher accrual rates for projected short and long-term performance-based incentive compensation expense, as compared to 2020.
For our first-quarter 2021 outlook, we expect our first-quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $45 million to $50 million on sequentially higher revenue.
