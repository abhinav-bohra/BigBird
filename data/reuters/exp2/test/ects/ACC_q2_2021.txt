Since the DCP program recommenced only two months ago, we have already moved in over 3,200 students.
And we continue to project 85% occupancy by the fall for the 4,996 beds delivered through Phase 5.
Velocity for the 2022 same-store group surpassed the prior year's pace in early July and is now 310 basis points ahead of the prior year.
The guidance we have provided for the academic year '21 lease-up assumes strong opening rental revenue growth of 5.1% to 7.6% based on an occupancy range of 92% to 94% and an average rent per occupied bed growing at 3% to 3.5% for the '22 same-store group.
For our on-campus ACE properties, where the university administers the lease-up, we are nearly 98% pre-leased.
The tailwinds also include a significant downward trend in national new supply continuing at least through the 2022, 2023 academic year, including a currently projected decrease of over 20% in ACC markets.
During the quarter, we renewed our corporate revolver, extending the maturity to 2025 and improved our borrowing costs by 15 basis points to LIBOR plus 85 bps.
Also, we raised $60 million of equity proceeds during the second quarter at a weighted average price of $49.05 per share, which was in line with analyst NAV estimates at the time and was allocated to the funding of the ongoing construction of our 6.8% high-yielding Disney development.
