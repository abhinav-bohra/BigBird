First, as shown on the bottom left portion of the page, we placed the Smithburg one processing plant online in early July, adding 200 million cubic feet a day of incremental joint venture processing capacity.
This brings the joint venture's total processing capacity to 1.6 Bcf per day.
Consistent with our just-in-time capital investment philosophy, the joint venture processing capacity was 96% utilized during the third quarter.
We have identified approximately 5,200 premium undeveloped locations for industry in the Southwest Marcellus, which are located within the red line -- the red outlines on the map.
Of that, we estimate AR holds 1,865 of these premium locations or 36% of the total, which includes more than 1,000 liquids-rich locations.
In the Ohio Utica, we estimate roughly 1,100 premium undeveloped locations for industry, of which AR holds 210 locations or 19% of the total.
Importantly, for AM, its primary producer, AR, has over 15 years of liquids-rich drilling inventory and a highly contiguous acreage position, which results in efficient midstream build-outs and peer-leading return on invested capital for AM.
Specifically, approximately 1/3 of AR's LPG exports went to developing nations in 2020, which included Nigeria, Peru and India to name a few.
With a companywide focus on safety, we had 0 employee lost-time incidences for the sixth consecutive year.
In 2020, we reduced our methane leak loss rate to 0.015% and significantly below the ONE Future industry goal of 1% and more than 50% lower than the midstream industry peer average of 0.033%.
Our integrated water system allowed us to recycle and reuse 84% of AR's total wastewater gathered.
In addition, 100% of freshwater used in completions was transported by pipeline, eliminating 32 million truck traffic miles and avoiding 14,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
During the quarter, we maintained our high asset utilization rates with compression capacity averaging 86% utilization and processing and fractionation capacity averaging 96% and 93%, respectively.
These impressive utilization rates include the 200 million a day of incremental JV processing capacity at Smithburg one, which was placed in service at the early part of the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $219 million, Capital expenditures during the quarter were $80 million.
For the full year, we still expect to be within our capital guidance range of $240 million to $260 million.
During the third quarter, we generated $94 million of free cash flow before dividends.
Year-to-date, free cash flow after dividends has totaled $32 million, which has allowed us to reduce our leverage to 3.6 times.
As of September 30, we had $521 million drawn on our bank credit facility.
As you recall, in the second quarter, we refinanced the 2024 senior notes extending the maturity to 2029 at the same coupon of five 3/8.
In October, we extended our bank maturity by five years to 2026, resulting in no senior note or debt maturities until 2026.
In addition, we elected to reduce our bank credit facility commitments from $2.13 billion to $1.25 billion.
As a reminder, we previously announced that we are targeting approximately $500 million of free cash flow after dividends from 2021 through 2025, which would result in a completely undrawn credit facility at the end of that time period, assuming that free cash flow is utilized to repay credit facility borrowings.
