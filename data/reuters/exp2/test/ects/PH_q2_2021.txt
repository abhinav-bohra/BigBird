If you move to Slide 3, you'll see our agenda, we'll begin with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams, providing some strategic comments and highlights from our second quarter, following Tom's comments, I'll provide a more detailed review of our second quarter performance and review the components of our increased to guidance for the remainder of our fiscal year FY '21.
Now, before I move to Slide 4, I want to make a few opening comments.
So if you go to Slide 4, one of our key competitive advantages are breadth in motion control technologies.
We're now up to two-thirds of our revenue this -- you heard me talk about this is probably 160% but now the two-thirds of our revenue comes from customers who buy from four more of these technologies.
If you move to Slide 5, we just had outstanding performance in the quarter.
Top quartile safety performance, we had a 23% reduction in recordable incidents this now makes 75% reduction for the last five years, which has been phenomenal.
Sales decline was 2.5% year-over-year, you can see it was a little over 6% from an organic standpoint this was significantly better than our guidance and about a 50% plus improvement from where we were on Q1.
Q2 was a record net income at $447 million, the EBITDA margin was a little over 23%, as reported or 20.8% adjusted.
You can see the significant improvement versus prior 230 basis points.
Year-to-date cash flow from operations was a record at 20.4% of sales.
And then the table to bottom there has got segment operating margin, both as reported and adjusted basis so I'd call your attention to the adjusted row, 20.4% segment our operating margin adjusted and again a giant increase versus prior plus 230 basis points.
So the easy way to remember this is, is the quarter we put up 320's and we happen to highlight them in gold, so greater than 20% EBITDA margin, CFOA margin and segment operating margin, so we're pretty proud of that.
If you go to Slide 6, we're going to talk about cash flow the cash flow quarter paid down $767 million of debt in a quarter.
If you look at our last 14 months it's $2.8 billion of debt this was a little over half of the acquisition debt, so we took almost organic size, just great progress there.
You see the ratios in the middle of the page there, of significance, if we go back a year ago, we were 4.0 and now we're at 2.7 on a gross debt to EBITDA basis.
And we've now reinstated effective in this quarter Q3 our 10b5-1 share repurchase program.
So we go to Slide 9, the Win Strategy and this is 3.0, this is our business system a pound for pound this has been the most impactful change we've made to-date to the Win Strategy, and it's going to be Win 3.0 and our purpose statement.
If you go to 10, you've seen our purpose statement enabling engineering breakthroughs that lead to a better tomorrow this is a statement that everybody has really rallied around the foundry inspiration within the company.
And I've given what's going on with the coronavirus and the vaccine, Slide 11, is probably a great highlight of our purpose and action and just how essential we are to the vaccine value chain.
If you move to Slide 12, my last slide from my opening comments, I want to focus on our strategy to grow faster in the market and our proxy for the market is global industrial production growth, which is GIPI, that acronym.
So on the left hand side, it's a series of portfolio things that you've seen us make transforming the portfolio company buying three great companies, $3 billion of acquired revenue we're all accretive on growth, cash margins.
And a matter of fact, as an example, LORD grew mid-single digits last quarter, while the rest of the company, total company grew minus 6%.
And what's interesting about this list with the exception of international distribution, these are all new with Win Strategy 3.0.
The output of what we're trying to do here is that we want our PBI context the percent of sales to grow by 600 basis points over the next five years and more innovative portfolio, better chances to grow, better margins etc.
It's a speed initiative, it's a cost initiative, it's a customer experience initiative, it's a recognition that 70% of your costs are tied up on how you design a product and Simply by Design is all about focusing on design excellence.
International Distribution is going to continue from the success we've had with 2.0.
I'd like to direct everyone to Slide 14, and I'll just begin summarizing our strong second quarter results.
We generated $3.44 this quarter and that compares to $2.98 last year.
If you look at the breakdown of adjustments for the FY '22 or excuse me FY '21, as reported numbers it netted to $0.03 this quarter, and that is made up in the following buckets, business realignment expenses of $0.14, integration cost to achieve of $0.02, acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.62, and as we communicated last quarter, we are adjusting out the gain on the sale of land that amounted to $0.77.
And all-in the net tax impact of all of those adjustments, is $0.02.
Last year, our second quarter earnings per share were adjusted by $1.41, the details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures.
If you move to Slide 15, this is just a walk from the $2.98 to the $3.44 for the quarter and despite organic sales declining 6% and total sales declining 2.5%, adjusted segment operating income increased by $70 million or $0.11, that equated to $0.42 per share,so very strong operating beat for the quarter.
If you continue on the slide, we had a slight headwind from higher corporate G&A just $0.02, that was a result of market-based adjustments to investment tied to deferred comp.
And as Tom mentioned, our strong cash flow allowed us to pay off a significant portion of debt on a year-over-year basis that reduced our interest expense, that equated to $0.12 for the quarter.
And then if you look at the remaining items, other expense was just $0.01, slightly higher, we had a higher effective tax rate that impacted us by $0.03 and finally slightly higher diluted shares resulted in a $0.02 impact, that's how we get to the $3.44.
If you move to Slide 16.
So if you look at this, our second quarter discretionary savings exceeded our forecast and now amount to $190 million on a year-to-date basis.
We are now forecasting for the full year that discretionary total will increase to $225 million or an increase of $50 million.
The majority of that increase was recognized in the second quarter and roughly amounted to $35 million above our forecast.
There is no changes to what we have communicated previously, our full-year forecast will generate savings of $250 million and that will be $210 million incremental.
If we move to Slide 17, this is just a walk of the total results for the company's our sales and segment operating margin, and as Tom mentioned, organic sales did decline by 6.1% this year.
The decline was partially offset by the contributions from acquisitions, that was 2.6% and currency impact of 1%.
And again, despite these lower sales, total adjusted segment operating margins improved to 20.4% versus 17.9% last year.
This 250 basis point improvement reflects all the positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives, the hard work and dedication to cost containment and productivity improvements, as well as savings from those realignment activities, I just spoke off and really performance of the recent acquisition.
If we jump into the segments, if you go to Slide 18, looking at Diversified Industrial North America, sales there declined by 5.9%, acquisitions were a plus of 3.1% and currency-only slightly negatively impacted sales.
But again, even with these lower sales our operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis increased sizably to 21.3%, last year it was 18.2%.
So again another impressive 310 basis point improvement, focused on our long-term initiatives around Win Strategy along with the productivity improvements, diligent cost containment actions and really some increased synergies we're seeing out of the LORD acquisitions.
So if we go to the next slide, Slide 19, for Diversified Industrial International, organic sales for the quarter increased by 3.1%, acquisitions added 3.2% and currency accounted for 3.5%, again strong operating performance here, for the quarter, we reached 20.3% of sales versus 16% in the prior year.
If we go to Slide 20, and talk about Aerospace Systems' Segment.
And again, what we'll see here is a decline of 20.9% for the quarter, acquisitions helped us by 0.4%, and again, a small currency impact of 0.1% really declines in the commercial business is both in the OEM and aftermarkets and markets were the main impact, these were partially offset by higher sales in both military OEM and military aftermarket sales.
Operating margins for the second quarter was 18% versus last year's 20.2%, this resulted in a detrimental margin of 28.8%, which is in line with our expectations, and really the result of all the previous actions we've taken to realign the Aerospace business to current market conditions, along with strong cost controls and really helping to offset the pandemic imposed to the mix that we're seeing from the commercial and military businesses.
Slide 21, is just some highlights on cash flow.
Tom already mentioned this, but our operating cash flow activities increased 64% year-over-year to a record of $1.35 billion of cash, this is an impressive 20.4% of sales.
If you look at free cash flow, year-to-date, we now move to 19%, that's an increase of 78% versus prior year and our cash flow conversion is now 164% versus 130% last year.
If we want to just focus on orders, real quick moving to Slide 22, our orders came in at flat this year or this quarter I should say and that was really driven by plus 1% and our Industrial North American businesses plus 10% in our Diversified Industrial businesses and minus 18% on a 12 month basis in Aerospace.
If we move to Slide 23, in the guidance, obviously, we have a pretty large guidance increase.
And based on the strong performance we just spoke off in the first half, all the current indicators that we see right now we have increased our total outlook for sales to a year-over-year increase of 1.7% at the midpoint,this includes the forecasted organic decline of 3.4%, offset by increases from acquisitions of 2.9% and currency of 2.2%.
In respect to margins, for adjusted operating margins by segment, at the midpoint we are now forecasting to increase margins 150 basis points year-over-year and that range is expected to be 20.2% to 20.4% for the full year.
And if you note for items below segment operating income, there is a fairly significant difference between the as reported estimate of $388 million and the adjusted forecast of $487 million.
The difference is that land sale that we spoke about that's $101 million pre-tax, $76 million after-tax that was recognized as other income in Q2.
Full-year effective tax rate, no change, we still expect that to be 23%, and for the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as reported basis is now $11.90 to $12.40 or $12.15 at the midpoint and on an adjusted per share basis, the guidance range is now $13.65 to $14.15 or $13.90, at the midpoint.
Adjustments to the as reported forecast made in this guidance at a pre-tax level include business realignment expenses of approximately $60 million for the year associated with savings projected from those actions to be $50 million in the current year, and acquisition and integration cost to achieve $50 million of expense.
Synergy savings for the lower acquisition are now projected to reach $100 million, that is an increase of $20 million from our prior stated numbers of $80 million and that is included in our guidance.
Exotic synergies remain are expected to be $2 million for the full year.
Just a reminder, acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense is forecasted to be $322 million for the year, and some assumptions that we have baked into the guidance here, at the midpoint, our sales are divided 48% first half 52% second half, and both, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted earnings per share is split 47% first half, 53% second half.
For the third quarter of FY '21, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per share to be $3.54 at the midpoint and that excludes $0.57 or $97 million of acquisition-related amortization expense, the business realignment expense and integration cost, we achieved in the quarter.
So if you look at -- move to Slide 24, this is really just the walk from our previous guide to our revised guide.
We had guided at $12 per share last quarter based on the strong second quarter performance, we exceeded our estimates by a $1.6 and we've mentioned this, but the improving demand environment along with the strong operational performance, some additional extended discretionary savings, the permanent restructuring savings, and increased LORD synergies, we feel confident in raising our forecasted margins, which at $0.85 of segment operating income over the next two quarters for the remainder of the fiscal year.
This calculated to an estimated incremental margin of 41% for the second half and then some other minor adjustments to the below segment operating income lines are a negative impact of $0.01 and that's a net of interest expense and income tax.
So that's how we get to the $13.90.
That is approximately a 60% increase from our prior guidance.
We talked about the portfolio, it's a big competitive advantage of us at connectivity, the transformation on those three acquisitions is a fact that they're outgrowing and generating more cash and margins on legacy Parker, our performance over the cycle, but we're just reflecting the last 5 years and just use round numbers, our margins are up 500 basis points.
And then our Win Strategy 3.0 in particular in the Purpose Statement are going to be the powerhouse behind accelerating our performance intoo the future.
