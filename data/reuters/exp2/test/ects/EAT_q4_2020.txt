We continued this momentum into July, ending the month with Chili's down just 10.9%.
And in the 84% of our company-owned restaurants with open dining rooms were down just 3.8%, and 36% of our company-owned Chili's restaurants ran positive comp sales for the month.
We can lean into our 8 million member loyalty database, gain check-level purchasing insight from our tabletop devices and continue to improve our five-Star app with features like one-tap reorder of our guests most frequent-ordered items.
And as a result, our digital sales of off-premise meals have grown from low teens to more than 50% in the fourth quarter with only a slight dip as dining rooms reopen.
In a single day, we launched It's Just Wings, our first virtual brand, in 1,050 Chili's and Maggiano's across the country.
Sales continue to build every week, and we clearly see the potential to exceed $150 million in the brand's first year, which would secure It's Just wings a spot in the top 200 restaurant brands.
We created this business in six months and launched it overnight with minimal investment in a consumer channel where demand is growing by more than 100% annually.
For the fourth quarter of FY '20, Brinker reported consolidated net comp sales of negative 36.7%, although comp sales recorded material improvement as the quarter progressed with the June period consolidated results down 19%.
While the reported quarterly net comp sales for the brand was a negative 32.2%, performance progressed from down 51% in April at the height of the dining room closures to down only 13% for the June period.
Chili's outpaced the competition throughout the quarter with comp sales positive the casual dining sector by approximately 13% and traffic positive to the sector by approximately 18%.
More than 25% of our corporate Chili's restaurants reported positive comp sales for the June period, a percentage, as Wyman earlier stated, that increased to 36% in July.
Our P&L highlights for the quarter were total revenues of $563 million, a restaurant operating margin of 6.4% and an adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.88.
Included in the $0.88 loss is a burden of approximately $0.18 due to the timing of recording expenses related to annual and long-term incentive compensation plans beyond what would typically be recorded in the fourth quarter in our G&A expense.
Hourly labor and payroll tax have a good degree of variability and were favorable year over year, although total labor, including restaurant management, was unfavorable in the quarter by 260 basis points driven by sales deleverage.
Restaurant expense margin for the quarter increased by 6.2%, again primarily due to sales deleverage.
Despite our operators reducing year-over-year spend in this area by more than $29 million, we recorded meaningful savings in advertising spend, repair and maintenance and supplies related to on-premise dining, a portion of which we believe will be ongoing.
As to cost of sales, we were positive 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to favorable menu mix.
By earlier commented, our restaurant operating margin from the quarter was 6.4%.
However, in conjunction with the progress we made, top line, our operating margin improved through the quarter, increasing to 12.2% for the June period.
To further enhance our liquidity position, we executed an equity offering in the quarter, raising approximately $139 million, which was used to pay down revolving credit debt.
Our overall total debt balance at fiscal year end was approximately $1.2 billion, a reduction of just over $220 million from the end of the third quarter as revolving credit borrowings decreased from $700 million to less than $473 million.
Our liquidity, which we consider to be cash balances and revolving credit availability, now exceeds $575 million.
In addition, we recently completed a 15-month extension of our revolving credit facility now maturing in December 2022.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share are currently estimated to be a loss in the range of $0.25 to $0.40.
We anticipate positive operating cash flow, and weighted average shares is estimated to be 45 million to 46 million shares.
