Through the first six months of 2021, we experienced $50 million of adverse prior year's loss reserve development, compared to $2 million a year ago.
The lower current accident year loss ratio this year was due to a two-point reduction from natural cat events with $25 million or five points from the losses on Winterstorm Uri this year, and $32 million or seven points of losses from COVID-19 last year and a two-point reduction in the attritional loss ratio due to the reduction in the loss ratio in our property lines.
