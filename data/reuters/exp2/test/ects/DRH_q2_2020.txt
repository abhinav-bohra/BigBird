Contemporaneously, the concerns over systematic bias in our society led to demonstrations across the United States involving an estimated 15 million to 25 million people.
According to F.W. Dodge, rolling three-month hotel construction starts were down 56% in June as compared to the prior year.
Moreover, last quarter, we suggested as much as 10% of the existing supply in Midtown East, New York, may not reopen.
In response to travel demand declining by over 90%, we suspended operations at 20 of our 30 operating hotels, leaving just 10 hotels open at one point in April.
The quick action taken by the team allowed us to realize a 72% reduction in hotel-level expenses excluding wage of benefit accruals.
Impressively, compared to the prior year, second quarter man hours decreased 83% at open hotels and 99% at hotels with suspended operations.
And ultimately, we reopened a total of 12 additional hotels in the second quarter.
The 22 hotels we had opened at the end of the quarter represent 58% of our hotel rooms.
But since the openings were staggered, the math works such that just 43% of our rooms were available in the quarter.
Weekly occupancy for our operating hotels, which had bottomed at 6.8% at the end of March, rose steadily to 27.8% by the last week in June.
This trend has continued beyond Q2 with occupancy for operating hotels in July over 200 basis points higher than the full month of June.
In April, five hotels achieved breakeven profitability on a GOP basis, and this figure grew to seven hotels in May and 10 hotels in June.
From early May to the end of June, weekend occupancy at our resorts increased from 11% to nearly 56%, with healthy gains in ADR for the majority of the weeks.
For the second quarter, leisure transient ADR was 1.6% higher than in the second quarter of 2019.
The Shorebreak in Surf City Huntington Beach averaged nearly 50% occupancy in July.
Our L'Auberge de Sedona, Orchards Inn and Havana Cabana Key West, each ran occupancy over 60%.
L'Auberge actually had an average rate in July of $553, which was a 14% increase over the prior year.
But our little star of the month was Landing in Lake Tahoe, which had 80% occupancy in July with average rate up nearly $100 a night to over $519.
In April, the weakest month of the quarter, we saw less than $400,000 of revenue from business transient channels, but this grew to $1 million in May and $2.5 million in June.
Since the start of the COVID impact and through the second quarter, our portfolio experienced approximately $117 million of canceled group revenue.
Over 80% of these cancellations occurred in March and April.
The pace of cancellations was initially as high as $20 million per week in March, but has since slowed to just $2 million to $3 million per week.
However, it was encouraging to see 250,000 to 350,000 room nights of group leads generated each month during the second quarter.
Total revenue decreased 92.1% in second quarter 2020 as a result of a 92.8% decline in RevPAR.
Total revenues were $3.3 million in April with 10 hotels open, $5.7 million in May with 12 hotels open and $10.9 million in June with 22 hotels open.
Excluding the Sonoma Renaissance, which opened July 1, the same 22 hotels are on pace for nearly $13 million of revenue in July.
As Mark mentioned, we decreased hotel-level operating expenses 72% from $170 million to approximately $48 million, excluding nearly $3 million of accrued benefits for furloughed employees.
We were able to slash variable expenses by 80%.
It is critical to understand that we achieved this level of cost reduction despite over 70% of our hotels partially open during the quarter.
Hotel adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was negative $30.4 million.
Corporate adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was negative $37 million.
Finally, second quarter adjusted FFO per share was negative $0.20.
For CapEx, we have canceled or delayed over 65% of our original capital expenditure plans.
In the second quarter, we restricted capex spending to only $20.7 million, including $8.5 million for Frenchman's Reef to put the project in a position where we could pause work.
In this regard, we spent $4.5 million to complete the F&B repositioning initiatives at our Renaissance hotels in Sonoma, Worthington and Charleston as well as the JW Marriott Cherry Creek.
We expect these investments will be earnings contributors in 2021, and the average IRR is forecast to be over 30%.
At the end of the quarter, we have $364 million of total liquidity between corporate and hotel level cash and undrawn revolver availability.
At the hotel operating level, we averaged a $10.1 million monthly loss in the quarter, surpassing our initial forecast by 16%.
Including corporate G&A, the average monthly loss was approximately $12 million or 12% ahead of our expectation.
Finally, our total burn rate, including debt service, was approximately $17 million.
Compared to our average pace in second quarter 2020, we expect our burn rate will improve slightly in July, mainly because we had 58% of our rooms open at the end of June as compared to only 43% during the quarter.
Our preliminary estimate for our hotel-level cash burn in July is approximately $9 million to $10 million, which is potentially $1 million or 10% lower than the average monthly pace seen in the second quarter.
Including cash, G&A and debt service, this works out to an overall burn rate of $16 million to $17 million and provides a runway before capex of up to 23 months based upon our total liquidity of $364 million at the end of the quarter.
For example, net debt to undepreciated book value as of second quarter 2020 was just 26%.
We ended the second quarter with net debt of only $106,000 per key on a portfolio with a replacement cost in the range of $450,000 per key.
This implies a net debt to replacement cost of less than 24%.
At the end of the quarter, we had $605 million of nonrecourse mortgage debt at a weighted average interest rate of 4.1%.
We had $550 million of bank debt, comprised of $400 million in unsecured term loans and just under $149 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility.
Collectively, we have $110 million for capital investment, which has proved to be one of the largest capital investment allowances relative to assets or pre-COVID EBITDA.
We have no limitation on our ability to pursue equity funded unencumbered acquisitions, and our $300 million limitation on encumbered acquisitions is proportionately larger than the limitation many peers have on total acquisitions.
We have no maturities in 2021, and we have only one loan for $48 million due in 2022 and even that can be extended to 2023 under certain conditions.
Encouragingly, there are already 30 vaccines in human trial.
We have 13 of 31 hotels that are leisure oriented.
According to STR, hotels under 300 rooms have shown the best relative performance.
Due to our focus on boutiques and drive to resorts, the median hotel in DiamondRock's portfolio is just 265 rooms.
Three, the portfolio has numerous ROI projects, many with 30% plus IRRs.
We have great assets, a solid balance sheet, strong industry relationships and an experienced management team that has weathered numerous prior downturns over the last 30 years.
