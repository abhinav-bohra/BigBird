We continue to be pleased with the financial strength of our customer base, with our average annual household incomes of $164,000.
Data suggests that only 4% of workers making more than $150,000 a year, have recently lost their jobs, compared to the low-teens for lower income categories.
We have collected about 97% of our residential rents during the second quarter and attribute this to a customer base that remains well-employed and capable of meeting their obligations, July is trending similarly.
And while our 90 basis point decline in same store residential revenue was our first quarterly revenue decline in 10 years, our residential business held up reasonably well under very trying circumstances.
We also believe that we have stabilized our physical occupancy at 95%.
The Cambridge asset is a 64-unit property, adjacent to an existing asset of ours and was built for $47 million and stabilize at approximately 5% yield on cost.
This property complements our large existing Cambridge portfolio of six properties with about a 1,100 units and is ideally suited to house the biotech employees working in that area.
The other property consists of 137 units and is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle and cost $65 million to build.
It stabilized at about a 5% yield on cost.
In terms of transactions, we're pleased to close on two dispositions during the quarter and have sold more than $750 million in assets during 2020.
We feel that we received strong pricing on this quarter sales, as both sold assets were over 50 years old and our combined disposition yield was 4.4%.
Our current portfolio mix stands at about 55% urban and 45% suburban.
Our collection rate remained strong and fairly stable throughout the quarter, with a little over 97% being collected.
They focused on retaining existing residents, as evidenced by turnover at 11.8% for the quarter, which is a 130 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019.
This was driven by a 10% reduction in move-outs during the quarter as more residents opted to stay in place.
Achieved renewal rate increases were positive 70 basis points for the quarter, but we expect this number to trend lower as negotiations become more challenging.
Right now about 20% of our renewal offers for July and August include a slight market rate increase.
The portfolio was 95% occupied today and we average 94.9% through the quarter after recovering from a 94.2% low point in mid-May.
New lease change was down 7% this quarter for our same store portfolio, before concessions.
factoring in concessions, the net effective new lease change for the portfolio during the quarter was down 9%.
This improvement, however, was not sufficient to make up for the nearly 40% year-over-year reduction experienced in April.
As a result, the total number of move-ins for the second quarter were 20% below the second quarter of 2019.
First, our suburban assets, which represents approximately 45% of the company's portfolio, have been more resilient during the pandemic with occupancy declining to a low point of 95.2% before recovering fully to levels at or above prior year and ending the quarter at t 96.6%.
Suburban renewal percent was very strong at 65% and continues to trend well above prior year.
Second, our urban assets that are located in the city of Boston and Cambridge, Manhattan and Brooklyn and Downtown, San Francisco, which represents about 25% of the company's portfolio and is currently 91% occupied.
For the quarter, this urban portfolio renewed 58% of residents, which is 500 basis points lower than Q2 of 2019 and was trending down throughout the quarter ending at 53% in June.
Our third grouping consist of urban assets and other markets, like Washington D.C., Seattle and Southern California and consist of about 30% of our portfolio.
These assets reached the low point in occupancy of 94% in mid-May, but quickly bounce back and remained at 95.2%.
Pricing has been stable since the middle of May with rates being down year-over-year and concessions being used on about 15% of our applications.
During the quarter, 57% of residents renewed from these assets, which is 300 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019.
The Boston urban center is now 91.5% occupied and continues to be pressured on rates and occupancy, especially given the uncertainty around international students and the competitive supply being delivered.
The other submarkets in Boston have been operating at 95% with consistent rates and very little concession use.
Applications have been running at prior year levels and the portfolio is 95.8% occupied.
Concession use is widespread with about 50% of our applications receiving concessions, which now average greater than one month.
During June, we renewed 57% of our renewal offered, which is strong by all accounts, but lower than June of 2019.
We have held 95% occupancy on the Waterfront for the past month and while concessions are being used, it's at a lower level than in Manhattan.
Our New York same store portfolio, including New Jersey is about 92% occupied today.
The portfolio is 95.3% occupied today and overall revenue performance has been very consistent since early April, although, pricing decelerated slightly through what normally is the growth period of peak leasing season.
Our portfolio in this market is approximately 30% urban and 70% suburban.
L.A. is 96.1% occupied today, West L.A. remains the most challenged submarket, but even here occupancy recovered to 94.1% and the Downtown submarket, which currently has supply pressure has been stable at 95%, although rent declines are the most pronounced in this submarket.
Overall, we are seeing strength in the suburban submarkets of L.A., which is about 45% of our L.A. portfolio.
Page 16 of the release provides detailed color on specific line items.
I do want to highlight that expenses in the quarter included approximately $1 million related to one-time bonuses for our frontline workers and another $500,000 from elevated cleaning and other health and safety costs.
As evidenced by our strong 97% collection rate for the quarter, our high-quality resident continues to pay their rent.
Residential bad debt reduced revenue growth by approximately $9 million or 150 basis points in the same store portfolio.
That is about 100 basis points higher than the comparable period in 2019, which would have been a more typical level.
Turning to our non-residential business, I would remind you that the non-residential business is a small part of our overall operations at approximately 4% of revenues, historically.
Retail tenant collections were about 60% for the quarter with collections trending slightly higher in June.
If retail performance continues to be stressed, we expect that a significant portion of the straight line non-residential receivable disclosed on Page 11, could be at risk and therefore, could be written off.
