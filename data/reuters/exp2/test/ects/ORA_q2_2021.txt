For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see Risk Factors section as described in Ormat Technologies annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that are filed with the SEC.
The progress in our growth reinforces our belief that we can achieve our stated goals of increasing Ormat's combined geothermal energy storage and solar generating portfolio to more than 1.5-gigawatt by 2023.
The increased backlog and sales pipeline, along with the -- I guess the only tailwinds and significant portfolio growth coming from our Electricity and Energy Storage segment support our target of an annual run rate of more than $500 million in adjusted EBITDA toward the end of 2022.
Let me start my review of the financial results on Slide 5.
Total revenue for the second quarter were $146.4 million, down 16% from the prior year.
Second quarter 2021 consolidated gross profit was $52 million, resulting in a gross margin of 35.4%, 200 basis point lower than in the second quarter of 2020, mainly driven by the reduction in the Electricity segment.
These issues reduced our Electricity gross profit by approximately $8 million.
For the six months, gross margin was 40.1%, similar to the same period last year.
We delivered net income attributed to the company stockholders of $13 million or $0.23 in the quarter compared to $23 million or $0.45 per share for the same quarter last year.
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 22.6%, which is lower than the 33% effective tax rate from the second quarter of 2020, mainly due to the movement in the valuation allowances for each quarter.
We now expect the annual effective tax rate to stand by approximately 33% for the full-year 2021, assuming no material one-time impacts.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 13.6% to $84.5 million in the second quarter, impacted mainly by gross profit reduction and higher G&A expenses, driven by increased legal costs.
Moving to Slide 6; breaking the revenue down, Electricity segment revenues increased 4% to $134 million, supported by contribution from new added capacity at our Steamboat and McGinness Hill complexes, as well as Puna resumed operation.
In the Product segment, revenue declined 83% to $7.4 million, representing 5% of total revenue in the second quarter.
Energy storage segment revenues increased nearly 124% year-over-year to $5.6 million in the second quarter, representing 4% of our total revenue for the quarter.
Let's move to Slide 7.
Gross margin for the Electricity segment for the quarter decreased year-over-year to 37.4%.
In addition, in the second quarter last year, we did record a business interruption insurance recovery of $2.7 million related to Puna complex compared to zero this year.
In the Product segment, gross margin was 20.1% in the second quarter compared to 20.6% in the same time last year.
Turning to Slide 8.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 40% to $84.5 million in the second quarter, impacted mainly by gross profit reduction and higher G&A expenses, driven by increased legal costs.
The Electricity segment generated 94% of the total Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter and the Product segment generated 4%.
The Storage segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $2 million, which represent 2% of the total adjusted EBITDA.
On Slide 9; our net debt as of June 30, 2021, was $1.40 billion.
Cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash and cash equivalent as of June 30 was approximately $330 million compared to $537 million as of year-end.
In addition, we had $46 million of marketable securities.
Slide 9 breaks down the use of case for the six months and illustrates our ability to reinvest in the business, service debt, and return capital to our shareholders in form of cash dividends.
Our long-term debt as of June 30, 2021, was $1.4 billion, net of deferred financing costs and its payment schedule is presented on Slide 30, in the appendix.
The average cost of debt was 4.9%.
During July, we closed two new corporate loan raising approximately $175 million out of which $50 million are green bonds provided HSBC bank.
On August 4, 2021, the company Board of Directors declared approved and authorized payment of quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share pursuant to the company's dividend policy.
The dividend will be paid on September 1, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business day on August 18, 2021.
In addition, we expect to pay dividend of $0.12 per share in the next quarter.
Turning to Slide 12, for a look at our operating portfolio.
Power generation in our power plants increased by approximately 2.4% compared to last year.
We recently completed the expansion of our McGinness Hill facility and are now providing electricity for approximately 6,000 homes, while offsetting approximately 63,000 tons of CO2 emissions, delivering the highest level of efficiency and safety in the geothermal industry.
With the addition of the acquired operating assets, we are running one-gigawatt electricity portfolio, an increase of 83-megawatt in the second quarter.
As noted on Slide 13, Puna resumed operation in November 2020.
We have ramped Puna generation to approximately 28-megawatts, following the repair of a turbine, up from 20-megawatts in our last quarterly report.
We expect to reach 30-megawatts by year-end.
We have continued discussions with HELCO and the PUC about our new PPA and continue selling electricity under our existing PPA, which is in effect until the end of 2027.
Turning to Slide 14.
The combination of which has resulted in approximately a reduction of generating capacity of 25-megawatts.
This reduction in capacity reduced our quarterly gross margin by approximately $2.7 million.
We also experienced a mechanical failure at our Steamboat Complex, resulting in revenue loss and interest expenses that reduced gross margin by approximately $2 million.
Turning to Slide 15.
This acquisition added a total net generating capacity of approximately 67.5-megawatts to our portfolio.
And an underutilized transmission line capable of handling between 300-megawatts to 400-megawatts on 230-kilowatt electricity, connecting Dixie Valley to California.
With this acquisition, we now own 10 operating plants in Nevada, generating a total of 443-megawatt.
Turning to Slide 16 for an update on our backlog.
As of August 4, 2021, our product segment backlog increased 59% by $22 million to reach $59 million compared to $37 million in early May this year.
We signed a few contracts during the quarter, including a new contract with Star Energy Geothermal to supply products to a new 14- megawatt Salak geothermal power plant in Indonesia and then other contract to supply equipment to the project in Japan.
As I mentioned earlier and as discussed in Slide 17, this business continues to become a more important part of our consolidated results.
Moving to Slide 18.
One example is the recent ruling by CTC [Phonetic] require electrical load service entities LLCs to procure 11.5-gigawatt of new clean electricity by 2026.
One gigawatt of this procurement must deliver thermal power with an 80% capacity factor produce zero onsite emission and be weather- independent.
No form of renewable energy generation is more poised to fill this slate than geothermal, with a 95% capacity factor and thermal flexible generation.
California efforts to achieve its goal of 100% carbon free electricity by 2045, through massive deployment of renewable energy and energy storage resources enable us to sign new contracts for geothermal and we did this quarter with CPA for 14-megawatt Heber South geothermal power plant in the Imperial Valley, California.
We also issued our first ever request for the -- for the 26-megawatt Heber 2 and actively look for opportunities for our storage platform.
Moving to Slide 20 and 21.
This build up support of robust growth plans, which is expected to increase our total portfolio by almost 50% by the end of 2023.
Our medium-term goal in the electricity segment is to add an additional 240-megawatts to 250-megawatts by year-end 2023, above the 80-megawatts added since the beginning of 2021.
And in our rapidly growing energy storage portfolio, we plan to enhance our growth and to increase our portfolio by 200-megawatts to 300-megawatts by year-end 2022.
Achieving this growth target is expected to help us reach an annual run rate of more than $500 million in adjusted EBITDA toward the end of 2022 that we expect to continue to grow as we move forward with our plans in 2023 and onwards.
Slide 22 displays 13 projects underway that comprise the majority of our 2023 growth goals.
Moving to Slide 23 and 24, the second layer of our growth has come from the energy storage segment.
Slide 23 demonstrates the energy storage facilities, we have announced or started construction.
As you can see on Slide 24, our energy storage pipeline extends two-gigawatt and plus [Phonetic] include 36 name, potential projects, mainly in Texas, New Jersey, and California.
Moving to Slide 25, the significant growth in both our electricity and storage segment will require robust capital investment over the next couple of year.
To fund this growth, we have over $750 million of cash and available lines of credit.
Our total expected capital spend for the remainder of 2021 includes approximately $280 million for capital expenditures as detailed on Slide 31 in the appendix.
We expect total revenues between $650 million and $685 million with Electricity segment's revenues between %585 million and $595 million.
We expect Product segment revenues between $400 million and $60 million.
Guidance for Energy storage revenue are expected to be between $25 million to $30 million.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $400 million and $410 million.
We expect annual adjusted EBITDA attributable to minority interest to be approximately $31 million.
As noted in previous quarter, adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 includes insurance proceeds of approximately $10 million.
