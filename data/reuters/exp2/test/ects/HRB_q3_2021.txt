We've certified over 25,000 professionals to serve the complex tax and financial needs of small business owners.
These efforts are paying off as we grew third-quarter revenue over 30% at Wave, continuing on the path toward pre-pandemic levels.
As a result, we reported revenue of $308 million for our third quarter, a decline of 41%.
This was primarily related to the delayed return volume, while approximately $69 million was due to the deferral of tax prep fees and the delayed recognition of refund transfer fees to Q4.
Partially offsetting this decline was continued strong performance at Wave, where we posted an increase of over 30% for the second consecutive quarter.
Total operating expenses decreased 15% to $572 million.
Interest expense declined $4 million, which reflects lower draws on our line of credit, as well as a lower interest rate on our debt issuance earlier in the fiscal year.
The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $284 million.
GAAP loss per share increased from $0.66 to $1.27, while adjusted loss per share increased from $0.59 to $1.17.
Based on these expectations and the positive trends Jeff mentioned earlier, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion and EBITDA of $950 million to $1 billion.
We have identified additional favorability in corporate taxes and, as such, now expect our effective tax rate to come in at the low end of our 18% to 20% outlook range.
All in, these costs total approximately $20 million to $25 million in fiscal '21.
The health of our business and our outlook for the future have allowed us to increase the dividend in four of the last five years, amounting to a total increase of 30% during that span.

The dedication and resolve they've shown over the past 12 months are truly remarkable.
