Also note that both our adjusted results and full-year guidance exclude our build-to-print actuation product line that supported the 737 MAX program, as well as our German valves business, which was classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter.
Overall, we experienced a strong 14% increase in sales.
Our aerospace and defense markets improved 11%, while sales to our commercial markets increased 21% year-over-year.
Adjusted operating income improved 24%, while adjusted operating margins increased 120 basis points to 15.6%.
It's important to note that this strong performance was achieved while we continue to invest strategically with a $5 million incremental investment in research and development as compared to the prior year.
Based on our solid operational performance, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.56 in the second quarter, which was slightly above our expectations.
This reflects a strong 22% year-over-year growth rate, despite higher interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate, which were generally offset by the benefits of our consistent share repurchase activity.
We achieved 11% growth and generated a strong 1.1 times book-to-bill overall, as orders exceeded one-time sales within each of our three segments.
Of note, our results reflect strong commercial market orders, which serves 50% year-over-year and included a record quarter of order activity for our industrial vehicle products covering both on and off-highway markets.
Within our aerospace and defense markets, book-to-bill was 1.15.
Sales improved sharply year-over-year and this was led by a strong increase in demand of approximately 40% for industrial vehicle products to both on and off-highway markets.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2021, we expect an improved performance within this market, led by increased production of narrow-body aircraft, including the 737 and A320.
Longer term, we see narrow-body aircraft returning to prior production levels by the 2023 timeframe, while wide-body aircraft may not fully recover until 2024 or even 2025.
Adjusted operating income increased 138%, while adjusted operating margin increased 800 basis points to 15.7%, reflecting favorable absorption on higher sales and a dramatic recovery from last year's second quarter.
In the Defense Electronics segment, revenues increased 17% overall in the second quarter.
Segment operating performance included $4 million in incremental R&D investments, unfavorable mix and about $2 million in unfavorable FX.
In the Naval and Power segment, we continue to experience solid revenue growth for our naval nuclear propulsion equipment, principally supporting the CVN-80 and 81 aircraft carrier programs.
The segment's adjusted operating income increased 13%, while adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 17.2% due to favorable absorption on higher sales and the savings generated by our prior restructuring actions.
To sum up the second-quarter results, overall, adjusted operating income increased 24%, which drove margin expansion of 120 basis points year-over-year.
I'll begin with our end-market sales outlook, where we continue to expect total Curtiss-Wright sales growth of 7% to 9%, of which 2% to 4% is organic.
Starting in Naval Defense, where our updated guidance ranges from flat to up 2%, driven by expectations for slightly higher CVN-81 aircraft carrier revenues and less of an offset in the timing of Virginia-class submarine revenues.
Our outlook for overall aerospace and defense market sales growth remains at 7% to 9%, which, as a reminder, positions Curtiss-Wright to once again grow our defense revenues faster than the base DoD budget.
In our commercial markets, our overall sales growth is unchanged at 6% to 8%, though we updated the growth rates in each of our end markets.
And as a result, we are now anticipating 1% to 3% growth in this market.
Next, in the general industrial market, based on the year-to-date performance and strong growth in orders for industrial vehicle products, we've raised our growth outlook to a new range of 15% to 17%.
We now expect the segment sales to grow 3% to 5%, and we've increased this segment's operating income guidance by $3 million to reflect the higher sales volumes.
With these changes, we're now projecting segment operating income to grow 17% to 21%, while operating margin is projected to range from 15.1% to 15.3% of 180 to 200 basis points, keeping us on track to exceed 2019 profitability levels this year.
First, based upon technology pursuits in our pipeline, we now expect to make an additional $2 million of strategic investments in R&D for a total of $8 million year-over-year to fuel future organic growth.
Next, in the Naval and Power segment, our guidance remains unchanged and we continue to expect 20 to 30 basis points of margin expansion on solid sales growth.
So, to summarize our full-year outlook, we expect 2021 adjusted operating income to grow 9% to 12% overall on 7% to 9% increase in total sales.
Operating margin is now expected to improve 40 to 50 basis points to 16.7% to 16.8%, reflecting strong profitability, as well as the benefits of our prior-year restructuring and ongoing companywide operational excellence initiatives.
Continuing with our 2021 financial outlook, where we have again increased our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance, at this time to a new range of $7.15 to $7.35, which reflects growth of 9% to 12%, in line with our growth in operating income.
Note that our guidance also includes the impacts of higher R&D investments, a higher tax rate, which is now projected to be 24% based upon a recent change in UK tax law and a reduction in our share count, driven by ongoing share repurchase activity.
Turning to our full-year free cash flow outlook, we've generated $31 million year to date.
And as we've seen historically, we typically generate roughly 90% or greater of our free cash flow in the second half of the year and we remain on track to achieve our full-year guidance of $330 million to $360 million.
The release reflected approximately 2% growth over the FY '21 enacted budget and was reasonably consistent with our expectations and plans.
The budget revealed continued strong support for the most critical U.S. naval platforms, including the CVN-80 and 81 aircraft carriers and the Columbia-class and Virginia-class submarines.
Despite cuts to the overall army budget, funding to upgrade Battlefield network is up 25% in the services FY '22 budget request to a total of $2.7 billion, which represents the single greatest increase among the Army's modernization priorities.
The recent vote by the Senate Armed Service Committee to authorize an additional $25 billion to the Pentagon's budget for FY '22 represents a 3% upside to the President's initial request and an overall increase of 5% above the current fiscal year.
We have good line of sight on achieving a 5% base sales growth CAGR, including PacStar, by the end of 2023.
As you saw in our updated guidance, we increased our 2021 R&D investment by another $2 million, reflecting a total of $12 million in incremental year-over-year spending.
Lastly, I wanted to reiterate that our target for a minimum earnings per share CAGR of 10% over the three-year period is likely to incorporate annual share repurchase activity above our current base level of $50 million annually.
Finally, with more management attention on M&A and a very full pipeline of opportunities, I feel very optimistic that we will have the opportunity to exceed 5% and approach the 10% sales targets as we find critical strategic acquisitions to bring into Curtiss-Wright.
We expect to generate a high single-digit growth rate in sales and 9% to 12% growth in both operating income and diluted earnings per share this year.
Our 2021 operating margin guidance now stands at 16.7% to 16.8%, including our incremental investments in R&D.
And we remain on track to continue to expand our margins to reach 17% in 2022.
