Our first quarter consolidated net sales were strong, growing 22.6% year-over-year to $347.6 million on significantly higher sales volumes.
Our gross margin expanded to 46.7% from 45.7% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower labor, factory, warehouse and shipping costs, which were partially offset by higher material costs.
Our solid gross margin, combined with our diligent expense management and reduced costs due to COVID-19, drove a significant year-over-year increase of 38.6% in our income from operations to $68.4 million and an increase of 39.8% in our earnings per diluted share to $1.16.
The increase in sales volume we experienced in the first quarter was primarily a result of the continued momentum in the home center distribution channel, where sales increased over 60% compared to the prior year period.
As we generally experience a multiple month lag in demand from the time of the start, in the first quarter, we benefited from strong fourth quarter 2020 housing starts, which grew over 10% year-over-year.
As previously announced in early February, we implemented price increases ranging from 5% to 12% depending on the product mix for certain of our wood connectors, fasteners and concrete products in the U.S. in an effort to offset rising material costs.
These price increases went into effect on April 5, following a 60-day notice period to our customers.
More recently, we announced the second price increase ranging from 6% to 12% primarily for our wood connector products in the U.S. in an effort to further offset rising material costs.
If we can accomplish this, we have no doubt we will be able to accomplish ambition Number 4, which is to continue our above-market growth relative to U.S. housing starts.
As Karen highlighted, our consolidated net sales were strong, increasing 22.6% to $347.6 million.
