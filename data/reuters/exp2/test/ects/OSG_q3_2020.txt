For a discussion of these factors, we refer you specifically to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
Our Form 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of 2020, our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2020, which we anticipate being filed later today and our other filings with the SEC, which are available at the SEC's internet site, www.
As a result, cash flow from operations continued to be strong, particularly when considering the nearly 200 revenue days lost during the quarter to plan the drydock operations.
This quarter, the vessel's operating contribution from our niche market activities provided $22 million.
With $16 million in TCE revenue earned and $8.1 million of vessel operating contribution from these assets, our ATC tankers saw utilization rates of 100% of available days during the quarter just ended.
The face of these challenges, it is gratifying to highlight that our vessels operated for 93% of the available operating days during the quarter, a testimony to the continued response of all of our employees in meeting the elevated operational challenges that we currently face.
Ethylene consumption has retreated back to levels 10% to 12% below year ago norms, and jet fuel consumption remains about 50% below year ago levels.
The EIA statistics released this past week show refining operation capacity still below 70% in PADD one and just over 75% in PADD III.
Marathon and Shell, PBF and Phillips 66 have already or will soon reduce U.S. operating refining capacity.
Before handing things over to Dick to take you through the numbers, I would like to note that our current fleet profile consists of three actively trading large crude oil tankers being operated by ATC, one conventional ATP, two lightering ATBs, three shuttle tankers, 10 MR tankers and two non-Jones Act MR tankers that participate in the U.S. Maritime security program.
Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA exceeds $104 million.
We had 193 days in which we were offhire resulting in $9.9 million in lost revenues during the quarter.
Year-over-year, TCE revenue grew 21% to $92.3 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased 35% from $16.1 million to $21.8 million.
Sequentially, TCE revenues decreased $8.1 million.
We operated 24 vessels for the full third quarter of 2020 and 19 in the third quarter of 2019.
During the quarter, we sold the OSG 244, our final rebuilt barge for scrap.
RAGS, the tug formerly coupled with the OSG 244 has completed her drydock and is in Oregon awaiting the delivery of the OSG 205.
Since the third quarter of last year, we added the three Alaskan tankers as well as the Gulf Coast, Sun Coast, Key West and the OSG 204.
The Alaskan tanker acquisitions contributed $16.2 million in TCE revenues during their second full quarter of operations.
Revenues from our Jones Act Handysize tankers decreased $8.8 million.
Effective daily rate for fixed earnings increased over $3,900 per day from last year.
TCE revenues from our four non-Jones Act tankers increased $4.8 million from last year's quarter.
Gulf Coast and Sun Coast, both of which were on long-term time charters contributed $2.9 million of the increase.
Effective day rates for fixed earnings increased slightly less than $3,000, while spot market rates were almost flat in comparison to last year.
ATB TCE revenues decreased by $0.9 million from 2019's third quarter.
The OSG 204 in its first full quarter of operations contributed all of the third quarter 2020 revenues.
Total revenue days decreased from 180 during last year's quarter to 146 in this year's quarter.
Lightering revenues decreased $2.8 million from the third quarter of 2019.
Both of our lightering ATBs were a drydock during the third quarter of 2020 for a combined 90-odd higher days.
Sequentially, TCE revenues decreased $8.1 million, principally due to a net $8.2 million increase in offhire lost revenues over the second quarter.
Jones Act Handysize tanker revenues decreased approximately $12.7 million.
The ATB operations reflect the first quarter impact from the OSG 204.
During the quarter, both the OSG 350 and 351 went through required drydocking.
And during the time, when the OSG 351 was in the shipyard, the 350 operated in the Delaware Bay to meet our service commitments.
Vessel operating contribution, which is defined as TCE revenues less vessel operating expenses and charter higher expenses increased 34.5% from Q3 '19 to $26.5 million in the current quarter.
Our Alaskan tanker provided $6.2 million of the increase.
The Jones Act tanker loss increased $2.6 million from the year ago quarter, primarily due to drydock activity.
Our niche market contribution increased $1.7 million from last year as we added the Gulf Coast and Sun Coast to our fleet.
ATB vessel operating contribution during the quarter results solely from the introduction of the OSG 204 and her initial time charter, which commenced in early July.
We will take delivery of the OSG 205 later this month, at which time she will commence for initial time charter.
Sequentially, vessel operating contribution decreased $9.8 million from Q2 2020.
Contributing to the decrease was an $8 million increase in offhire lost revenues and the Key West layup.
This was partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in contribution from our Alaskan tankers.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased $5.7 million from 18 -- from $16.1 million in the third quarter of 2019 to $21.8 million.
This was partially offset by 193 offhire days due to drydock activities in the current quarter compared to none last year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $21.8 million in the quarter compared to $29.8 million in the prior 2020 quarter.
Net loss for the third quarter of 2020 was $700,000 compared to a net loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Vessel maintenance requirements are based on the original construction date at intervals of approximately 2.5 years.
This comparative graphical detection of 2020 and 20,000 -- or 2019 drydock activities shows how active a drydock year 2020 is.
We estimate, which includes the three recently acquired Alaskan tankers that our investment will be $34.7 million in drydock expenses and $18.6 million for ballast water treatment systems in 2020.
We will experience approximately $19 million in lost revenue for the full year resulting from 392 offhire days.
Our estimate is that in total, we will experience 266 offhire days in the second half of 2020 with a related revenue loss of approximately $14 million.
The OSG 205 is scheduled to deliver in late November.
We have invested through the end of the third quarter $45.9 million in the 205.
Remaining payments including those due on delivery total $5.1 million.
We have secured a financing commitment for the OSG 205, which we expect to close in the next two weeks.
We will capture approximately $28 million of our equity currently invested in the barge.
At the beginning of the third quarter, we had total cash of $94 million, which included $20.1 million of restricted cash.
During the third quarter of 2020, we generated $22 million of adjusted EBITDA and working capital provided another $3 million of cash.
We expended $11 million in dry docking and improvements to our vessels, and we invested $16 million in new vessel construction and other capex.
We expended $24 million of cash to fully repay the loan secured by the Overseas Gulf Coast.
$20 million of that was the previously restricted cash.
We incurred $5 million in interest expense and made debt repayments of $9 million.
Result was we ended the quarter with $54 million of cash, including $100,000 of restricted cash.
Continuing our discussion of cash and liquidity as we mentioned on the previous slide, we have $54 million of cash at September 30, 2020 including $100,000, which was restricted.
Our total debt was $412 million, and this represents a decrease of $34 million in outstanding indebtedness since the end of June.
Our $325 million term loan has an annual amortization requirement of $25 million or $6.25 million per quarter.
With $374 million of equity, our net debt-to-equity ratio is 1 times.
We are thus anticipating TCE revenues of between $86 million and $90 million [Technical Issues].
These expectations aren't bad, then we will deliver a full year adjusted EBITDA of between $120 million and $125 million essentially at the high end of the full year guidance we provided in our first quarter earnings call.
In 2021, we will have committed revenue streams for the full year from the OSG 204, OSG 205 and the ATC vessels that were only partially present during 2020.
