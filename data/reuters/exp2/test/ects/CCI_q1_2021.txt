We expect this elevated level of activity to result in a year of outsized growth for Crown Castle, as we now anticipate 11% growth in AFFO per share for the full-year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%.
Beyond 2021, I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers, approximately 80,000 small cells on-air are committed in backlog, and 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top U.S. markets have positioned Crown Castle to generate growth in cash flows and dividends per share for years to come.
Building on the momentum from our recent 15-year agreement with DISH to support our nationwide 5G build-out, and our recent long-term 5G small cell agreement with Verizon to support their network deployments.
The agreement also resulted in an increase in the average remaining current contracted lease term under our Verizon site leases to approximately 10 years.
Starting with the higher growth we see in the U.S., the demand for our shared infrastructure offering across towers, small cells and fiber is tied to the robust demand for mobile data in the U.S., which continues to increase by more than 30% annually.
Because we believe the U.S. has both greater potential for growth and lower risk, we are focused on growing cash flows on our 40,000 towers by providing access to existing and new customers that are building 5G wireless network.
In the near to medium term, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 11% this year, as we translate this increasing 5G activity in the very attractive bottom-line growth.
Longer term, we believe Crown Castle provides an exciting opportunity for shareholders to potentially compound double-digit total returns over a long period of time with a high-quality dividend that currently yields 3% and that we expect to be able to grow 7% to 8% annually.
This growth included more than 9% growth from new leasing activity and contracted escalators, net of approximately 3% from non-renewals.
We also generated a $23 million increase in contribution from services when compared to the first quarter 2020, culminating in 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 20% growth in AFFO per share on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to Slide 5, we increased our full-year AFFO guidance by $40 million, reflecting a $25 million increase in expected services contribution, as a result of higher than expected tower activity levels and a $30 million reduction to interest expense following our successful recent refinancing activities partially offset by $15 million of additional labor-related costs, associated with the higher activity level.
Additionally, as Jay discussed, we entered into a long-term tower leasing agreement with Verizon, that resulted in increasing the average current lease term of our Verizon tower site leases to approximately 10 years and adding straight lined revenue of approximately $140 million in 2021.
Taking these changes into account, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $150 million higher than our previously provided 2021 outlook.
Our expectation for site rental revenue growth has increased to approximately 7%, inclusive of the expected organic contribution to site rental revenues of 6%, which remains unchanged.
With approximately 6% growth from towers approximately, 15% growth from small cells and approximately 3% growth from fiber solutions.
Focusing on investment activities, during the first quarter capital expenditures totaled $302 million including $17 million of sustaining capital expenditures, $49 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our Tower segment and $225 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our Fiber segment.
Our full-year expectation for capital expenditures remains unchanged at approximately $1.5 billion or less than $1 billion after customer capital contributions and we continue to expect to fund our discretionary investments this year with free cash flow and incremental borrowings.
Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter at approximately 5.5 times, net debt to EBITDA and expect to exit 2021 at our target leverage for approximately 5 times, based on the anticipated growth in cash flows through the balance of the year.
Looking back 5 years, to when we achieved our initial investment grade credit rating and inclusive of our recent refinancing transaction, we have increased our debt mature -- average debt maturity to nearly 10 years from just over 5 years, reduced our average borrowing costs to 3.1% from 3.8% increased our mix of fixed-rate debt to more than 90% from just under 70% and reduced our reliance on secured debt to just 15% from nearly 50%.
With limited upcoming debt maturities in the near term and more than $4 billion of undrawn capacity on revolving credit facility, we believe the balance sheet is positioned well to support our growth initiatives.
We expect to once again generate industry leading U.S. tower revenue growth this year, and we expect to generate 11% growth in AFFO per share in 2021, which provides a very attractive total return opportunity when combined with the current 3% dividend yield.
