Sequentially, backlog was down $57 million, driven by revenue recognition on Airwave and ESN, partially offset with growth in LMR products.
Software and Services backlog was up $257 million compared to last year, primarily driven by North America multiyear service contracts.
And sequentially, backlog was down $130 million, driven again primarily by the revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN.

We expect Q3 sales to be approximately up 10% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.09 and $2.14 per share.
This assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24% a year.
And for the full year, we now expect sales to be up between 9.5% and 10%, an increase from our prior guide of 8% to 9%, and we now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share between $8.88 and $8.98 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.70 to $8.80 per share.
This increased outlook incorporates the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR and assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%.
We achieved Q2 record sales, operating earnings and earnings per share, expanded operating margins, grew our video security technologies by 66% and achieved strong growth in LMR and command center software technologies as well.
Openpath is disrupting the access control industry and extends our value proposition in the $15 billion video security market.
