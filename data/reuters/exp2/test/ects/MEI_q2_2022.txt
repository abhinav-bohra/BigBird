Let's begin with the highlights on the Slide 4.
Our sales for the quarter were $296 million.
Focusing on EV, last quarter, we reported that sales into EV applications were 16% of the consolidated sales.
This quarter, EV sales were again 16% of consolidated sales.
While our debt was down, we did have an increase in net debt as we utilized a portion of our available cash to execute a $35 million share buyback in the quarter.
We have now executed half of $100 million stock buyback authorization since it was announced last March.
Then in fiscal 2023, we expect the bulk of the remaining truck program sales to roll off in the range of $90 million to $100 million.
Moving to Slide 5.
The awards identified here represent some of the key business wins in the quarter and represent $25 million in annual sales at full production.
Second quarter net sales were $295.5 million in fiscal year '22 compared to $300.8 million in fiscal year '21, a decrease of $5.3 million or 1.8%.
The year-over-year quarterly comparisons included a favorable foreign currency impact on sales of $2.8 million in the current quarter.
Sequentially, sales increased by $7.7 million or 2.7% from the first quarter of fiscal year '22.
The sales decrease was partially offset by higher sales of electric hybrid vehicle products, which amounted to 16% of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which was in line with our previous communication at electric and hybrid vehicles sales would comprise a mid-teens percentage of our fiscal year '22 consolidated sales.
Second quarter net income decreased $11.1 million to $27.5 million or $0.72 per diluted share from $38.6 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the same period last year.
Fiscal year '22 second quarter margins were 23.4% as compared to 26.9% in the second quarter of fiscal year '21.
The negative impact of supply chain disruption and higher logistics costs, including freight on the second quarter fiscal year '22 gross margin was approximately 250 basis points.
Fiscal year '22 second quarter selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 10.6% compared to 10.2% in the fiscal year '21 second quarter.
Other income net was down by $1.7 million, mainly due to lower international government assistance between the comparable quarters and increased foreign exchange losses from remeasurement.
The effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal year '22 was 16.7% as compared to 16.5% in the second quarter of fiscal year '21.
The fiscal year '22 full-year estimate, which does not include any discrete items, is estimated to be between 17% and 18%, tightening the high end of the range down from 19% to 18%.
Shifting to EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, fiscal year '22 second quarter EBITDA was $47.4 million versus $60.2 million in the same period last fiscal year.
In the second quarter of fiscal year '22, we reduced gross debt by $12.3 million, and we ended the second quarter with $177.2 million in cash.
During the first six months of fiscal year '22, net debt a non-GAAP financial measure, increased by $39 million, mainly due to the share repurchases of $42.4 million and unfavorable working capital changes, especially related to inventory, which increased by nearly $26 million due to the supply chain-related challenges.
Regarding capital allocation on March 31, we announced a $100 million share repurchase program, which we executed nearly $35 million of purchases during the second quarter of fiscal year '22.
Since the authorization's approval, we purchased nearly 50 million worth of shares at an average price of $44.04.
For the fiscal year '22 second quarter, free cash flow was $21.6 million compared to $36.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year '21.
In the second quarter of fiscal year '22, we invested approximately $5.4 million in capex as compared to $3.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal year '21.
We now estimate fiscal year '22 capex to be in the $45 million to $50 million range, which is lower than the prior estimates for the current fiscal year of $50 million to $55 million we provide earlier.
The revenue range for full fiscal year '22 is between $1.14 billion and $1.16 billion, down from a range of $1.175 billion to $1.235 billion.
Diluted earnings per share range is now between $3 per share and $3.20 per share, down from $3.35 to $3.75 per share.
