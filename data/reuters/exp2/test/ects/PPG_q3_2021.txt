For the third quarter, we achieved record net sales of nearly $4.4 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $1.69.
Our raw material costs in the quarter inflated by about 25% year-over-year.
For context, this is about 3 times higher than any previous coatings raw material inflation peak in recent history.
In aggregate, our selling price realization is about 6%, with more than 6% price realization in our Industrial reporting segment.
Coming into the quarter, we expect that the supply chain and customer production disruptions would impact our sales by about $150 million.
However, this actual impact was more than $350 million.
To put the automotive OEM situation in perspective, US dealer inventories had record historic lows in the mid-20-day range.
And in 2021, global production in this industry is expected to be about 20% below prior peak levels.
Our PPG-Comex business achieved record third quarter sales with year-over-year organic sales growth of more than 10%.
In addition, our US Architectural Coatings business delivered about 10% same-store sales growth as we continue to expand our customer base with many new wins and increase our digital sales as a percentage of our total sales base.
We remain focused on cost management, which is evidenced by our SG&A as a percent of sales being 100 basis points lower than the third quarter 2020.
This is being supported by our ongoing execution on our structural cost savings programs as we delivered an incremental $35 million of savings in the third quarter.
We continue to target and on track for a full year 2021 savings of about $135 million.
We continue to expect them to deliver an aggregate of $25 million of synergies for the full year of 2021.
We once again delivered strong operating cash flow during the quarter and had about $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the quarter end, including sequential reduction of our net debt by about $400 million.
Also during the quarter, in support of further enhancing our ESG program, we were happy to announce an agreement with Constellation Energy to power our Carrollton, Texas manufacturing facility with 100% renewable solar energy.
In addition, I'm extremely pleased to announce that yesterday, PPG earned three R&D 100 awards for 2021.
The R&D World Magazine honors the 100 most innovative technologies and services over the past year with the R&D 100 awards.
Our estimate is that our sales are expected to be unfavorably impacted by about $250 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter, both for the semiconductor chip shortage issue and chronic supplier operational capabilities.
Recent production curtailments in China may add incremental pressures to availability and inflation, and we expect our inflation to approach 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Specifically, we expect continued recovery in automotive refinish, OEM and aerospace coatings, which collectively account for about 40% of our pre-pandemic sales where we have broad global businesses supported by advantaged technology.
