Our March double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins for water and flowback is north of 25% adjusted EBITDA margins for our completion fluids segment gives us good confidence in a strong second quarter and into the rest of the year.
Focusing on the first quarter, we achieved several key milestones, including successfully executing the deconsolidation of CSI Compressco, where we generated over $30 million of cash while retaining an 11% interest.
We reduced our term loan from $220 million to $184 million.
In addition to those operational achievements, we continue to advance several of our low carbon initiatives that are currently advancing faster than what we had anticipated just 90 days ago.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $9 million, we estimated the impact of the historical winter storms during February negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $3.1 million.
Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter included $4 million of gains on the higher equity values of our holdings in CSI Compressco and Standard Lithium.
We generated $5.4 million of adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations and it was normally a challenging quarter for cash flow generation due to the first quarter payments that are traditionally made early in the year and a ramp-up in inventory for our European chemicals second-quarter peak season.
We ended the first quarter with liquidity of $81 million, despite paying down our term loan to $184 million.
Despite the softness in our international and offshore business, completion fluids and products' first-quarter revenue increased 5% sequentially, driven by increased industrial chemical sales as a result of the winter weather conditions and improving U.S. land oil and gas demand.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.4 million due to the mix of higher U.S. land oil and gas sales and lower sales for higher-margin offshore international markets.
This segment was also negatively impacted by $800,000 from the winter storms as our chemical supply chain was disrupted and many plants and operations were shut down.
Adjusted EBITDA margins for the first quarter were 23.7%, the eighth straight quarter above 20% EBITDA margins.
We exited the first quarter with adjusted EBITDA margins above 25% and expect this to continue into the second quarter.
The second quarter will also see the benefit of our seasonally high Northern Europe industrial business that has historically seen revenue increase by approximately $15 million compared to the first quarter.
We estimate that the storms negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $2.3 million.
The number of integrated projects in the quarter increased from 35 in the fourth quarter of 2020 to a record-high 47 projects with 22 different customers.
We are pleased to partner with CarbonFree and utilize our nearly 40 years of calcium chloride chemistry technical expertise and global footprint.
We also have leases that cover over 30,000 acres in Arkansas with estimated bromine resources of 3.9 million tons and inferred lithium resources of 890,000 tons.
The underground sales value of these resources at today's market prices for bromine and lithium carbonate is over $18 billion and since both minerals play an important role in the world's electrification and energy storage, demand outlook is very promising.
Consistent with our contractual arrangement, we received an additional 400,000 shares of Standard Lithium in April.
So in addition to our Water & Flowback businesses now showing signs of a steady recovery, along with a strong position we have in the offshore Completion Fluids market with the CS Neptune upside and the predictably consistent performance of our industrial chemicals business, all of which consistently generate positive EBITDA and free cash flow, we're in advanced stages with 3 significant areas to capitalize on low carbon energy opportunities that can be transformational for TETRA.
As mentioned on the last earnings call on February 25, with the sale of the general partnership and the incentive distribution rights, and the 11 million common units of CSI Compressco on January 29, our balance sheet now completely excludes CSI Compressco.
The cash flow statement for the first quarter includes the 29 days in January that we were still the general partner.
When we report adjusted free cash flow for TETRA, we've excluded the first 29 days of January for CSI Compressco from our free cash flow.
Income from discontinued operations include $121 million gain on the CSI Compressco deconsolidation transaction.
The vast majority of this is a non-cash gain as the transaction resulted in the recapture of our carrying basis in CSI Compressco, given that we received over $150 million of distributions from Compressco and CSI Compressco, since we took them public in 2011.
As those distributions were received over the past 10 years that we were the general partner, the carrying value of our investment in CSI Compressco was reduced and therefore the transaction resulted in a recapture of the carrying value.
Into March 2021, TETRA continues to have a tax loss carryforward that will allow us to offset future U.S. pre-tax income by approximately $380 million.
Then with respect to our results in the first quarter, we incurred $6.6 million of non-recurring charges.
These charges included $2.9 million related to a cumulative adjustment for long-term compensation that was the result of the significant increase that we saw in our stock price in the first quarter, also includes $2.4 million of transaction and other expenses, mainly related to the CSI Compressco deconsolidation, $0.5 million of stock appreciation right expense, $300,000 of restructuring costs and $300,000 of stock warrant fair value adjustment expense.
Our first quarter companywide SG&A cost adjusted for unusual items was down 2% sequentially, compared to the 2% increase in revenue and was 23% lower than a year ago.
Our first-quarter results also included a $4 million gain on the mark-to-market adjustments to the 11% ownership that we have on CSI Compressco and to the 1% ownership or 1.2 million shares that we own of Standard Lithium.
We reduced net debt from $133 million at the end of 2020 to $117 million at the end of the first quarter.
First-quarter adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations was $5.4 million, almost $1 million above the first quarter of the year ago.
As a result of last year's streak -- strong free cash flow of $59 million and this year's first-quarter free cash flow plus the proceeds we received in the CSI Compressco transactions, we have reduced our term loan from $220 million at September 30, 2020, to $184 million at the end of March 2021.
The $36 million reduction in the term loan will save us $2.6 million of interest expense on an annual basis.
And as a reminder, our term loan does not mature until the year 2025.
The seasonality of our Northern Europe industrial chemicals business, where we typically see about a $15 million, 1-5, sequential increase in revenue and the price increases we are getting in addition to continued deployment of our SandStorm technology.
Last item I'll mention is the Russell 2000.
I previously mentioned that the decline in our share price last year resulted in TETRA being dropped from the Russell 2000.
When we were dropped in the Russell 2000, we saw lot of passive index-based funds exit their position in TETRA, putting even further downward pressure on our stock last year.
The Russell 2000 has reconstituted every June.
We believe that the cut-off to be part of the Russell 2000 this year will be somewhere between 265 and $270 million.
Our market cap as of the close of business yesterday was $315 million.
This Friday is the first listing of the companies that might be part of the Russell 2000, which has been updated every Friday in June.
If TETRA is added back to the Russell 2000, there is a possibility that we will be seeing passive index-based funds adding TETRA back to their portfolio as many mimic their holdings to match the Russell 2000.
I encourage you to visit the Russell 2000 website for updates.
Additionally, we will file our 10-Q with the SEC before the end of the day today.
