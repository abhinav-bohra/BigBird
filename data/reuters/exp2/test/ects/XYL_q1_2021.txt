For 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be at 90 to 140 basis points to a range of 17.2% to 17.7%.
For your convenience, we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here, which we now expect to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%, up 120 to 170 basis points.
Benefits from restructuring savings remain unchanged, and this yields an adjusted earnings per share range of $2.50 to $2.70, an increase of 21% to 31% over last year.
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of between 80% to 90%, as previously guided, putting our three-year average right around 130%.

We expect second-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16.7% to 17.2%, representing 140 to 190 basis points of expansion versus the prior year.
