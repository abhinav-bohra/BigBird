By April, our year-over-year revenue decline had a level of 42%.
In April, we unveiled a plan to reduce 2020 SG&A by approximately $100 million compared to 2019, which we have exceeded.
For the full year, revenue was down 22%.
To mitigate this decrease, we reduced selling, general and administrative expense by 21%.
In addition to improving revenue trends with the fourth quarter down 12% versus 25% in the third quarter, we sustained our cost discipline to drive year-over-year growth of 25% in income from operations.
PeopleReady is our largest segment, representing 60% of trailing-12-month revenue and 73% of segment profit.
PeopleReady's revenue was down 18% during the quarter versus down 29% in Q3, and we saw intra-quarter improvement with revenue down 15% in December versus down 20% in October.
PeopleManagement is our second largest segment representing 32% of trailing-12-month revenue and 20% of segment profit.
PeopleManagement returned to growth in the fourth quarter with revenue up 5%, and intra-quarter improvement with December up 9% versus up 1% in October.
Turning to our third segment, PeopleScout, represents 9% of trailing-12-month revenue and 8% of segment profit.
Revenue was down 24% during the quarter versus down 48% in Q3.
We now have digital fill rates north of 50% and more than 26,000 clients using the app.
In Q4 2020, we filled 811,000 shifts via JobStack, representing a digital fill rate of 57%.
Our client user count ended the quarter at 26,300, up 23% versus Q4 2019.
We continue to experience an increase in worker throughput of approximately 20%.
A heavy user is a client who has 50 or more touches on JobStack per month, whether it's entering an order, rating a worker or approving time.
The growth differential between heavy users and non-users reached its peak in December with an over 30 percentage points year-over-year growth differential on a same customer basis.
For all heavy users, we doubled the mix since 2019, up from 11% of PeopleReady's business in fiscal 2019 to 24% for 2020.
Even in the middle of this downturn, year-to-date new business wins at PeopleManagement are up 20% versus the prior year, as we've secured $79 million of annualized new business wins versus $66 million in the prior year.
During the first half of 2020, we repurchased $52 million of our common stock, or 9% of our common stock outstanding, at favorable prices.
Total revenue for Q4 2020 was $519 million, representing a decline of 12%.
We posted net income of $8 million, or $0.23 per share, and adjusted net income of $11 million, or $0.33 per share.
While net income this quarter declined 8% compared to Q4 2019 in large part due to a higher effective income tax rate, income from operations was up 25%.
The Q4 year-over-year revenue decline was 13 percentage points better than the Q3 year-over-year revenue decline and Q4 SG&A was down 22% year-over-year, or down nearly twice as much as the revenue decline for the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $22 million, an increase of 4% compared to Q4 2019 and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 60 basis points.
Gross margin of 23.3% was down 190 basis points.
Our staffing businesses contributed 170 basis points of compression from pay rates increasing faster than bill rates and from sales mix largely due to the revenue growth in our PeopleManagement business, which has a lower gross margin than our PeopleReady business, which had a revenue decline.
PeopleScout contributed another 20 basis points of compression primarily due to client mix and lower volume.
Turning to SG&A expense, we delivered another quarter of strong results with expense down $28 million, or 22%.
Our effective income tax rate was 28% in Q4, which included additional expense associated with less net operating loss benefit available to carry back to prior years, due to a stronger performance in Q4.
Excluding the net operating loss adjustment, the effective income rate was 9%.
Turning to our segments, PeopleReady, our largest segment, saw an 18% decline in revenue and segment profit was down 10%.
As additional social and government mandates were enacted in December to address the COVID-19 threat, our year-over-year decline did not improve much, but held relatively steady and this trend has continued into January where revenue was down 18%.
PeopleManagement saw 5% growth in revenue and segment profit was up 104%.
PeopleManagement experienced encouraging intra-quarter revenue improvement, with December up 9%, compared to 1% in October.
Revenue growth continued into January with PeopleManagement up 5%.
Turning to PeopleScout, we saw a 24% decline in revenue and segment profit was down 18%.
Temporary project work provided 6 percentage points of revenue benefit.
As Patrick noted, PeopleScout results were adversely impacted by exposure to travel and leisure clients, which made up roughly 28% of the prior year mix, and revenue for this vertical was down 54%.
We finished the year with $63 million in cash, no outstanding debt, and an unused credit facility.
Cash flow from operations in 2020 was $153 million, up from $94 million in the prior year, with the increase coming largely from the deleveraging of accounts receivable.
It was also a strong quarter for us from a working capital perspective with Days Sales Outstanding at 49 days or down 3.5 days in comparison with Q4 last year.
For the first quarter of 2021, we expect gross margin contraction of 290 basis points to 250 basis points and for the full year contraction of 50 basis points to 10 basis points.
As a reminder, in Q1 2020, there was 130 basis points of gross margin expansion from healthcare benefits that were excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA.
For the full year 2020, there was 20 basis points of net benefit from the healthcare benefit I mentioned, less workforce reduction costs that were excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA.
For the first quarter of 2021, we expect a year-over-year SG&A reduction of $13 million to $17 million.
For capital expenditures, we expect about $16 million for the first quarter and $37 million to $41 million for full year 2021.
These figures include approximately $8 million and $10 million for Q1 and 2021, respectively, in build-out costs for our Chicago support center, of which $7 million will be reimbursed by our landlord with $6 million of the reimbursements expected in the first quarter.
Our outlook for fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter of 2021 is 35.3 million.
We expect our effective income tax rate for the full year 2021, before job tax credits, to be about 23% to 27%, and we expect total job tax credits to be $8 million to $10 million.
