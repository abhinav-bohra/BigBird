So I noted in our call 90 days ago, our Q3 call, that we would do more to support the global community and local healthcare systems with ventilators and ventilation mask systems across the 140 countries that we serve.
During Q4, during this June quarter, we produced around 100,000 invasive and noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel positive pressure ventilators.
That brings our cumulative total to over 150,000 ventilators that we produced since the beginning of calendar year 2020.
And in fact, if you take the period from January 1 to June 30, for 2020, that is a 3.5 times increase over the period for 2019, so 3.5 times.
So over the portfolio of 140 countries that we serve, we expect a gradual, sequential, quarter to quarter, U-shaped recovery of patient flow to primary care physicians, sleep physicians, as well as pulmonary physicians that are treating COPD and asthma throughout fiscal year 2021.
I'll also recap our long-term strategy, our ResMed 2025 strategy and some execution highlights against some of our key operating priorities as part of that strategy.
These are three key elements of our ResMed 2025 strategy that were in play well before the global pandemic.
We had year on year annual 15% top line revenue growth to $3 billion in annual revenue for ResMed.
During fiscal year 2020, we generated $802 million of cash that allowed us to return $225 million of cash dividends to you, our shareholders, while also investing in our future with a double-digit increase in R&D, including clinical research, both digital and in person, as well as design and digital innovation across our sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and our software as a service businesses.
We have a full pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium- and long-term growth opportunities, with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio of over 6,000 patents and designs.
We now have over 6.5 billion nights of sleep and respiratory medical data in the air solutions platform.
We have grown connectivity to our digital health ecosystem by over 26% this fiscal year, and we now have over 12 million 100% cloud-connectable medical devices in the market.
And we have around 14 million patients enrolled in the AirView software solution.
During the last 12 months, we have improved 16 million lives by providing a person with a device or complete mask system to help them breathe.
Importantly, the ability to help these patients on their individual journey to better sleep and better breathing is powered by the over 6.5 billion nights of medical data in our ecosystem.
Globally, there are 936 million people with sleep apnea.
There are over 380 million people who suffer from COPD, and there are over 340 million people living with asthma.
Our SaaS business is 100% focused on out-of-hospital care, leveraging the global trend for seniors to age in place.
These three trends, the increased importance of respiratory medicine, the increased importance of digital health and the increased importance of out-of-hospital healthcare will help ResMed achieve our goal to improve 250 million lives by 2025.
1 is to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses across global markets.
With over 1.6 billion people across these three chronic disease states, we know that delivering our innovative solutions to these underpenetrated markets is our clear No.
2 priority is to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices, as well as digital health technology solutions to better engage physicians, providers and payers, as well as patients so that we can improve clinical outcomes so we can reduce costs, and we can enhance the patient experience.
3 priority is to innovate and grow the world's best seamless software solutions for care that is delivered outside the hospital.
For instance, today, in Germany, we stand at more than 85% of pre-COVID sleep lab capacity already up and running.
Whereas in China, at the other end of the spectrum, we stand at 50% of pre-COVID diagnostic capacity in that geography.
Most of the other 140 countries that we sell into around the world fall somewhere between those two extremes.
In big countries like the US, it's a story of 50 states with unique models, again, as a spectrum between these boundary conditions.
The average in the United States is probably somewhere in that 70% of diagnostic capability but some states will be closer to the 60% range, and some will be closer to the 75% range.
This new Novartis partnership follows our announcement in May that the propeller sensor and an app gained 510(k) US 510(k) clearance for use with the SYMBICORT inhaler for both asthma and COPD patients from AstraZeneca.
These new partnerships with both Novartis and AstraZeneca and previously announced collaborations with Orion, as well as Boehringer Ingelheim expand the potential reach of propeller's technology to around 90% of inhaled medicines for both asthma and COPD in the United States.
During the quarter, our software-as-a-service business grew 7% compared to the year ago period.
So before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to express my personal gratitude to the 7,500 ResMedians around the world.
You helped us pivot and produce 150,000 life-saving ventilators to help people breathe in 140 countries worldwide.
