This is a company that is focused on continuing to grow adjusted EBITDA and coupling that with balanced capital management to deliver more than $10 of earnings per share in the near future.
2021 is expected to be a solid result for Olin for the reasons shown on Slide number 3.
The reason thematic for better results in 2022 is shown on Slide number 4.
Even though we have grown our earnings for five consecutive quarters and delivered a levered free cash flow that is approaching 20%, we still must show that our performance will continue to improve, but maybe more importantly, we must demonstrate our ability to manage uncertainty and volatility.
Slide number 5 has an illustration.
Continuing with the theme of good fundamentals on Slide number 6, our perceived old world chemistry has new world application and value.
I won't read all of these mega trend multipliers, as I'm sure they're familiar to you, but instead jump to Slide number 7 and hit on the differentiated growth profile of Epoxy.
We expect it won't be long before our Epoxy business delivers greater than $1 billion of EBITDA and carries the same enterprise value that all of Olin carries today, more representative of a highly engineered materials company.
Finally, I will close on Slide number 8.
No doubt that a majority of our forward discussion will center on leadership, our linchpin products, great supply demand fundamentals, parlaying and lifting Olin people, however, new ways to create shareholder returns are evolving for Olin and help us earn above $10 of earnings per share.
