Net income of $65 million and earnings per share of $0.59 compared to $63.4 million and earnings per share of $0.58 in the same quarter last year.
The seven-day average of new cases is down to 92 with about a 2% positivity rate after a second stay-at-home order on Oahu starting in late August.
On October 15, Hawaii's tourism sector reopened with a program allowing domestic travelers with a negative COVID test to bypass the 14-day quarantine.
Since then, we've seen an average of 5,600 arrivals per day, up from the roughly 2,000 a day that we saw before the 15th.
Year-to-date September, Oahu's single family home prices were up 3.3% and compared to the month of September last year, Oahu's single family home prices were up more than 13% driven by low inventory and low interest rates.
Lower fuel costs and a lower revenue balancing account component from higher-than-projected electricity sales last year meant that an Oahu residential customer using 500-kilowatt hours of electricity in October paid 13% less than in March.
In improving the settlement, the Commission maintained Hawaiian Electric's current allowed return on equity of 9.5% and 58% equity capitalization, lifted the 90% cap on Schofield Generating Station project cost recovery, ended the 2017 rate case customer benefit adjustments and deemed the enterprise resource planning system benefits commitment to be flowed through to customers as part of the zero base rate increase.
To help offset the lack of a base rate increase and deliver on our commitment to ramp up to $25 million in customer savings by year-end 2022, our utility is executing on its multi-year efficiency improvement program, which began earlier this year.
We are on track to exceed the 2020 RPS milestone of 30% for the year.
Since the RPS calculation divides renewable energy by sales, lower sales due to COVID temporarily pushed our RPS above 35% as of the second quarter.
With electricity sales expected to increase in the fourth quarter, we expect RPS to moderate, but still exceed 30% by year-end.
In the third quarter, we filed eight purchase power agreements for renewable energy and storage projects and to self-build storage applications as part of our Stage 2 procurement.
Last month the PUC approved the 8th final PPA from our Stage 1 procurement for a solar-plus-storage project on Maui.
If all Stage 1 projects and the filed Stage 2 projects come online in anticipated timeframes, they would add nearly 600 megawatts of renewable energy and 3 gigawatt hours of storage to our system between now and the end of 2023.
The Stage 2 projects together with our recently proposed Kahului synchronous condenser project will also help us retire one of our Maui fossil plants by 2024.
We are also preparing an RFP for up to 235 megawatts of community-based renewable energy.
If you add up what I've just talked about, you get over 800 megawatts, that's on a system with a total peak load of just 1,200 megawatts on Oahu and 200 megawatt each on Hawaii Island and Maui County.
We've generally summarized areas of consensus and divergence on Slide 30 of our deck.
The Commission has been progressing other dockets too, and just last week approved a 50-year contract for Hawaiian Electric to own, operate and maintain the electric system serving the Army's 12 installations on Oahu.
Consolidated earnings per share were $0.59 versus $0.58 in the same quarter last year.
Consolidated trailing 12 month ROE remains healthy at 9.4%.
Utility ROE increased 80 basis points versus the same time last year to 8.4%.
Bank ROE, which we look at on an annualized rather than a trailing 12-month basis was 6.8% for the quarter down from last year due to the economic impacts of COVID and a low interest rate environment.
Utility earnings were $60.1 million compared to $46.8 million in the same quarter last year.
The most significant variance drivers were $10 million lower O&M expenses, primarily due to fewer generating unit overhauls, lower labor cost due to lower staffing levels and reduced over time and elevated vegetation management work in the third quarter of 2019.
The lower overhauls represented about $5 million of the $10 million O&M variance.
Of the $5 million, $2 million was due to an elevated number of overhauls in the third quarter of 2019, and the remaining $3 million was timing as some overhaul work will be performed later this year or in 2021.
We also had a $5 million revenue increase from higher rate adjustment mechanism revenues and a $1 million increase in major project interim recovery revenues for the West Loch PV and Grid Modernization projects.
$1 million lower AFUDC as there were fewer long duration projects in construction work in progress.
$1 million higher savings from enterprise resource planning system implementation, which are to be returned to customers and $1 million higher depreciation due to increasing investments to integrate renewable energy and improve customer reliability and system efficiency.
COVID related costs have been $12.4 million to date, mostly related to bad debt expense.
Lower fuel prices have been good for our customers with a typical 500-kilowatt hour residential monthly bill on Oahu in October was down $21 since March, due to fuel price savings for customers.
On Slide 11, based on year-to-date information, we are forecasting $340 million to $350 million of capex in 2020, down from $360 million communicated last quarter, primarily due to unexpected delays from COVID-19 and completion of some of our work at lower cost.
We still expect capex to average approximately $400 million per year or about 2 times depreciation.
Turning to the bank on Slide 12.
American's net income was $12.2 million in the quarter compared to $14 million in the prior quarter.
As you may recall, we had a large one-time impact in the second quarter from $9.3 million in gains on sale of securities on a pre-tax basis.
We were able to replace much of that amount through a combination of record mortgage projection generating mortgage banking income of $7.7 million versus $6.3 million last quarter and resumption of previously suspended fees driving $9.6 million in fee revenue compared to $7.2 million last quarter.
In the second quarter, we incurred $3.7 million in COVID-19 related expenses consisting of additional -- paid to frontline employees, the payout of excess vacation days for employees unable to use vacation while working through the pandemic, purchases of PPE and sanitation supplies, the employee meals to promote employee safety and support Small Business restaurants.
In the third quarter, our COVID-19 related costs were down $3.1 million to $0.7 million consisting primarily of cleaning and sanitation costs.
On Slide 14, as expected ASB's net interest margin compressed more moderately in the third quarter than prior quarter, narrowing 9 basis points to 3.1%.
Record low cost of funds and lower FAS 91 amortization help to offset the impact of the low interest rate environment on asset yields.
For the full year, we expect to be within our previously guided NIM range of 3.35% to 3.25%, year-to-date net interest margin was 3.34%.
This quarter's provision was $14 million compared to $15.1 million in the linked quarter.
With uncertainty regarding if we will realize a sustained gradual reopening of tourism and strengthening of our economy, this quarter's provision included $12.3 million in additional reserves related to potential economic impacts from the pandemic.
Slide 16 provides an update on what we're seeing in our loan portfolio.
Overall, we have a high quality loan book that remains healthy with only 3% of our portfolio on active deferral at the end of the quarter.
76% of deferred loans have returned to payment.
Previously deferred loans, do have a somewhat higher delinquency rate of 1% compared to 0.3% for our portfolio as a whole.
The bank is over $3.2 billion in available liquidity from a combination of reliable sources.
ASB's Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.35% was comfortably well above well capitalized levels as of the end of the quarter.
As of September 30, we had $425 million of undrawn credit facility capacity, consisting of $150 million at the holding company and $275 million at the utility, with just $23 million in commercial paper outstanding, all of which was at the holding company.
At the holding company in September, we executed a $50 million private placement to pre-fund a March 21 maturity.
In October, we launched and priced a subsequent transaction to pre-fund a term loan maturity coming up in April, 21.
At the utility, in October we executed $115 million private placement, which we can draw on at any time leading up to its January funding date.
On Slide 20, we've updated our guidance for the full year.
At the utility, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $1.46 to $1.54 per share, and expect the utility to be within the bottom half of that range.
We're also working to offset the lack of the Hawaii Electric base rate increase and as mentioned, we're expecting capex to be $10 million to $20 million lower than previously anticipated.
We've revised our pre-tax pre-provision income guidance upward to $105 million to $115 million versus the previous range of $90 million to $110 million or $10 million increase from mid-point to mid-point.
Our holding company guidance is unchanged at $0.27 to $0.29 loss.
