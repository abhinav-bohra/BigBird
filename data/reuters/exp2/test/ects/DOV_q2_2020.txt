Let's begin with the summary of the results on Page 3.
Revenue declined 16% organically and bookings declined 21%.
After profitability gains in Q1 on lower revenue, we targeted 25% to 30% decremental margin for the full year.
We generated $78 million more in free cash flow than the comparable quarter last year.
As a result of our first half performance and our solid order backlog, we are reinstating our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.00 to $5.25 per share.
Let's take a look at the segment performance on Slide 4.
Increased margin performance was commendable with 80 basis point increase on a better mix pricing and ongoing productivity actions.
Let's go to Slide 5.
FX continued to be a meaningful headwind in Q2, reducing top line by 1% or $24 million.
The US, our largest market declined 10% organically, with four segments posting organic declines, partially offset by growth in retail fueling.
All of Asia declined 14%.
China representing approximately half of our business in Asia, showed early signs of stabilization posting an 11% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, an improvement compared to a 36% decline in Q1.
Europe was down 19% on organic declines in all five segments.
Bookings were down 21% organically on declines across all five segments, but there are reasons for cautious optimism as we enter the second half.
Second, our backlog is up 8% compared to this time last year, driven by our longer cycle businesses and the previously mentioned intra-quarter improvement in our shorter cycle businesses.
Let's move to the bridges on Slide 6.
In the quarter, we delivered on the $50 million annual cost reduction program, which focuses on IT footprint and back office efficiency, and took additional restructuring charges that add to the expected benefits.
We also executed well in the quarter on additional cost takeout to offset the under-absorbed -- under-absorption of fixed cost previously estimated at $35 million to $40 million.
The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately 21.5% for the quarter, unchanged from the first quarter.
Discrete tax benefits in the quarter were approximately $2 million, slightly lower than the prior year's second quarter.
Rightsizing and other costs were $17 million in the quarter or $13 million after-tax relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into 2020.
Now moving to Slide 7.
We are pleased with the cash generation in the first half of the year, with year-to-date free cash flow of $269 million, a $126 million or 90% increase over last year.
Q2 also benefited from an approximately $40 million deferral of US tax payments into the second half of the year.
Capital expenditures were $79 million for the first six months of the year, a $12 million decline versus the comparable period last year.
Lastly now on Slide 8.
We have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage of 2.2 times EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating with a safety -- with a margin of safety.
Second, we are operating with approximately $1.6 billion of current liquidity, which consists of $650 million of cash and $1 billion of unused revolver capacity.
When commercial paper markets were fractured at the outset of the pandemic in March, we drew $500 million on our revolver out of an abundance of caution.
In Q2, we also secured a new incremental $450 million revolver facility to further bolster our liquidity position.
We can -- we have deployed nearly a $250 million on accretive acquisitions so far this year and we continue to pursue attractive acquisitions.
I'm on Page 9, which is an updated view of the demand outlook by business we introduced last quarter.
In Europe and Asia, integrated oil companies represent a larger share of the network and capital budget cuts resulting from oil price declines are having a more negative impact on investment in the retail network, plus recall we are facing a $50 million revenue headwind in China this year from the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate, despite some of the top line headwinds with robust margin accretion to date, we expect segment to hold its comparable full-year profit line despite a decreasing top line.
Let's go to Slide 10.
The proactive cost management stance we took in Q1 and continued in Q2 has positioned us from a margin performance standpoint, and today we are improving our target for annual decrementals margin to 20% to 25%.
We remain confident in the cash flow capacity of this portfolio and reiterating a conversion target above 100% of adjusted net earnings and a cash flow margin target of 10% to 12% compared to 8% to 12% target we had last year.
