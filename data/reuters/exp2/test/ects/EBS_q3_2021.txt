As of the end of the quarter, we've contributed over 100 million dose equivalents of COVID-19 vaccine for global distribution.
First, we received the contract modification exercising and funding the second of nine annual options to supply ACAM2000 to the Strategic National Stockpile valued at approximately $182 million.
Secondly, we received a contract modification exercising and funding the procurement of additional doses of AV7909 for the SNS valued at approximately $399 million over the next 18 months.
And as I mentioned at the top of the call, we're extremely proud that our collaboration with J&J and in addition to AstraZeneca has contributed over 100 million dose equivalents of COVID-19 vaccine for global distribution.
Finally, I want to commend our team whose around the work efforts over the last 18 months that accelerated the transformation of our Bayview facility from a clinical stage facility to one that is poised to support much larger scale production.
Recall that we previously announced the US government exercised and funded, the next term extension for ACAM2000 under our 10-year contract and we also secured the next option exercise for our smallpox therapeutic, VIGIV.
We recently filed that up with the US government exercising the final option under the existing contract to supply doses of our next-generation anthrax vaccine candidate, AV7909 to the Strategic National Stockpile valued at approximately $399 million over the next 18 months.
The study expects to enroll 3,150 participants in 50 US sites in the coming months.
Building off an existing agreement this new baseline agreement is valued at $90 million and uses portions of all three of our integrated service capabilities, demonstrating the value of our integrated molecule-to-market model for customers.
I'll start on slide 10 and open my remarks with some summary thoughts to put today's earnings report into context.
Having said that, there are clearly several topics that merit further explanation, starting with the primary drivers of our revised 2021 financial guidance as laid out on slide 11.
This change will be partially offset by the recognition of $60 million in deferred revenue and other final payments related to the CIADM base agreement.
You'll also note that given continued strong momentum in NARCAN Nasal Spray, we increased the full year forecast range of that product by $95 million.
After taking into account various other puts and takes, we have tightened the range of our total revenues which lowered the midpoint by $50 million.
Accordingly, in the third quarter we adjusted our revenue to align with the $315 million of cumulative cash collected under the BARDA task order from May 2020 through September 2021.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, pursuant to the termination of the CIADM agreement, we expect to recognize $215 million of revenue, comprised of $155 million of task order closeout payments and the $60 million of deferred revenue and other I just discussed.
Termination of the CIADM agreement also results in asset write-downs of approximately $38 million.
So we expect the net addition to pre-tax income in the fourth quarter related to this event to be approximately $177 million.
During the quarter, our new business wins were $118 million, a very strong performance for the organization, primarily reflecting the impact of the Providence Therapeutics contract for COVID-related work.
As indicated on slide 12 highlights include total revenues of $329 million below the prior year period and our guidance principally due to the $86 million reversal of revenue for the BARDA task order I mentioned earlier.
And adjusted negative -- adjusted EBITDA of negative $3 million and adjusted net loss of $19 million both significantly below the prior year period and due to a variety of factors which we will discuss in a moment.
Other key items in the quarter include: NARCAN Nasal Spray sales were $133 million an increase over the prior year reflecting a clear continuation of this franchise's robust performance and driven by continued strong demand for this critical drug device combination product for opioid overdose reversal across both the retail and public interest channels in the United States as well as increased Canadian sales.
ACAM2000 sales were $81 million higher than the prior year due to timing of deliveries following our announcement in July of the US government's exercise of the second option under the existing 10-year procurement contract.
Anthrax vaccine sales were $16 million lower than the prior year due to timing of deliveries as the modifications of the BARDA contract for AV7909 was not made until the last day of the quarter.
Other product sales were $41 million consistent with the prior year.
And CDMO revenues came in at $42 million lower than the prior year period due primarily to our move to cash basis revenue accounting for the BARDA task order and partially offset by $38 million in out-of-period adjustments related to our change in CDMO services revenue recognition policy which will be detailed in our 10-Q filing.
Product cost of goods sold in the quarter were $103 million a $17 million decrease from the prior year largely due to one-time charges in the prior year offset by increases in the current year due to higher product sales.
CDMO cost of goods sold were $114 million an $86 million increase over the prior year reflecting the impact of out-of-period adjustments of $37 million as well as incremental costs at our Bayview facility as mentioned previously.
Gross R&D expense of $50 million lower than the prior year primarily reflecting a non-recurring $29 million impairment charge in the prior year.
Net R&D expense of $33 million or 10% of adjusted revenue in line with the prior year.
SG&A spend of $82 million or 25% of total revenues an increase over the prior year reflecting growth in headcount and professional services.
And gross margin was 30% in the quarter.
Adjusted product gross margin was 62% of product sales consistent with the prior period.
And adjusted CDMO services gross margin was 10% lower than the prior period primarily reflecting the impact of increased operating costs at our Bayview facility and the implementation of our quality enhancement plan.
Turning to slide 13 we will now review our key CDMO metrics.
In the third quarter we secured new business of $118 million reflecting robust demand for our services.
As of September 30 the rolling backlog was just over $1 billion a 9% decline from the second quarter reflecting the impact of the BARDA task order termination.
And lastly as of September 30 the opportunity funnel was $284 million down from $672 million at June 30 as I said before primarily reflecting a significant new business win in the current quarter as well as the loss of two large opportunities.
On slide 14 you can see the sequential trends in these metrics over the last five reporting periods.
Moving on to slide 15, I'll touch on select balance sheet and cash flow highlights.
We ended the third quarter in a strong liquidity position, with $404 million in cash and undrawn revolver capacity of just under $600 million.
Our net debt position was $454 million, and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA was one times.
Our year-to-date operating cash flow was negative $8 million, primarily reflecting timing of cash collections and increases in inventory balances.
Additionally, we reported cumulative year-to-date capital expenditures of $178 million.
Total revenue of $1.70 billion to $1.8 billion; NARCAN Nasal Spray sales of $400 million to $420 million; anthrax vaccine sales of $250 million to $260 million; ACAM2000 sales of $200 million to $220 million; and for the CDMO business we now anticipate a range of $600 million to $650 million.
Our profitability guidance includes adjusted EBITDA of $500 million to $550 million and adjusted net income of $315 million to $350 million.
And the expected range of adjusted gross margin is now 54% to 56% taking into account both year-to-date performance and anticipated performance in the fourth quarter.
