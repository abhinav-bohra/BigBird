Sales for the quarter decreased 63% primarily due to lower production levels as we had idled our One Earth and NuGen ethanol plants in March.
Ethanol sales for the quarter were based upon 26.5 million gallons this year versus 60.4 million last year.
Sales for the quarter were also impacted by 11% decline on ethanol pricing year-over-year.
We reported a gross profit of $553,000 in the second quarter for the ethanol and by-products segment versus a gross profit of $6.2 million in the prior year.
Our refined coal segment had a gross loss of $1.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $2.2 million for the prior year, based upon lower volume.
These losses are offset by tax benefit of $2.9 million and $3.2 million for the second quarters of fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively, recorded from the Section 45 credits and the tax benefits from operating losses.
SG&A was similar between quarters at $4.4 million this year versus $4.8 million in the prior year.
We had a loss of $507,000 from our unconsolidated equity investment in this year's second quarter versus income of $239,000 in the prior year, reflecting overall ethanol industry conditions.
Interest and other income declined year-over-year from $1.3 million to $197,000, primarily due to lower interest rates on our cash and short-term investments as interest rates fell sharply during the current year.
We recorded a tax benefit of $4.1 million for the second quarter of this year versus $2.6 million in the prior year.
We recorded our federal tax benefit from currently calculated tax losses at 35% rather than the current 21% tax rate based upon our ability to carry back losses five years due to the CARES Act.
These factors led to a net loss attributable to REX shareholders of $1.7 million in the current-year second quarter versus net income of $2.3 million in the prior year.
The only negative that we see -- or that I see is, at this current time, the biggest negative I see is, there is 98 refineries that have applied for RIN exemptions.

In terms of cash, we had over $180 million on a consolidated basis.
We bought back 30,536 shares during the last quarter.
We're authorized to buy another 241,185, which we will again, work on if the stock dips -- or dips to levels that we think are attractive for the company to be buying back the stock.
