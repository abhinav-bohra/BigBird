I'll begin on Slide 3 by recapping our investment thesis and our key financial metrics for 2021, which we are reaffirming today.
In the first quarter, we delivered 4% revenue growth underpinned by market share gains in ATMs and self-checkout solutions.
I'll provide additional color about key market trends in just a minute, but I'll simply say that our growth in Q1 gives us the confidence to reiterate our 2021 revenue outlook of $4 billion to $4.1 billion.
To date, the main contributor has been our DN Now work streams, which includes services modernization, G&A efficiencies from enhancing our digital and cloud-enabled capabilities and selling a higher mix of self-checkout devices and DN Series ATMs. The company is off to a good start in Q1, and we're tracking to our previously disclosed plan of $160 million of gross savings this year.
Our outlook for 2021 is a range of $140 million to $170 million or approximately 30% of our adjusted EBITDA.
Slide 4 summarizes how our competitive differentiation is playing out in the marketplace and in our first quarter results.
These trends drove retail revenue growth of 11% in the quarter, excluding the impact of divestitures and currency.
During the quarter, we secured a multi-year agreement with the French retail group, Les Mousquetaires, to transform the checkout experience at nearly 2,000 stores with next generation point-of-sale and self-checkout products, our AllConnect Data Engine and dynamic self-service software.
We're seeing growing evidence of market share gains due to the advanced features and functionality of our next generation DN Series ATMs. In the United States, we're seeing gains among larger financial institutions, including an initial order to deliver DN Series cash recycling ATMs and maintenance services at a top 10 U.S. financial institution, which previously bought hardware from others.
With this wining [Phonetic], we received DN Series orders from five of the top 10 U.S. banks and we see opportunities to add to our success.
In Latin America, we're seeing DN Series orders from customers in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Honduras, including a contract with Banco Nacional de Mexico, or Banamex, to deliver approximately 1,200 DN Series ATMs, Vynamic software licenses and maintenance services.
For legacy ATMs, we're seeing service cost reductions of approximately 20%.
We increased the number of machines connected to ACDE by 10% sequentially during the first quarter.
As we connect more devices to AllConnect Data Engine, we expect the operational efficiencies will add to our service margins and contribute to our target range of 32% to 33%.
Beyond our growing pipeline, our managed services success in the quarter included a five-year contract to be the sole source supplier for maintenance, monitoring and help desk services for more than 4,000 self-service terminals and in a top five bank in the United Kingdom.
And, thirdly, a three-year managed services contract extension covering more than 3,500 self-service terminals with HSBC, the largest bank in Hong Kong.
Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million was the highest first quarter in the company's history and while Jeff will discuss the details, I'm especially pleased that our operating profit growth of 25% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% significantly outpaced our top line growth of 4%.
Slide 5 contains the first quarter P&L metrics for the past two years, providing a useful perspective of our transformed business model.
Total first quarter revenue of $944 million reflects foreign currency benefits of $34 million versus the prior-year period, partially offset by $23 million headwind from divested businesses.
Adjusted for foreign currency and divestitures, revenue increased 2.4% led by product growth of 11%, software growth of 7%, and a services decline of 4%.
We generated $273 million of non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter, an increase of $19 million or 7% versus the prior year period, reflecting higher revenue and improving margins from our DN Now achievements.
Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 29%.
We've expanded gross margins across all three segments, led by strong gains in software and services of approximately 590 basis points and 220 basis points, respectively.
Product gross margins declined 200 basis points, due primarily to non-recurring benefits in the prior year period and a slightly less favorable customer mix.
Operating profit increased $16 million or 25% versus the prior quarter, while operating margins gained 150 basis points to 8.4%.
R&D expense was $3 million higher year-over-year, due to planned growth investment.
We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $100 million in the quarter, which increased $11 million or 12% over the prior year.
On Slide 6, Eurasia Banking revenue of $328 million, increased 5% versus the prior year period excluding the foreign currency benefit of $21 million and a $20 million impact from divestitures.
Segment gross profit increased $7 million year-over-year with contributions from all three business lines.
Foreign currency benefits of $8 million were partially offset by interim cost benefits from the prior year.
Gross margin expanded 60 basis points year-over-year led by software and services improvements, while product margins declined due to a less favorable customer mix.
Moving to Slide 7, Americas Banking revenue of $312 million declined 7% versus the prior year, excluding a $6 million foreign currency headwind and a $2 million divestiture headwind.
Segment gross profit of $97 million was down $7 million year-over-year due to lower volume and modest currency and divestiture headwinds.
Gross margin expansion of 100 basis points to 31.3% was driven by benefits from DN Now initiatives.
On Slide 8, retail revenue of $304 million increased 11% year-over-year after adjusting for $19 million foreign currency tailwind and the divestiture headwind of $1 million.
When compared to the prior year period, retail gross profit increased 32% and $79 million, due primarily to revenue growth.
Gross margin expanded 260 basis points, demonstrating that our team is doing a great job delivering positive operating leverage, revenue growth, a more favorable mix of self-checkout solutions and continued execution of DN Now initiatives.
On Slide 9, we summarize our free cash flow performance and update our leverage and debt maturity schedules.
Free cash flow use of $70 million in the quarter was up slightly compared with the prior year quarter and was in line with our internal plan.
On an unlevered basis, free cash flow use improved from $30 million to $10 million year-over-year due to higher profits and lower restructuring events.
For modeling purposes, investors should expect our cash interest payments to be approximately $30 million in the second and fourth quarters and approximately $60 million in the third quarter of 2021.
When compared with year-end, the company's cash balance reflects seasonal cash use for us approximately $30 million used to pay down a portion of the revolving credit facility.
The company ended the quarter with $573 million of total liquidity, including $260 million of cash and short-term investments.
At the end of the quarter, the company's leverage ratio of 4.4 times was unchanged versus year-end and down one-tenth of the term from the year ago period.
Slide 10 contains our 2021 outlook, which we are reaffirming today.
We expect to generate revenue of $4 billion to $4.1 billion, which equates to 3% to 5% annual growth.
Our adjusted EBITDA range is $480 million to $500 million for the year, or 6% to 10% growth as we benefit from topline growth and operating leverage.
Operating expense for the second quarter is expected to be in line with the first quarter or approximately $194 million, although it could be slightly higher if the euro continues its strength against the U.S. dollar.
We continue to expect $140 million to $170 million of positive cash flow for 2021, including up to $50 million for DN Now restructuring payments.
Our outlook reflects a material improvement in the company's EBITDA, to free cash flow conversion rate from 12% in 2020 to approximately 30% in 2021.
