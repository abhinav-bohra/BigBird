We commenced business operations more than 20 years ago, intent on protecting and serving our consumers in their most critical time in some of the most challenging coastal areas in the United States for natural disasters.
We entered this critical time in a position of strength with a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 2%.
We are off to a good start in 2020 with solid first quarter results, including an annualized return on average equity of 16.1% and progress on our reinsurance renewals for June 1.
In addition, we have accelerated the use of our virtual inspection software and trained an additional 100 employees on the application.
earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61 on a GAAP basis and $0.79 on a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share basis.
Direct premiums written were up 15.7% for the quarter, led by strong direct premium growth of 19% in other states and 15% in Florida.
Net premiums earned were up 5.3% for the quarter, reflecting an increase in direct premiums earned offset by increased costs for reinsurance.
On the expense side, the combined ratio increased seven points for the quarter to 94.1%, driven primarily by increased losses in connection with the continued diversification in the company's underlying business to states outside of Florida, an increase in core loss pick for 2020, an increase in prior year adverse development, partially offset by a lower level of weather events in 2020 and a small reduction in the expense ratio.
Total services revenue increased 25.6% to $15.3 million for the quarter, driven primarily by commission revenue earned on ceded premiums.
On our investment portfolio, net investment income decreased 16.1% to $6.8 million for the quarter, primarily due to significantly lower yields on cash and short-term investments during the first quarter of 2020 when compared to the first quarter of 2019.
That said, we still ended the quarter with an overall unrealized gain in our fixed income portfolio of $15.4 million, which has further improved subsequent to the end of the first quarter.
To be clear, the impact COVID-19 had during the first quarter on debt and equity markets affected our book value per share by approximately $0.45, made up of approximately $0.27 related to the balance sheet-only impact from the decline in the amount of unrealized gains in our fixed income portfolio with the remainder being attributable to the effect of unrealized losses on our equity securities reflected in the P&L and consequently in retained earnings.
The credit rating on our fixed income securities was A plus at the end of the first quarter with a duration of 3.6 years, which we feel gives us a strong foundation to weather the current market conditions.
In regards to capital deployment, during the first quarter, the company repurchased approximately 312,000 of UVE shares at an aggregate cost of $6.6 million.
On April 16, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share payable on May 21, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 14, 2020.
As of 3/31, Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, each were approaching single-digit open claims and are very near the end.
Hurricane Michael had approximately 200 open claims and continues to be booked at the same $360 million as year-end.
On Hurricane Irma, despite the fact that new claims continued to be reported throughout the first quarter, we still successfully reduced the remaining open claim countdown to below 600.
As we prepare for the 3-year statute of limitation for filing new Irma claims, we elected to add another $50 million of IBNR to this event.
This brings our booked ultimate to $1.45 billion at 3.31%.
As noted in our release, we have added an additional $1 million to accident year 2020 losses as we monitor these events.
As we disclosed during our year-end earnings call, with capacity already locked in via the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund and multiyear deals, we stood at over 75% of our desired core first event reinsurance tower complete.
As of today, the percentage complete is approaching 90%, so we are well on our way.
