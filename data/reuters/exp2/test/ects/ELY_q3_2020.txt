Having said this, and turning to Page 6, let's now jump into our results.
According to Golf Datatech, U.S. retail sales of golf equipment were up 42% during Q3, the highest Q3 on record.
U.S. rounds were up 25% in September, and are now showing full-year growth despite the shutdowns earlier this year.
In the U.S., third-party research showed our brand to once again be the #1 club brand in overall brand rating as well as the leader in innovation and technology.
Turning to our soft goods and apparel segment, with total revenue only down 3.4% year over year, the segment also experienced a rapid recovery in demand during the quarter.
Jack Wolfskin was down year over year but only 16% on a revenue basis with improved trends continuing into October.
As a result of these investments, we were able to deliver a 108% year-over-year growth in this channel during the quarter.
And although the pandemic delayed our efforts, we still believe we'll be able to deliver $15 million of synergies in this segment over the coming years.
During the quarter, we also made good progress on key initiatives, including the transition to our new 800,000 square-foot Superhub distribution center located just outside of Fort Worth, Texas.
Our available liquidity, which includes cash on hand plus availability under our credit facilities increased to $630 million on September 30, 2020, compared to $340 million on September 30, 2019.
Fourth, the $174 million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020 is nonrecurring and did not affect 2019 results.
