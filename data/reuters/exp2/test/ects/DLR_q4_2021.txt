We further strengthened connections with customers with $156 million of new bookings with record results in both a zero to 1 megawatt and greater than a megawatt category and ended the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase over the prior year.
And finally, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the establishment of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers.
First, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-1 megawatt and greater than 1 megawatt categories.
and Canada, valued at $1.4 billion at a 4.25% cap rate.
We generated net proceeds of over $950 million from the transaction, and we retained a 35% equity interest in the publicly traded REIT.
The offering was very well received, and Digital Core REIT has traded up approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the gain on our remaining ownership stake.
As mentioned, Digital Realty will continue to own a 10% direct ownership stake in each of the assets in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle.
Our second global initiative, which we announced just after quarter end, is the definitive agreement to acquire roughly a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa's leading carrier-neutral colocation provider.
Teraco has seven state-of-the-art data centers across three key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises.
Teraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and hosts seven cloud on-ramps and provides direct access to seven subsea cables.
The current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%.
Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3.
1 ranked data center company.
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4.
We spent $580 million on growth capex in the fourth quarter, our largest quarterly growth capex investment to date.
We currently have 44 projects underway, totaling more than 250 megawatts of IT capacity in 27 metros around the world.
This capacity was 46% presold as of year-end.
Geographically, we continue to invest most heavily in EMEA with 27 projects underway, totaling more than 140 megawatts across 16 metros.
In January, we opened Digital Seoul 1, our first data center in South Korea and the first carrier-neutral facility in the country.
This facility will serve as a connectivity gateway for latency-sensitive customer workloads, but can be connected to hyperscale applications hosted in our second facility in Korea, totaling over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside the city center.
Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5.
Industry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies.
Additionally, Gartner believes that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies.
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7.
As Bill noted, we delivered record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60-40 split between greater than 1 megawatt and less than 1 megawatt plus interconnection.
The EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings led by Frankfurt with standout performance across product types.
Nearly 30% of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform.
Both EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region.
The weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA.
We landed over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter's record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos.
A Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros.
A Global 2000 insurance brokerage is consolidating their data center footprint and has adopted PlatformDIGITAL to remove data gravity barriers and interconnect with clouds across multiple metros.
Turning to our backlog on Page 9.
The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $330 million to $378 million as our fourth -- record fourth quarter signings more than offset commencements.
The lag between signings and commencements was unusually high at nearly 14 months, primarily driven by long-term leases on recent development starts in EMEA as customers accelerated efforts to secure a long-term runway for growth against a backdrop of steadily dwindling inventory.
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10.
We signed $151 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter in addition to the record new leases signed.
Renewal rates rolled down 4%, driven by a handful of large deals in North America as negative releasing spreads on greater than 1 megawatt renewals more than offset the positive releasing spreads on the sub-1 megawatt renewals.
In terms of operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy ticked down 60 basis points, almost entirely due to development deliveries placed in service during the quarter.
Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by churn in North America, as well as higher property operating and net utilities expense.
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11.
The U.S. dollar strengthened during the fourth quarter relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 130 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line.
Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move in base rates would have roughly a 50 basis point impact on our full year FFO per share.
In terms of earnings growth, fourth quarter core FFO per share was up 4% year over year and up 1% sequentially, driven by solid operational execution, cost controls and a reduction in financing costs due to proactive balance sheet management over the past 12 months.
For the full year, core FFO per share was up 5% year over year and came in $0.03 above the high end of our initial guidance range, which did not contemplate the contribution of $1.4 billion of assets through Digital Core REIT in early December.
As a reminder, full year core FFO per share excludes the $20 million promote fee on the Prudential joint venture in the third quarter, as well as the $25 million PPA settlement in the first quarter.
Looking ahead to 2022, we expect core FFO per share will be between $6.80 and $6.90, including the 1% dilution from Teraco, as well as 100 to 200 basis points of expected FX headwinds due to the strength of the dollar relative to 2021.
We expect to deliver revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion in 2022 and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion.
We are off to a great start on our financing plans for the year with a highly successful 750 million bond offering in early January of 10.5-year paper at 1.375% coupon.
Finally, we expect to raise $500 million to $1 billion from capital recycling whether through contributions to Digital Core REIT, noncore asset sales to third parties or a combination of both.
Given the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend, just as we have had each and every year since our IPO in 2004.
Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12.
As of year-end, our reported leverage ratio stood at 6.1 times, while fixed charge coverage was 5.4 times.
Pro forma for settlement of the $1 billion September forward equity offering, leverage drops to 5.7 times, while fixed charge coverage also improved to 5.7 times.
As Bill previously mentioned, we recast our credit facility during the fourth quarter, upsizing from $2.35 billion to $3 billion, extending the maturity by three years and tightening pricing by 5 basis points.
Subsequent to quarter end, we raised approximately $850 million from the 10.5-year euro bonds at 1.375%, and we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem all $450 million of our outstanding 4.75% U.S. dollar bonds due 2025.
As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is just over 2%.
A little over three-quarters of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. 94% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment, and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.
Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years.
