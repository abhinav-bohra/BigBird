Now for context on the magnitude of the inflation, in our materials businesses alone, we will be exiting this year with annualized inflation of more than $600 million.
That's a nearly 20% increase; a rate we have not seen in decades.
The segment grew 22% on a constant currency basis and 14% organically, driven by strength in both high-value product categories, as well as the core Apparel business.
Intelligent Labels sales, enterprisewide, were up 15% in the quarter and we are on track for approximately 30% organic growth for the year versus 2020 and 40% versus 2019, toward the higher end of our long-term target.
In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, sales continue to rebound off prior year lows and were up relative to 2019 by 11% on a constant currency basis.
We now anticipate an earnings growth of roughly 25% over last year's record and are on track to achieve all of our five-year companywide goals that we established in early 2017.
We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up 12% over prior year, and up 29% compared to 2019, driven by significant revenue growth and strong margins.
Sales were up 17% ex-currency and 14% on an organic basis compared to prior year, driven by strong volume across the portfolio and higher prices.

Year-to-date, we've generated $639 million of free cash flow, up over [Phonetic] $251 million in the third quarter.

To fund the acquisition, we used the net proceeds from an $800 million senior note offering in August, along with cash in commercial paper.
Additionally, in the first three quarters of the year, we returned a total of $290 million in cash to shareholders, through $164 million in dividends and the repurchase of over 700,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $126 million.
Our balance sheet continues to be strong with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 at quarter end, at the bottom end of our long-term target leverage range.
Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 15% ex-currency and 14% on an organic basis, driven by strong volume and roughly 5 points from higher prices.

This pricing impact led to a reduction in operating margin by roughly 0.75% [Phonetic] in the third quarter.
RBIS sales were up 22% ex-currency and 14% on an organic basis as growth remained strong in both the high-value categories and the base business due, in part, to lower prior year comps.
Compared to 2019, organic growth was up 9%.
As Mitch mentioned, Intelligent Labels sales were up organically, roughly 15% and up about 40% compared to 2019.
Adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 13.8% as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset the headwinds from prior year temporary cost reduction actions, higher employee-related costs, and growth investments.
Sales increased 20% ex-currency and 15% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth in both the Industrial and Healthcare categories.
Compared to 2019, sales were up 6% on an organic basis.
Adjusted operating margin decreased to roughly 10% as the benefit from higher volume was more than offset by the net impact of pricing, higher freight and raw material costs and higher employee-related cost.

In particular, the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the resulting calendar shift will be a headwind to reported sales growth of roughly 8 points in the fourth quarter of this year, with a roughly $0.30 earnings per share headwind.
The anticipated tailwind from currency translation is now $30 million in operating income for the full year, based on current rates.
And we expect a modest earnings per share benefit from Vestcom in 2021, net of purchase accounting amortization, which we estimate to be nearly $60 million on an annualized basis and net of financing costs.
[Technical Issues] target over $700 million of free cash flow this year, up significantly from previous years.
