Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC.
We've had the opportunity to prove this under both strong and weak demand conditions over the last 12 months.
Clearly, our global components business capitalized on strong demand in all regions this quarter with sales up 42% year-over-year.
As a result, global components sales reached $6.4 billion, which is an all-time record in the company's history.
Operating income from global components increased by more than 70% year-over-year.
First quarter sales increased 27% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis.
The average euro-dollar exchange rate for the quarter was $1.20 to EUR one compared to the rate of $1.23 we had used for forecasting.
For the full year 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be at the low end of our long-term range of 23% to 25%.
First quarter cash burn was approximately $5 million due to substantially stronger demand than we anticipated.
Our cash cycle of approximately 46 days improved 10 days compared to last year.
During the first quarter, we paid off the remaining $131 million of maturing five 1/8% notes.
During the quarter, we expanded our U.S. asset securitization program by $50 million to $1.25 billion and extended it to 2024.
We returned approximately $150 million to shareholders during the first quarter through our share repurchase plan.
The remaining authorization under our existing plan is approximately $313 million.
