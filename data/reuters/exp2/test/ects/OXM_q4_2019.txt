Our direct businesses which are 70% of our sales were strong with positive comps in all quarters of the year by brand and on a consolidated basis.
Importantly, our e-commerce business led the charge with 10% year-over-year growth and 11% comp and now represents 23% of sales.
At the same time, our wholesale sales declined in 2019 as many of those retailers continued to face strategic challenges with sales to department stores representing only 11% of our consolidated revenue.
Our adjusted earnings of $4.32 per share, which were flat with fiscal 2018 included the negative impact of increased tariffs as well as an increase and our effective tax rate, importantly as we ended the fiscal year with very strong liquidity, including $53 million of cash and no borrowings under our $325 million asset-based credit facility which leads us to the topic of the day.
In our 78-year history, Oxford has weathered many crises and we are highly confident in our ability to weather the impact that COVID-19 outbreak is having on our business and the retail marketplace.
As I mentioned earlier, we entered 2020 with over $50 million in cash and an undrawn $325 million credit facility.
To further bolster our cash concession and maintain our high level of liquidity, we have drawn down $200 million from the facility.
One of the largest is employment costs which were approximately $260 million in fiscal 2019.
We are also focusing efforts, including partnering with our landlords as appropriate on mitigating our occupancy costs which were over $100 million last year.
Marketing expense, which was over $50 million last year is being addressed in phases.
Also other variable costs such as credit card transaction fees, royalties on licensed brands, sales commissions, packaging in the supplies were approximately $50 million in fiscal 2019.
All capital expenditures are being reevaluated with many, including new store openings and remodels, as well as certain IT projects being deferred in this uncertain environment and our Board of Directors reduced our quarterly dividend from $0.37 a share to $0.25 per share.
