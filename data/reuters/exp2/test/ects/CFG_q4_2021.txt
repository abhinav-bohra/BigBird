For the quarter, our underlying earnings per share was $1.26, and our return on tangible common equity was 14.6%.
Sequential operating leverage was 1.5%.
And sequential growth in PPNR was a strong 6%.
1 in the league table for middle-market-sponsored transactions and No.
4 for overall middle market.
Our highlights for the quarter include strong sequential loan growth of 4% on a spot basis, 5% ex-PPP, while average growth was 2%.
And that's 3% ex-PPP.
Our capital position remained strong with CET1 ratio of 9.9%, giving us a great deal of capital management flexibility in 2022.
With respect to our guidance for 2022, we assume solid economic growth of around 4%, several Fed rate hikes, and improvement in loan demand.
Our TOP 6 and TOP 7 programs should allow us to keep expense growth ex-acquisitions below 3%.
And we're targeting 2% positive operating leverage, including the bank yield scheduled to close soon, and almost 5% ex-PPP impact.
And I'd expect our return on tangible common equity to move over 14% in the second half of the year, potentially reaching 15% in Q4.
We reported underlying net income of $569 million and earnings per share of $1.26.
Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.6%, which included the impact of a credit provision benefit.
Revenue of 1.7 billion was up 4% linked quarter, given strong growth in fee income.
Average loans are up a solid 3% in the quarter before the impact of PPP forgiveness, led by retail, which is up by 4% and 3% growth in commercial.
Overall spot loan growth of 5% for the quarter, excluding PPP, provides good underlying momentum for loan growth this year.
Linked quarter fee growth was 15% or 10% before acquisitions, including outstanding results in capital markets, driven by record M&A fees and loan syndications, as we've executed well and gained market share.
And excluding the impact of the two commercial fee-based acquisitions we closed in the second half, we delivered underlying positive sequential operating leverage of approximately 2% this quarter with well-controlled expenses.
We recorded a credit provision benefit of 25 million, which reflects strong credit performance and the improving economy.
Our year-end ACL ratio stands at 1.51%, above our day one CECL level of 1.47%.
We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.9% after returning $350 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.
Net interest income on Slide 6 is down 2% given lower net interest margin, partially offset by strong loan growth.
The net interest margin was 2.66%, down 6 basis points, reflecting a reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness and lower-earning asset yields, given changes in loan mix and spread compression, partially offset by the impact of lower cash balances as we redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth.
We also made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which are down 1 basis point to 13 basis points.
On the bottom left side of the page, you can see we remained highly asset-sensitive at the end of the quarter, with an overall sensitivity of 10.1% to a gradual 200 basis-point rise in rates.
At the end of the year, about 60% of our sensitivity is geared toward the short end, so we are well-positioned to benefit when the Fed begins to tighten.
Referring to Slide 7, we delivered terrific fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses with outstanding results in capital markets, reflecting our long-term investments in the business and solid performance across other fee categories.
We also delivered our best quarterly results of the year in FX and IRP, which are up 21% linked quarter, given an increase in currency transactions driven by robust M&A activity and an increase in client hedging given the outlook for rate rises.
Mortgage servicing income improved as our third-party servicing book grew 3% linked quarter to 90 billion.
On Slide 8, expenses were well-controlled.
And we drove the linked quarter operating leverage of about 2%.
Period-end loans on Slide 9 were up 4% linked quarter or 5% excluding PPP.
We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth, up more than 6% excluding PPP.
Retail loans are also growing, up 4%.
Average loans were up 2% and up more than 3% excluding PPP.
After line utilization levels ticked up last quarter, we saw a larger increase of about 270 basis points to 35% on a spot basis this quarter, primarily driven by deal-related financing activity.
In addition, our period-end commitments are up a very strong 8%, which will benefit us as investment continues to pick up.
On Slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories.
Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 5% year over year with strong growth in demand deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits, up from 30% last year.
We continue to make good progress on deposit repricing with interest-bearing deposit costs down 1 basis point to 13 basis points during the quarter.
Secondly, our mix of lower-cost deposits is much better with demand deposits now 32% of the book, compared to 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle.
And consumer CDs, which were at 14% of total deposits at the end of the last cycle, are now down to 3%, which is below peer levels.
Also, note that the HSBC branch acquisition will add almost 8 billion or 5% to our core deposits when we close this quarter.
Moving on to credit on Slide 11, we saw excellent credit results again this quarter.
Net charge-offs were broadly stable at 14 basis points for the fourth quarter with good performance across the portfolio.
Nonperforming loans decreased 6% linked quarter with continued improvement in commercial.
Moving to Slide 12, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength.
Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.9% at the end of the fourth quarter after returning $360 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and closing the JMP acquisition.
On the bottom right of the page, we expect a 22-basis-point impact at CET1 from the pending HSBC acquisition.
On Slide 13, you can see, we've dramatically transformed the consumer bank since the IPO and have a strong foundation to propel us into the future.
We're acquiring customers at a pace that far exceeds the pace of household formation in the U.S., nearly doubling our customer base from approximately 3 million at the time of our IPO to 6.4 million today.
Further, our mobile engagement is up 15% year over year, closing gaps to peers and allowing to thin our physical network by another 8% this year, about 20% since our IPO.
We've transformed our deposit book, repositioning our deposit mix quite significantly with strong DDA growth, which has really driven down our cost of funds by about 75% compared with the time of our IPO.
Moving on to Slide 14 and looking forward, we've prioritized several strategic initiatives that should help us deliver above-trend revenue growth, adding about 1 billion by the year five.
We will pick up almost 1 million new customers who have been underserved, given that their current banks don't have the breadth of product capabilities that we have.
We've built a very strong position, now with 44 partners.
And let me shift to our commercial priorities, which are on Slide 15.
On Slide 16, you'll see some examples of the tremendous progress we've made against the key strategic initiatives that Brendan and Don mentioned and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work.
Moving to Slide 17, I'll touch on our top programs.
We've effectively wrapped up our TOP 6 program after achieving our targeted pre-tax run-rate benefits of approximately $425 million at the end of 2021.
Now, we have launched TOP 7 with the goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2022.
Moving to Slide 18, we've made a lot of progress on the ESG front last year, and we will continue to make meaningful progress in 2022.
We adopted targets to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.
And now, for some high-level commentary on the outlook for full year 2022 on Slide 19.
For 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 5%, driven primarily by mid-single-digit average loan growth.
The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of January 5th and includes three implied Fed rate hikes of 25 basis points each in April, July, and December.
On the long end, we are planning for the 10-year treasury to be about 1.9% by the end of the year.
Fee income is expected to be up 4% to 7%, given continued strength in capital markets and wealth following record performances in 2021.
Noninterest expense is expected to be up 5% to 6%, given the full-year effect of our commercial fee-based acquisitions, or up less than 3% excluding the impact of these acquisitions.
We have included an expense walk on Slide 24 that lays out the drivers.
And we plan to continue operating with a CET1 ratio within our target range of 9.75% to 10%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividend in the second half of the year.
On the lower left of the slide, you'll see our expectations for the pro forma impact of HSBC and Investors with ETF accretion of about 5% based on consensus at the time of announcement and approximately 475 million in additional PPNR to our 2022 results.
Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis for the year, including HSBC and Investors.
And if you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be a very strong 5% uprate.
Moving to Slide 20, I'll cover the outlook for the first quarter.
We expect NII to be down about 1% despite solid loan growth, given a 20 million smaller contribution from PPP and an $18 million impact from lower day count.
Average loans are expected to be up 2% to 3% with interest-earning assets broadly stable.
Fees are expected to be down 8% to 12%, reflecting seasonally lower capital market fees than the record we delivered last quarter, as well as other seasonal impacts.
Noninterest expense is expected to be up approximately 6% given seasonal compensation impacts and the full-quarter impact of the JMP acquisition.
And we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%, including an impact of about 22 basis points from the HSBC transaction, which we expect to close mid-quarter.
To sum up with Slide 21, we feel that we finished 2021 with a great quarter and enter 2022 with strong momentum.
