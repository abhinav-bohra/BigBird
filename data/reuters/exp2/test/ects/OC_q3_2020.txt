Year-to-date 57% of our global facilities remain injury free.
In the third quarter, while we continue to perform at a high level with a recordable incident rate of 0.73, this result was above our third quarter 2019 performance and reminds us of the daily focus we must have on safety in order to achieve an injury free workplace.
Revenues were $1.9 billion, up 1% compared with the same period last year and adjusted EBIT was $289 million, up 4%.
In composites, volumes also continue to improve throughout the quarter with revenues down just 2%.
And in insulation, revenues also finished down 2% with EBIT margins of 11% driven primarily by the additional growth we saw in our North American residential fiberglass business.
As I stated earlier, we continue to see the U.S. housing market strengthening with demand around 1.4 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis for the last three consecutive months.
In the third quarter, given our cash flow, we were able to execute on all these areas, finishing the quarter with more than $1.7 billion of liquidity.
While only on day number 50, I'm already impressed with the resilience of the company and the dedication of our people.

For the Insulation business overall, our sequential operating leverage from Q2 to Q3 was 48%, in line with the outlook provided on the Q2 call.
Sales in composites for the third quarter were $521 million, down 2% as compared to the prior year due to lower selling prices and unfavorable product mix.

Sequentially, from Q2 to Q3, we generated operating leverage of 40%.
Slide 10 provides an overview of our Roofing business.
Roofing sales for the quarter were $761 million, up 7% compared with Q3 of 2019, driven by 12% volume growth, which was partially offset by lower year-over-year selling prices and lower third-party asphalt sales.
EBIT for the quarter was $196 million, up $53 million from the prior year, producing 26% EBIT margins for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 11, I'll discuss significant financial highlights for the third quarter of 2020.
As a result of disciplined actions taken and the recovery of U.S. residential markets, our third quarter free cash flow reached a record quarterly level and our year-to-date free cash flow of $514 million was $232 million higher than the same period last year.
Based on our strong cash flow performance and deleveraging activities, we're operating within our target debt to adjusted EBITDA range of 2 to 3 times with ample liquidity.
During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $190 million that was drawn on our revolver at the end of the first quarter.
We also repaid the remaining $150 million balance of the term loan in advance of the February 2021 due date.
We maintained our dividend in the third quarter and have returned $159 million to shareholders so far this year through dividends and share repurchases.
As of September 30th, the company had liquidity of more than $1.7 billion, consisting of $647 million of cash and cash equivalents and nearly $1.1 billion of combined availability on our revolver and receivable securitization facilities.
We continue to focus on maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and are evaluating additional U.S. pension contributions in the range of $50 million to $100 million to further delever the balance sheet and improve our credit metrics.
As we move into 2021, we recently announced an 8% price increase for our U.S. residential Insulation business effective January 11th.
In Roofing, third quarter industry shingle shipments were up about 25% with our volumes tracking below the market due to supply constraints driven by low inventories entering the quarter.
Similar to the last several years, we expect to see our overall fourth quarter revenue and EBIT performance similar to what we saw in the first quarter with an additional $5 million headwind related to rebuild costs.
We expect corporate expenses for the company to be approximately $125 million, primarily due to additional incentive compensation tied to our earnings outlook.
And we expect capital investments to be at the high end of the range we previously provided of $250 million to $300 million.
In terms of our capital allocation, we remain committed to generating strong free cash flow into our target of returning at least 50% to investors over time.
So far this year we have returned $159 million through share repurchases and dividends and we'll pay our third quarter dividend of approximately $26 million next week.
In our last call, we said we would focus on deleveraging the balance sheet and maintaining our dividend, we increased liquidity to over $1.7 billion, paid down the revolver and term loan and paid our dividend in the quarter.
