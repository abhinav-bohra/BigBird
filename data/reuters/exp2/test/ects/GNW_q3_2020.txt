These plans include raising $750 million of debt at U.S. MI holding company level which we completed in the third quarter.
Certain of those proceeds will be used to address our $338 million of debt maturing in February of 2021 which Dan will discuss as part of our overall liquidity position in his remarks.
Year to date, we have received approvals on $595 million of annualized in-force premiums representing a weighted average premium increase of 29% or $173 million of annual incremental premiums going forward.

We reported net income available to Genworth shareholders for the quarter of $418 million and adjusted operating income of $132 million.
The primary driver of the difference between adjusted operating income and net income was $250 million of net gain from the sale of U.S. Treasury scripts and our life insurance business, as we continue to reposition the portfolio at a time when the market value of those securities had appreciated significantly.
For the quarter, U.S. MI had adjusted operating income of $141 million and reported a loss ratio of 18%.
While new primary delinquencies during the third quarter were still elevated versus pre-COVID levels, they were down 66% sequentially, with approximately 75% of new primary delinquencies being reported in forbearance plans which may cure in an elevated rate.

Our servicer reported forbearance trends which are a leading indicator of delinquencies, have declined from peak levels in May and ended the third quarter with 6.7% and or 61,200 of our active primary policies reported in a forbearance plan, with 63% of those in forbearance being reported as delinquent.

We also continue to experience negative impact on DAC amortization and reserves from our 20-year term and 10-year term universal life insurance blocks, as they enter their post level premium period.

The term life insurance business was negatively impacted by shock lapses that continue to be higher than our original locked-in assumptions, as more of the large 20-year level premium term life insurance business written in the year 2,000 entered the post-level premium period during the quarter.
Total term life insurance stack amortization, a noncash impact primarily related to these term-life lapses, reduced earnings by $34 million after tax which is unfavorable compared to the prior quarter.
As sales levels declined in the second half of 2000, we expect amortization related to term policies entering the post-level period to begin to decrease in the fourth quarter and into 2021.
In the runoff segment, our adjusted operating income was $19 million for the third quarter.
Given the declining rates during this period, we currently believe that we will likely need to increase statutory reserves by approximately $200 million in 2020 which would equate to roughly a 15- to 20-point reduction in risk-based capital our Genworth life insurance company or GLIC.

In October, as part of our normal credit risk transfer program, we completed an insurance-linked note transaction which will provide an additional $350 million of PMIER's credit and would result in a PMIER sufficiency ratio of 147% against published requirements.
The PMIER's sufficiency calculation continues to include the effect of the 30% multiplier for eligible delinquencies associated with COVID-19.
