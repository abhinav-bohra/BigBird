Earnings for the quarter was $0.79 per share compared to $1.59 in the prior year quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.03 in the quarter compared to $1.96 in 2020.
Net sales in the quarter were up 17% from the prior year, primarily due to the pass through of higher material costs and increased beverage can and transit packaging volumes.
Segment income improved to $379 million in the quarter compared to $367 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales unit volumes.
As outlined in the release, we currently estimate fourth quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of between $1.50 and $1.55 per share, and full-year adjusted earnings of $7.50 to $7.55 per share.
Our expected adjusted tax rate for the year is between 23% and 24% consistent with our nine months rate.
Reported revenues increased 17% during the quarter as higher beverage and transit volumes coupled with the pass through of raw material cost increases offset supply chain challenges.
And in July, we discussed with you the step change in earnings that we have experienced beginning with last year's third quarter in which EBITDA over the last five quarters averages approximately $100 million more than the previous six quarters.
Also during the quarter, the Company joined the Climate Pledge, where we have committed to be net zero carbon by the year 2040.
Before reviewing the operating segments, we remind you that delivered aluminum here in North America is approximately 75%, 80% higher today than at this time last year.
In Americas beverage, overall unit volumes advanced 4% in the quarter as continued strong demand in North America and Mexico offset a difficult third quarter comparison in Brazil.
Our third quarter 2021 volumes in Brazil were more than 10% higher than the third quarter of 2019.
However, third quarter 2020 volumes were up 30% over the third quarter of '19, as that country rebounded sharply from the second quarter 2020 pandemic lockdowns.
Unit volumes in European beverage advanced 5% over the prior year with strong volumes across most operations in this segment.
In Asia Pacific, unit volumes declined 8% in the quarter owing entirely to a 55% contraction in Vietnam.
Excluding Vietnam, unit volumes grew 20% in the quarter.
So in summary, a very strong first nine months of 2021 with EBITDA up 26%.
As described earlier, we have several capacity projects recently completed and are underway and are pleased to reconfirm the 2025 EBITDA estimate of $2.5 billion first provided during the May virtual Investor Day.
And near-term, while we may experience inflation and supply chain related headwinds over the next few quarters, we currently expect 2022 will be another strong year of earnings growth with EBITDA estimated to be approximately $2 billion.
