We Specifically, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $115 million and pro forma earnings per share of $0.35 per share during the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the prior year quarter by 71%, fueled by solid contributions across our timber segments as well as an outsized contribution from our Real Estate segment due to the closing of two significant development transactions.
Based on our performance over the first nine months of the year and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're modestly raising our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $320 million to $330 million.
Our Southern Timber segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $24 million for the quarter, which was 7% below the prior year quarter.
We were encouraged to see net stumpage prices increase by 16%, but this lift in pricing was more than offset by 20% reduction in harvest volumes due to wet weather conditions and trucking shortages.
In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $13 million, an improvement of 38% from the prior year quarter.
This increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by a 15% increase in sawmill (sic) sawtimber prices as domestic lumber markets remained favorable.
In our New Zealand Timber segment, third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year to $20 million.
Favorable pricing more than offset, a significant increase in export shipping costs as well as 14% lower production volumes due to the government-mandated shutdown, which prohibited harvest activity throughout the country during a two-week period in August.
In our Real Estate segment, we generated record adjusted EBITDA of $64 million, up from $22 million in the prior year period, as we closed on a $38 million Unimproved Development sale in Kingston, Washington, and a $25 million improved development transaction in our Belfast Commerce Park project south of Savannah, Georgia.
During the third quarter, as previously announced, we sold the rights to manage Timber Funds, III and IV, as well as our co-investment stake in both funds for an aggregate purchase price of roughly $36 million.
We subsequently entered into three separate agreements to sell the remaining Fund II Timberland assets for an aggregate purchase price of $157 million.
All said, based on Rayonier's 20% ownership interest in Fund II, and factoring in the repayment of Fund II debt, proceeds to Rayonier from the sale of Fund II assets, will be roughly $24 million.
In addition, we expect to receive a carried interest incentive fee with respect to Fund II of approximately $14 million.
Overall, we view this as a favorable result for the sale process, particularly given the negative impact that last year's forest fires had on roughly 10,000 acres of Fund II and Fund IV properties, in Oregon.
Sales for the quarter totaled $365 million, while operating income was $123 million, and net income attributable to Rayonier was $76 million or $0.53 per share.
On a pro forma basis, net income was $50 million or $0.35 per share.
As Dave touched on, third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million was considerably above the prior year period, as an exceptionally strong contribution from our Real Estate segment, and year-over-year improvements in the contributions from our Pacific Northwest and New Zealand Timber segments more than offset a modestly lower contribution from our Southern Timber segment.
Our cash available for distribution, or CAD, for the first nine months of the year was $204 million versus $124 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher cash taxes and capital expenditures.
Consistent with our nimble approach to capital allocation, we raised $52 million through our at-the-market equity offering program during the third quarter at an average price of $37.26 per share.
In September, we opportunistically repaid the $45 million outstanding under our credit facility with Northwest Farm Credit Services, which previously -- which we had previously assumed in the Pope Resources transaction.
In sum, we closed the third quarter with $420 million of cash and $1.4 billion of debt, both of which exclude cash and debt attributable to the Timber Funds segment, which is nonrecourse to Rayonier.
Our net debt of $957 million represented 15% of our enterprise value based on our closing stock price at the end of the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of $24 million was $2 million below the prior year quarter.
More specifically, volume declined 20% during the third quarter as wet weather conditions, and constraints on trucking availability, hindered production throughout most of the region.
This decline in volume was partially offset by a 12% increase in average sawlog stumpage pricing compared to the prior year quarter.
At slightly over $20 per ton, third quarter pricing reflected the highest average sawlog pricing, we have registered since early 2015.
Specifically, our prices climbed 23% from the prior year quarter in response to strong domestic demand, constrained supply due to wet weather conditions, and an increase in pulpwood exports to China.
Overall, weighted-average pine stumpage prices increased 16% year-over-year, despite a shift toward a higher mix of pulpwood sales as compared to the prior year quarter.
Moving to our Pacific Northwest Timber segment on page 10.
Adjusted EBITDA of $13 million was $3 million above the prior year quarter.
At nearly $108 per ton, our average delivered selling price during the third quarter was up 15% from the prior year quarter.
Meanwhile, pulpwood pricing fell 2% in the third quarter relative to prior year quarter as sawmill residuals remain plentiful, amid strong lumber production.
page 11 shows results and key operating metrics for our New Zealand Timber segment.
Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of $20 million was $2 million above the prior year quarter.
Volume declined 14% in the third quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.
As the government shut down all nonessential activity across New Zealand from August 18 through August 31 due to COVID-19.
Average delivered prices for export sawtimber jumped 59% in the third quarter from the prior year to $150 per ton, reflecting solid demand from China, the ban on Australian log exports to China, and the reduced level European spruce salvage logs into China.
During the third quarter, average delivered sawtimber prices increased 21% from the prior year period to $85 per ton.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, domestic sawtimber prices improved 14% versus the prior year period.
Average domestic pulpwood pricing climbed 25% as compared to the prior year quarter.
Highlighted on page 12, the Timber Funds segment generated consolidated EBITDA of $4 million in the third quarter on harvest volume of 61,000 tons.
Adjusted EBITDA, which reflects the look-through contribution from the timber funds was less than $1 million.
As detailed on page 13, our Real Estate segment delivered exceptionally strong results in the third quarter.
Third quarter real estate sales totaled $93 million on roughly 12,000 acres sold which included a large disposition in Washington, consisting of roughly 8,100 acres.
Excluding this transaction, third quarter sales totaled $73 million on roughly 4,100 acres sold at an average price of over $17,000 per acre.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $64 million.
Sales in the improved development category totaled a record high $28 million in the third quarter.
In our Richmond Hill development project, South of Savannah, Georgia, we closed a $25 million transaction for three entitled industrial parcels at the Belfast Commerce Park near the new Interstate 95 interchange that is adjacent to our property.
This transaction, coupled with the sale of a 153-acre parcel to a national industrial developer last quarter, underscores the strong demand for shovel-ready sites strategically positioned near transportation corridors and in this case, the Port of Savannah.
Meanwhile, within our Wildlight development project north of Jacksonville, Florida, we closed on 42 residential lots, to three different homebuilders, for $2.8 million in total or $66,000 per lot.
Unimproved development sales of $38 million consisted of a 359-acre sale in Kingston, Washington, for roughly $105,000 per acre.
In the rural category, sales totaled just under 3,300 acres at an average price of roughly $2,100 per acre.
Lastly, we closed on a large disposition, comprising roughly 8,100 acres in Washington state during the quarter for $20 million or nearly $2,500 per acre.
We are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $320 million to $330 million, which reflects a 5% increase at the midpoint from our previous guidance, and an 8% increase at the midpoint from the original 2021 guidance we've provided in February.
In our Southern Timber segment, we now expect full year harvest volumes of 5.7 million to 5.8 million tons, as production has been constrained by regional weather conditions and trucking availability.
Overall, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA of $118 million to $120 million in our Southern Timber segment, a slight decrease at the midpoint from prior guidance.
In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we are maintaining our full year volume guidance of 1.7 million to 1.8 million tons.
We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of $53 million to $55 million, a modest increase at the midpoint from prior guidance.
In our New Zealand Timber segment, we now expect full year harvest volumes of 2.5 million to 2.6 million tons as we do not expect to fully recover production loss during the third quarter due to the COVID-19 shutdown.
Overall, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of $75 million to $78 million, a decrease from prior guidance.
In our Real Estate segment, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of $101 million to $104 million, a significant increase from prior guidance.
