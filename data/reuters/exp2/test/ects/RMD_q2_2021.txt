We continue our work here at ResMed to support frontline respiratory therapists and pulmonary physicians, critical care physicians, as well as providers, patients, and ResMedians around the 140-plus countries that we operate in.
I will also review progress toward our ResMed 2025 strategic goals, including execution highlights against our quarterly and annual operating priorities.
During the second quarter of fiscal-year 2021, we generated over $170 million of cash, allowing us to return over $57 million in dividends to shareholders.
We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium and long-term value for our customers, with an industry-leading IP portfolio, including over the 6,000 patents and designs.
We now have over 8 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based Air Solutions Platform.
We have sold over 13.5 million 100% cloud connectable medical devices into the market from ResMed, and we have over 15 million patients enrolled in our AirView Solutions in the cloud.
To be clear, the spectrum of chronic diseases that we look out here at ResMed are, of course, including our core focus areas of sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma, but it also includes biological systems interaction with cardiovascular disease, with cancer, with type 2 diabetes, with neuromuscular disease, Alzheimer's and beyond.
These trends are key to ResMed's 2025 strategy.
We're seeing 70% to 90% of the pre-COVID patient flow coming through our biggest market in the United States, and to take an example of a European country, in Germany, we're already back to 85% to 90-plus percent in some states of Germany of pre-COVID patient flow.
Even in countries like China, in our large Asia region, where we saw the sharpest declines at the start of this crisis with very severe lockdowns in Asia and particularly in China, we're now back to already seeing around 70-plus percent, 70% to 75% of pre-COVID patient flow coming through the mainly hospital clinics in our China market.
The latest data from the European Respiratory Journal, which published during the quarter results from a 30-year study.
It also showed the converse side in that not treating sleep apnea leads to a significantly higher incidence of heart attack, type 2 diabetes, and ischemic heart disease, leading to significantly higher healthcare costs treating those diseases and ultimately leading to earlier death.
We make the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable devices on the market and they are all 100% cloud connectable.
We entered the POC market in 2016 as a way to engage with Stage 2 and Stage 3 COPD patients.
Since then, in these last five years, we have acquired Propeller, giving us access to COPD patients even earlier in their COPD disease progression, including Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD patients.
We have pharmaceutical drug delivery management through Propeller to support COPD patients in Stage 1 and Stage 2 COPD, we have the emergence of high flow therapy for Stage 2 and Stage 3 COPD and we have growing use of noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation to support patients in Stage 3 and Stage 4 COPD.
We were able to pivot our whole team and our HOT business to provide over 150,000 ventilators during the peak needs of the pandemic and get them to where they needed based upon a humanitarian epidemiology model.
And that's where ResMed competes for more than 90% of our business.
With over 1.5 billion people worldwide suffering from sleep apnea, COPD, and asthma combined, we see incredible opportunities for greater and greater adoption of these scalable technologies.
We are poised to continue relentless innovation and development, as well as to provide the global scale that's needed to drive this technology to the 140 countries that we operate in and beyond.
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, and then we get to the Q&A, I want to once again express my sincere genuine gratitude to the more than 7,500 ResMedians, whose perseverance, hard work, and dedication during the incredibly challenging circumstances of 2020 allowed our partners in healthcare to save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency need for ventilation, literally given the gift of breath and the gift of life to many during COVID.
