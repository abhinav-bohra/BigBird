Revenue in the second quarter was 426 million, up 7% from the first quarter and 6% from a year ago.
Revenue upside largely fell to the bottom line with non-GAAP net income of $1 per share, which was also above the top end of our guidance range.
Gross margin was 11.9%, and we continue to anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be within our target range of 12 to 12 and a half percent for the full year.
Optical communications revenue was 322 million, up 6% from the first quarter.
This represented 76% of total revenue, consistent with the first quarter.
Within optical communications, telecom revenue was 248 million, up 8% from the first quarter and 20% from a year ago, and represented 77% of optical revenue.
Datacom revenue in the second quarter was 74 million, a slight increase from Q1, which was better than we had anticipated as demand trends for these products continue to stabilize.
Datacom represented 23% of optical communications revenue.
By technology, silicon photonics-based optical communications revenue increased by 7% from the first quarter to 82 million, and represented 26% of optical communications revenue.
Revenue from QSFP28 and QSFP56 transceivers was 48 million, up 3 million from the first quarter.
By data rate, 100-gig programs represented 49% of optical communications revenue at 159 million, and products rated at speeds of 400 gig and above continued to see rapid growth, up 31% from the first quarter to 49 million.
Looking at our non-optical communications business, revenue of 104 million was up from 97 million in the first quarter, which was also better than expected.
We were pleased to see the demand for industrial lasers improve, and as a result, revenue for these products was also better than expected at 46 million, compared to 41 million in the first quarter.
Automotive revenue moderated to 21 million, reflecting normal quarter-to-quarter variability from next generation automotive programs and which we expect to return to growth in the third quarter.
Sensor revenue increased slightly to 3.9 million from 3.5 million.
Finally, revenue generated from other non-optical applications grew 20% sequentially to 33 million, mainly from Fabrinet West.
While it is still early days, we believe that if this program ramps as anticipated, that Cisco could represent 10% of revenue or more for Fabrinet in fiscal 2021.
Total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 was 426.2 million, above the upper end of our guidance range, and a quarterly record.
Non-GAAP net income was $1 per share, and was also above our guidance range, even after a foreign exchange headwind of 1 million, or approximately $0.03 per share.
Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 11.9%.
Non-GAAP operating expense was 12.3 million in the second quarter.
As a result, non-GAAP operating income was 38.5 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 9%.
Taxes in the quarter was 2 million, and our normalized effective tax rate was less than 5%.
We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be 5 to 6% for the full year.
Non-GAAP net income was above our guidance range at 37.7 million in the second quarter or $1 per diluted share, as I indicated earlier, on a GAAP basis, which includes share base compensation expenses and amortizations of debt issuing costs, net income for the second quarter was 31.2 million or $0.83 per diluted share, also above the high-end of our guidance.
At the end of second quarter, cash, restricted cash, and investments was 450.5 million compared to 436.4 million at the end of the first quarter.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was 50 million, and with capex of 9.1 million, free cash flow was 40.9 million in the second quarter.
62.2 million remain in our share repurchase program.
For the third quarter, we anticipate revenue to be between 410 and 418 million.
From an earnings per share perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.95, and GAAP net income per share of $0.75 to $0.78, based on approximately 37.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding.
