Adjusted gross profit margin increased to 36% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with 35% a year ago.
As a result, of the gross margin expansion and SG&A cost reductions, our operating margin was flat during the quarter despite the 12% decline in sales.
We're also pleased that we generated positive free cash flow of $3.7 million during the quarter.
Net sales for the second quarter were $118 million, a decrease of 12% compared with the second quarter of 2019.
Gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 36%, this was primarily due to favorable price-cost margin and lower operating costs.
Our adjusted operating income decreased 14% to $12.3 million for the quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.23 compared to $0.27 for the second quarter of 2019.
In the Material Handling segment, net sales decreased by 15.7%.
As a result, the segment's adjusted operating income margin increased to 19.5% compared with 18.3% for the second quarter of last year.
In the Distribution segment, sales decreased 2.2% as the incremental sales from the August 2019 acquisition of Tuffy Manufacturing partially offset a decline in sales across the remainder of the segment.
Distribution's adjusted operating income decreased to $1.6 million for the second quarter of this year, compared with $3.3 million a year ago, primarily due to unfavorable sales mix.
As a result, the segment's adjusted operating income margin was 4.4% compared with 8.7% for the second quarter of 2019.
For the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $3.7 million compared with $9.4 million last year.
Working capital as a percent of sales at the end of the second quarter was 9.9%, which was higher than in previous quarters.
Cash on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $72 million and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times, which is consistent with previous quarters.
For the full year, we now anticipate a percentage sales decline in the mid to high single-digit range, which is a slight improvement from our previous expectation of an approximate 10% decline year-over-year.
As I just discussed, we anticipate sales for the full year will be down mid to high single digits, which is a slight improvement over our previous forecast of an approximate 10% decline.
We continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $21 million, net interest expense to be $4 million, a diluted share count of approximately 36 million shares, and capital expenditures to be roughly $15 million.
Lastly, we anticipate an effective tax rate of 26%, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 27%.
