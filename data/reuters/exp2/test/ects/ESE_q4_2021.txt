Our Test business has seen a nice pickup in its overall piece of business, we had double-digit sales growth there in Q4, and we also saw order growth of over 30%, some exciting numbers.
The energy business grew 25% for the full year and the fourth quarter was consistent with that as well.
Sales in the fourth quarter were flat to prior year Q4 with A&D down 16%, USG was up 16% and Test grew 11%.
Adjusted EBIT margins were 13.7% in the quarter compared to 13.9% in the prior year quarter.
Below the EBIT line, we saw interest expense of approximately $800,000 in the quarter compared to nearly $1.5 million in the prior year Q4.
All these items delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.85 per share above prior year's $0.80 per share.
A&D did see sales weakness in the quarter as previously mentioned, the group was down 16%, in the quarter we saw declines in all major markets with commercial aerospace down 15%, space down 10% and the Navy business down 27%.
Orders were up over 25%, as we saw the commercial aerospace driven businesses pick up nicely during the quarter.
USG saw sales growth of 16% in the quarter.
If you exclude the impact of the Q4 acquisitions, the growth was approximately 8%.
The core utility business from Doble was up approximately 4% in the quarter, the renewables business at NRG delivered 29% growth in the quarter capping off a very successful 2021.
The margins from USG were very good in the quarter with adjusted EBIT up to 24.3% in the quarter compared to 18.8% last year.
We saw good orders for USG in Q4 and including the recent acquisitions we move into fiscal '22 with a record backlog position of $92 million.
This compares to $51 million at the end of last year.
The test business also saw strong growth in the quarter with revenues increasing by 11% compared to prior year Q4.
This growth was led by strength in China, which was up over 30%, the Americas also experienced solid growth driven by the power filter business Vic mentioned previously.
We did see margin pressure in this business, during the quarter as adjusted EBIT margins went from 16.8% in the prior year to 15.3% in the current quarter.
On the orders front, we saw continued strength in the pace of business for test, orders were a record $74 million in the quarter, which is an increase of over 35% compared to last year's Q4.
The A&D Group had a full year sales decline of 11%, the main driver of the sales drop was commercial aerospace, which was down 29% for the year, this was somewhat offset by 4% increase from the Navy business.
USG at a full-year sales increase of 6% excluding the fourth quarter acquisitions the growth was 4% and this was driven by 29% growth at NRG.
Test grew by 6% during fiscal '21 and for the full year consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $131 million or 18.3% compared to $133 million and 18.3% in the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $259 million compared to $267 million in the prior year overall of 3% reduction of earnings per share, which is consistent with the underlying sales decline that we experienced.
Orders for the year were $767 million before considering the impact of fourth quarter acquisitions last year's orders were $798 million but included very large in Navy orders received by Globe during 2020.
Backlog ended September 21, is at $592 million compared to $511 million at the end of September 2020.
Year-to-date, operating cash flow achieved a record of $123 million in '21.
We delivered free cash flow conversion at 129% of net earnings in '21 and we'll continue to build on the momentum achieved from our working capital initiatives.
We have seen some good trends developing with orders and are excited to issue guidance that calls for earnings per share in the range of $310 million to $320 million or growth of 20% to 24% in fiscal '22.
This earnings per share range assumes '22 sales in the range of $810 million to $830 million or growth of 13% to 16%.
We expect A&D to grow sales in the range of 10% to 12%, USG to grow in the range of 28% to 32% and test to grow 3% to 5%.
We do have some headwinds next year with increased interest expense to $4 million in a projected tax rate of 23% to 24%, but the plan still deliver strong earnings per share in spite of these items.
