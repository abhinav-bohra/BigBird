Under the leadership of our newly expanded management team, which had been in place just 75 days before the pandemic took hold, we made significant progress on our historic transformation executing on our strategy, and operating in four new segments.
We also ended 2020 with a lowest net debt in 2.5 years and paid our regular quarterly dividend demonstrating our disciplined stewardship and financial strength.
We reported revenue of $1.79 billion for the full year 2020, a decline of 11% compared to 2019.
You will note, at our Q1 earnings call we had forecasted 20% adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year 2020; fast-forward nine months later, I'm very pleased to report that we achieved this goal delivering adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.4% for the full year, despite the macroeconomic impact from COVID.
Now, I would like to take a moment to review the 4 core pillars of our strategy.
In 2020 we signed more than 3,900 deals.
In fact, since we began One Deluxe, we sold 6 of the Top 10 deals of the last decade, including the largest sale in the company's history.
In our telesales centers, we delivered record average order value growing 7.5% over last year, and our sales team find more than 200 cross sell deals totaling $35 million in total contract value.
We saw $31 million of personal protective equipment in 2020, a business we had not been in previously, where we had no source of supply, no way to book an order, and no sales training at the beginning of the pandemic; it's a great example of innovative thinking, and speed this organization can now deliver.
We closed an additional 24 sites during the year, reducing our location count by 60% in the last two years.
The result, we delivered EBITDA margin in line with our commitments, reduced net debt to it's lowest level in 2.5 years, and we continue to invest for growth.
Our total revenue in the quarter was $454.5 million, a decline of 12.9% as compared to the same period last year; however, an increase of 3% from the third quarter.
For the full year, total revenue declined 10.8% to $1.791 billion.
We reported GAAP net income of $24.7 million in the quarter, and $8.8 million for the full year.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $94.9 million resulting in $364.5 million for the full year.
Adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter was 20.9% bringing full year performance 20.4%.
As previously committed, our cost containment initiatives improved our adjusted EBITDA margin performance from the first quarter low by more than 300 basis points, this brought both Q4 and full year adjusted EBITDA margin into the low end of our pre-pandemic long-term adjusted EBITDA margin guidance range.
Promotional expanded revenue went to 15%, sequentially versus Q3 and Check maintained a strong EBITDA margin despite significant COVID-related headwinds to the business.
Consistent with our expectations and as we had shared at the third quarter call, payments grew Q4 revenue 3% to $78 million as compared to prior year, achieving 12% growth for the year and ending at $301.9 million.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased in the quarter and for the full year by $4.5 million and $6.3 million respectively.
For the year, adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.6%, well within the range of our pre-pandemic guide on slightly lower revenue performance.
We continue to invest to drive growth and as such we're assuming adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 20% area through the year.
Cloud solutions revenue declined 27.1% to $59.2 million in the quarter and ended the year at $252.8 million, resulting in a decline of 20.6% compared to 2019.
In Q4, cloud achieved a 160 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin versus prior year, and expanded 20 basis points to 24.4% for the full year reflecting solid performance against pre-pandemic guide on significantly less revenue.
We expect the loss of revenue associated with Q4 2020 product exits will continue to impact the business into 2021, but we anticipate cloud margins to remain healthy in the low-to-mid 20% range.
Promotional Solutions fourth quarter 2020 sequential revenue grew by 15.3% from Q3 to $144 million, the year-over-year rate of decline moderated to down 16.6%, reflecting the continued impact of market conditions.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 14%, down from the prior quarter peak.
Full year revenue declined 17.4% to $529.6 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.6%, and was greatly impacted by macroeconomic conditions in 2020.
Checks fourth quarter revenue declined 10% from last year to $173.3 million due to the secular trend combined with the impact of the pandemic.
Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin levels of 48.1% held largely steady versus Q3 declining only 10 basis points sequentially despite lower revenue levels, but remained lower than 2019 levels as a result of increased selling costs, new wins, and technology investments in support of our One Deluxe strategy.
Full year Check revenue declined 9.4% to $706.5 million as compared to last year, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 48.4%.
Free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $155 million for 2020, a decline of $65.1 million as compared to last year.
We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $425 million, including $123 million in cash.
During the quarter we reduced the amount drawn under the credit facility by $200 million, ending the year with $840 million drawn, a reduction of $44 million in the year resulting net debt continue to decrease through the year ending at $717 million, the lowest level in 2.5 years.
Our Board approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share on all outstanding shares.
All of this means, we expect to achieve full-year 2021 revenue growth of 0% to 2% with full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%.
We expect to invest approximately $90 million in CapEx to continue with important transformation work, innovation investments in building future scale across all our product categories.
