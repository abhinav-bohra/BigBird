In Q4, we reported revenues of approximately $1.5 billion for the quarter.
This represents a 9.9% decline versus last year and a considerable sequential improvement when comparing to our more than 15% decline in Q3.
Our Technology & Manufacturing industry group grew almost 7% and Business & Industry as well as Education posted revenue results that were only slightly down.
Income from continued operations grew to $53.1 million or $0.78 per share.
On an adjusted basis, we delivered $46.7 million or $0.69 per share.
Adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 6.2% versus 5.6% last year.
This had 120 basis point impact on our adjusted EBITDA margin as well as our earnings.
As a company that's been around for more than 110 years, ABM has withstood and grown during many global events.
As an example, our approach to collections led us to generate more than $450 million in cash flow from operations and $420 million in free cash flow, both records for the firm.
This translates to nearly $1 billion of liquidity, including $400 million of cash, which is an extremely powerful position to be in during still uncertain times.

Since Sean's arrival in ABM in 2017, we've broken sales records each succeeding year and we achieved another record in 2020 with new sales at $1.2 billion, an amazing accomplishment for any year but especially in a year when so much of the economy was paused.
On that front, from a payback standpoint, we concluded the year with over $300 million in sales for our EnhancedClean program and COVID-related activities.
For the first quarter, we expect GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 to $0.58 in earnings per diluted share or adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share.
These ranges compare to last year's $0.41 and $0.39 respectively, both considerable increases on a year-over-year basis.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 6.1% to 6.4%, expanding from 4.3% last year.
We not only exceeded our pre-COVID expectations, but actually accelerated into a long-term EBITDA margin range of 5.5% to 6%.
Revenue for the quarter were $1.5 billion, a total decrease of approximately 9.9% compared to last year, reflecting our second full quarter of COVID-19 revenue declines, particularly in the Aviation and Technical Solutions segment.
GAAP income from continuing operations was $53.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share compared to $48.1 million or $0.71 last year.
We saw a benefit of $21.3 million in self-insurance adjustments, of which $6.2 million was related to the current year.
On an adjusted basis, income from continued operations for the quarter increased to $46.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share compared to $44.7 million or $0.66 last year.
Partially offsetting these results was a $17.6 million reserve for notes receivables for a project related to a unique family entertainment customer within the Technical Solutions segment.
This amount was approximately $10 million for the quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter also experienced one less workday which equates to approximately $6 million in labor expense savings.
But the number of days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 will be comparable at 65 days.
Our overall performance during the quarter led to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $92.5 million at a margin rate of 6.2% compared to $93 million or 5.6% last year.
B&I revenues were $794.3 million, down just 1.6%.
We're encouraged by the sequential top line improvement compared to a decline of 6.3% last quarter.
This led to a more favourable mix of B&I business that led to operating profit growth of more than 65% to $84.7 million with a margin rate of 10.7%.
Revenues were $245.5 million for the quarter, up 6.7% versus last year.
Operating profit grew more than 30% to $23.5 million for an operating margin of 9.6%.
In education, we reported revenue of $212.2 million, reflecting the new school season and the adoption of hybrid models across our K-12 and higher education portfolios.
Operating profit of $15.1 million or 7.1% margin reflects labor-related savings as a result of modified staffing at site locations during the pandemic.
Aviation reported revenues of $141 million, and an operating profit of $3.5 million, clearly demonstrating how the pandemic continues to have a dramatic impact on the industry.
And now onto Technical Solutions, which reported revenues of $123.1 million compared to $175.5 million last year.
As a reminder, this segment experienced phenomenal growth last year, exceeding 25% during Q4 of fiscal '19.
Backlog remains in our healthy zone, which we've historically defined as above the $150 million.
The operating loss of $3.6 million was driven by a reserve of notes receivables related to a single entertainment customer and associated with the client increasing credit risk resulting from the pandemic, which we continue to pursue.
During the quarter, we generated a record $198.7 million in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $189.6 million for the quarter.
This led to $457.5 million in cash flow and $419.5 million of free cash flow for the year.
As a reminder, these results include $101 million in deferred U.S. payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, which will be due in 2021 and 2022.
Due to our strong cash position, we ended the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit of $883.4 million and a bank adjusted leverage ratio of 2.1 times.
Additionally, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $394.2 million.
During the quarter, we paid our 218th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for a total distribution of approximately $12.3 million.

At this time, we expect GAAP earnings per share to be in a range of $0.53 to $0.58 and adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.60 to $0.65.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is anticipated to be between 6.1% to 6.4%.
The first quarter will see the same level of investments that we saw during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of approximately $10 million.
The first quarter will also have one less working day versus last year, which could lead to approximately $6 million in lower labor expense.
The tax rate for the quarter is anticipated to be approximately 30%.
This rate excludes discrete tax items such as the work opportunity tax credit and a tax impact of stock-based compensation awards, the total impact of which we currently expect will be under $1 million in Q1.
Lastly, related to taxes, in fiscal '20, our full-year impact for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit was $4 million, reflecting the pandemic's impact on traditional hiring practices.
