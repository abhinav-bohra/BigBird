We continue to expect to average at least 4% in U.S. organic tenant billings growth from 2021 through 2027 on a reported basis, implying an average of at least 5%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn.
And as part of these projections, we anticipate an acceleration in U.S. organic tenant billings growth between 2023 and 2027, when we are targeting growth rates of at least 5% on a reported basis and at least 6%, excluding the Sprint churn.
Similarly, on the AFFO side of the equation, we believe we are on track to average at least 10% growth in AFFO per share, on average through 2027.
carriers for critical mid-band spectrum and over $65 billion in capex deployed by carriers into network investments across our global footprint.
With mobile data consumption expected to grow at an average annual rate of more than 25% over the next five years in the United States and at even higher rates in some of our international markets, we anticipate prolonged network investment cycles to drive compelling, sustained growth rates across our regions.
As part of our commitment to growing our assets and capabilities to meet our customers' needs, we deployed more than $10 billion for tower M&A in 2021 focused on Europe, where we have meaningfully improved our long-term strategic positioning.
We saw accelerated organic growth trends in the region throughout the last year, and we expect those trends to continue, supported by data growth projected at a CAGR of 26% over the next five years across our major European markets.
In addition to expanding through M&A, we further grew our asset base through our internal capex program by investing $1.4 billion, primarily to construct a record of nearly 6,400 new communication sites, along with deploying nearly $120 million toward our energy efficiency investments, primarily in Africa.
These targets represent direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 40% by 2035 against the 2019 baseline, as well as targets to reduce indirect supply chain emissions by at least 40%.
To date, we've invested over $275 million in capex toward energy efficiency and reduction solutions, which directly support our committed targets and initiatives.
We're a member of the World Economic Forum's Edison Alliance 1 Billion Lives Challenge, which aims to spur development of affordable and accessible digital solutions across health, finance, and education to the underserved.
At the end of 2021, we reached a significant milestone of launching our 200th digital community in India and have set a goal to grow to 2,000 digital communities globally over the next five years, focusing on education, healthcare access, financial inclusion, and career development.
For the full year, we posted consolidated and attributable AFFO per share growth of 13.7% and 11.7%, respectively.
I'll also note, this is a great start toward achieving our previously stated objective of delivering, on average, double-digit AFFO per share growth between 2021 and 2027.
And in 2021, we saw average day one NOI yield of nearly 12% over the nearly 6,400 sites we constructed.
Turning to Slide 8.
In the fourth quarter, our consolidated property revenues grew by more than 13% year over year or over 14% on an FX-neutral basis.
In our U.S. and Canada segment, property revenue grew 1.2%.
This included an organic tenant billings growth decline of 0.5% or an increase of over 4% when excluding the impacts of Sprint churn.
International property revenues grew over 28%, with nearly 20% driven by contributions from our Telxius assets.
International organic tenant billings growth was 5.7%, led by Latin America at 7.4%, followed by Africa at 7.3%, and Europe at 6.6%.
APAC grew for the second consecutive quarter, coming in at 1.3%.
This was complemented by the addition of nearly 1,900 high-yielding, newly constructed sites across our international markets.
Growth was over 10% in the quarter, while the impacts of Sprint churn, combined with the addition of newer, lower-tenancy assets, drove a decline in adjusted EBITDA margin to 62%.
Finally, consolidated AFFO per share grew 3.8% in the quarter or 4.3%, excluding the negative impacts of foreign currency fluctuations.
This included nearly $140 million of year-on-year cash-adjusted EBITDA growth, which was partially offset by the higher net cash interest expense, along with higher cash taxes and maintenance costs.
Meanwhile, AFFO per share attributable to American Tower common stockholders grew by 1.4% in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 9.
Full year consolidated property revenue growth was 14.5%, including organic tenant billings growth of 3.8% and total tenant billings growth of 11.3%.
U.S. and Canada property revenue growth was nearly 9%, with organic tenant billings growth of 2.9%.
This included contributions from co-locations and amendments of 3.2%; another 3% in growth from escalators; around 0.2% in negative impacts from other run-rate items; and churn of 3%, which consisted of around 1.8% in normal cost churn and the balance driven by Sprint.
This was complemented by new asset contributions to tenant billings of 4.1% and approximately $144 million in higher straight-line revenues as compared to 2020.
Our international property revenue grew by over 21% with organic tenant billings growth of 5.5% for the year.
Overall colocation and amendment growth was 5.9%, while 3.8% came from escalators and 0.3% from other run-rate items, all of which was partially offset by 4.5% of churn.
This segment contributed approximately $23 million to our total property revenue in 2021.
Turning to Slide 10.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 16% for the year to nearly $6 billion.
On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were down around 20 basis points as compared to 2020, primarily due to the impacts of Sprint churn in the U.S. and the addition of newer lower tenancy international assets, which we believe are well-positioned to drive meaningful margin expansion over time.
We also grew consolidated AFFO by 15.4% and consolidated AFFO per share by 13.7% in 2021, with over $680 million in cash-adjusted EBITDA growth from the drivers I just mentioned.
Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders per share grew 11.7% year over year.
First, we expect a strong year of new leasing activity across our operations, with anticipated gross new business contributions to total tenant billings growth nearly 7% higher than what we saw in 2021.
In the United States, this will be driven by Sprint churn we've discussed previously, with about $160 million in year-over-year impacts in 2022 versus 2021.
And finally, our initial outlook reflects estimated negative translational FX impacts of approximately $125 million for property revenue, $70 million for adjusted EBITDA, and $55 million for consolidated AFFO versus 2021.
Moving into the details on Slide 11, you can see we expect total property revenues of over $10.3 billion at the midpoint, representing growth of 13% or nearly 15% on a currency-neutral basis.
and Canada and over 14% of FX-neutral growth in our international regions.
We also expect data centers to contribute roughly $705 million of growth in cash revenue to the property segment in 2022.
Turning to Slide 12, and unpacking the property revenue growth assumptions a bit, you'll see our expected organic tenant billings growth rates for 2022.
Looking at the United States and Canada, we anticipate growth of approximately 1%, in line with the 2022 expectations implied in the long-term projections we presented last year.
This includes contributions to growth from colocations and amendments of roughly $150 million, representing solid double-digit growth versus 2021.
We expect this to be partially offset by churn of over 5%, which includes a 3.7% impact associated with Sprint.
We expect organic tenant billings growth of greater than 6% for the year, supported by solid gross colocation and amendment activity as well as additional growth from our CPI-based escalators, which we anticipate to be around 300 basis points higher than in 2021.
Organic tenant billings growth is expected to be in the 6% range.
We continue to see strong demand for our macro tower assets driving colocation and amendment growth of around 6.5% for the year.
In addition, we expect escalators to be up as compared to 2021 by roughly 90 basis points.
Meanwhile, in Europe, we're seeing the benefits of added scale from the Telxius acquisition, the early stages of 5G rollouts, and low churn, all driving expected organic tenant billings growth of approximately 9% in 2022.
This includes roughly 6% in contributions from colocations and amendments and escalators of around 4.5%.
Churn is expected to decline to around 1.5% as we benefit from the lower-churn Telxius assets and reduced cancellations across our legacy business as carrier consolidation events wind down.
Finally, in Asia Pacific, we're guiding to 2% to 3% organic tenant billings growth in 2022, including churn of around 5%, representing less than half of the 2021 churn rate.
Turning to Slide 13.
At the midpoint of our outlook, we're projecting adjusted EBITDA of over $6.5 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10% or nearly 11% on a constant currency basis.
We continue to drive solid organic growth conversion rates and are complementing this through growth on assets acquired in 2021, including approximately $360 million in expected adjusted EBITDA from CoreSite in 2022.
Turning to Slide 14, we expect consolidated AFFO to grow by more than $380 million to over $4.7 billion, despite absorbing approximately $160 million in negative impacts to AFFO from Sprint churn.
This includes $675 million in FX-neutral cash-adjusted EBITDA growth and the expectation for maintenance capex to be more or less flat as compared to 2021 as capital intensity remains in the 2% range.
We expect this to be partially offset by approximately $55 million in higher cash taxes and $185 million in incremental cash interest expense, primarily associated with our preliminary CoreSite financing assumption as well as roughly $55 million in expected negative translational FX impacts.
Taking these assumptions into account, we expect our consolidated AFFO per share for the year to be $10.05, reflecting growth of 4%, or roughly 8%, excluding the impacts of Sprint churn.
Finally, AFFO attributable to AMT common stockholders is expected to grow approximately 3% year over year to $9.70 per share in 2022.
This includes an assumption of approximately $165 million in minority interest impacts related to our partnerships in Europe.
Moving on to Slide 15, let's review our capital deployment in 2021 and expectations for 2022.
In 2021, we declared nearly $2.4 billion of common dividend distributions, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 15%.
We spent another $1.4 billion through our capex programs, over $500 million of which was dedicated to our development projects, including the construction of nearly 6,400 new sites across the globe.
Finally, we deployed over $20 billion, including the assumption of debt to acquire the Telxius and CoreSite assets as well as a handful of smaller transactions around the world.
And subject to board approval, we expect to distribute approximately $2.8 billion to our shareholders, as we continue to increase the dividend in line with our stated long-term, double-digit growth targets.
We also expect to deploy roughly $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, over 90% of which will be discretionary.
Of our total discretionary capital spending, we expect approximately $270 million to be directed toward attractive organic development opportunities in our data center segment.
On the tower side, we expect to deploy roughly $565 million in development capex, primarily for the construction of 6,500 sites in our International segment.
Similar to 2021, we anticipate driving average day one NOI yields on these new builds of nearly 12%.
In our earliest vintage, we're seeing average NOI yields of 46%.
Sites built between 2010 and 2014 are yielding around 26%.
And on the more than 26,000 sites we've constructed since the start of 2015, we're seeing yields in the 20% range, with room to expand as we continue to drive lease-up on these lower-tenured sites.
Turning now to Slide 16, we've laid out our current thoughts around the permanent financing strategy for our CoreSite acquisition.
With that said, for the purposes of our initial 2022 outlook, we have assumed that roughly half of the $10 billion purchase price will be financed through a common equity issuance assumed to occur in the first half of 2022.
Turning now to Slide 17, and in summary, we drove strong results in 2021, including compelling double-digit AFFO per share growth, record new build activity prudent, balance sheet management, and the completion of several transactions that we believe will enhance American Tower's leading global position.
