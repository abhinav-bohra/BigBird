1 retailer for home improvement.
We've seen several inflection points in our company's history, all spurred by a desire to maintain the growth mentality and entrepreneurial spirit created by Bernie and Arthur when they revolutionized the home improvement industry over 40 years ago.
Approximately 15 years ago, we pivoted from new stores as a driver of growth to growth driven by productivity.
We could have never predicted the more than $40 billion in growth since the end of 2019.
Aligned with these objectives, our goals are: first, to grow the business to $200 billion in sales, which represents incremental growth of approximately $50 billion from where we are today; and second, and just as importantly, deliver best-in-class operating profit dollar growth and return on invested capital.
Over the last two years, as we've grown by over $40 billion in sales, our addressable market has also grown.
We now estimate that our total addressable market in North America is greater than $900 billion.
We estimate that each of these respective customer groups represent about 50% of the total addressable market.
We also estimate that each of these important customer groups represent approximately 50% of our total sales.
For Pro, we believe this addressable end market is over $450 billion.
Within this end market, we believe our addressable maintenance, repair, and operations, or MRO space, has expanded to over $100 billion.
1 home improvement retailer across all of our geographies, we represent a relatively small part of a large and fragmented total addressable market that has expanded significantly over the past two years.
At this point, we saw their spend with The Home Depot grow to more than $100,000 annually but still for mostly unplanned immediate need purchases in store.
As a result, we've seen spend with this customer more than triple to over $300,000 annually.
We believe the ability to serve our Pros' planned and unplanned purchase occasions will be an important driver of growth as we work toward a $200 billion sales milestone.
When I think about our stores, I think about the tremendous amount of productivity over the years, all of which helped us achieve over $600 in sales per retail square foot in 2021.
As we set our sights on our goal of $200 billion in sales, we have many opportunities to improve freight flow throughout the store and drive further space optimization in SKU productivity.
When our founders started The Home Depot over 40 years ago, they transformed an industry.
