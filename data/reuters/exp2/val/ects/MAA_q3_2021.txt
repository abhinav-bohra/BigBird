New move-ins, year-to-date, from households relocating to our Sunbelt markets, constitute 14% of our new leases as compared to just over 10% in the same time frame of 2020.
In the third quarter, move-outs among our resident base to buy a home, were down 12% as compared to prior year, and move-outs to rent a home, were down 38%.
Blended lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter was up 15%.
As a result, all in-place rents or effective rent growth, on a year-over-year basis, grew 6.3%.
This is nearly five times the 1.3% growth of the first quarter.
In addition, average daily occupancy for the quarter was a strong 96.4%.
For the full year 2021, we expect to complete just over 6,000 interior unit upgrades and installed 22,000 Smart Home packages.
This will bring our total number of smart units up to 47,000 units.
new lease-over-lease pricing month to date for October is running close to 20% ahead of the rent on the prior lease.
Renewal lease pricing in October is running 13% ahead of the prior lease.
As a result, blended pricing for the portfolio is up approximately 16%, so far, for October.
Average daily occupancy for the month is currently 95.9%, which is 30 basis points better than October of last year.
Exposure, which is all vacant units, plus notices through a 60-day period, is just 6.8%.
This is 10 basis points better than prior year.
Our prepurchase and development pipeline that includes both under construction and in lease-up projects, stands at 2,999 units, with a total cost of $710 million.
Despite inflationary pressures on materials and labor, we expect stabilized NOI yields on our new projects to remain in the 5.5 to 5.75 range.
However, we expect these supply chain disruptions could add 60 days or so to any new starts next year.
Pricing on these 31-year-old assets is very strong, generating a levered investment IRR of 30%.
Core FFO was $0.10 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range, with the outperformance essentially, all coming from revenue.
Run and lease pricing for the third quarter was five percent higher than projections, supported by an average physical occupancy about 50 basis points above projections.
We increased projected core FFO for the year to $6.94 per share, which is $0.19 per share above our prior midpoint and now represents a 7.9% growth over the prior year.
The increase is driven by revised Same Store revenue growth projection for the full year of 5.1% at the midpoint, which is based on continued strong-pricing trends through the fourth quarter with some late seasonal moderation expected, and we're assuming blended lease pricing averaging somewhere around 10% for full quarter.
We left our operating expense expectation for the year unchanged at 4.25% and 4.75% growth, which produces revised Same Store NOI growth for the year of 5.5% at the midpoint.
We do expect some growing pressure from operating expenses as we move into 2022 with personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs and real estate taxes, which combined to make up over 2/3 of operating expenses, all expected to begin showing some inflationary increases during 2022.
We issued a combined $600 million in public bonds during the quarter, a barbell deal pairing five-year and 30-year notes, which had very good pricing for both, have lended to a 2.1% effective rate, which supports our view that our current ratings are conservative.
These transactions also fixed over 99% of our debt and extended our average debt maturities to almost nine years, providing employee protection from a rising interest rate environment.
We also executed an 18-month forward equity transaction, which provides around $210 million of future funding for our growing development pipeline, and based on current projections, this takes care of our equity needs for the next couple of years.
