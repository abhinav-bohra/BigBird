These actions have strengthened our position and diversified our revenue base with approximately 57% of our first quarter consolidated revenues generated outside of the U.S. land E&P market.
I'd like to highlight that our Cleansorb subsidiary, acquired last year, was recently awarded a contract extending our supply of patented breaker products in Saudi Arabia for an additional 2 years.
The energy infrastructure and other non-E&P markets now generates roughly 60% of our total Mats segment revenue while the revenue contributed from oil-focused basins has declined to less than 20%.
Our Fluids Systems performance is relatively in line with expectation posting first quarter 2020 revenues of $133 million, relatively flat sequentially.
North American Fluid System revenues improved $4 million sequentially as seasonal strength in Canada, and continued growth of IOCs in the Gulf of Mexico were largely offset by a $7 million sequential decrease in U.S. land.
For the first quarter, U.S. land contributed $58 million of revenue in Fluids Systems.
Outside of North America, revenues pulled back by $6 million sequentially to $46 million in the first quarter, reflecting a combination of the anticipated timing of customer activities as discussed on February's call, as well as the unanticipated COVID-related delays in March.
Product sales declined by $23 million sequentially to $4 million in the first quarter.
And finally, I'd like to note that consistent with our plans identified on February's call, we began to address our December 2021 convertible notes maturity purchasing 15% of our outstanding bonds during the quarter.
We ended the first quarter with a net debt of $114 million, including a cash balance of $49 million and a total debt balance of $163 million.
In the Fluids Systems segment, revenues from U.S. land declined 10% sequentially to $58 million in the first quarter, reflecting a combination of a 4% reduction in U.S. land rig count, a modest softening in market share and a decline in the number of wells drilled per rig with the declines being felt across most U.S. land basins.
The softness in U.S. land was partially offset by a stronger contribution from the offshore market as Gulf of Mexico revenues improved to $16 million in the first quarter, reflecting a $3 million sequential increase.
In Canada, revenues reflected the typical Q1 seasonal uptick, improving to $13 million in the first quarter, an $8 million sequential increase.
Outside of North America, as we discussed on February's call, due to the timing of activities within key contracts, our international revenues pulled back 12% sequentially to $46 million in the first quarter with operations in the Middle East and Africa showing the largest declines.
On a year-over-year basis, our Fluids Systems revenues declined 17% compared to Q1 of 2019.
This $28 million decline includes a $39 million reduction in U.S. land revenues, offset by $10 million of growth in the Gulf of Mexico, which benefited from our expansion into completion fluids, while our international revenues have also increased 4% year-over-year.
Overall, we've reduced our U.S. Fluids workforce by nearly 30% year-to-date while also implementing furloughs and reductions in employee compensation and benefits, collectively reducing our annualized personnel expenses by approximately $25 million.
While the majority of these actions were taken within the past month, our first quarter Fluid Systems results included $1.2 million of charges related to inventory writedowns and employee separation costs as highlighted in yesterday's release, resulting in a $2 million operating loss and EBITDA of $3 million in the first quarter.
Total segment revenues declined 42% sequentially to $32 million in the first quarter, largely reflecting the anticipated pullback in product sales following the record fourth quarter result.
As Paul touched on, in addition to the anticipated pullback in product sales from the strong Q4 demand, our first quarter was negatively impacted by a number of orders totaling more than $10 million in revenues being delayed by customers citing COVID-19 uncertainty, resulting in $4 million of product sales in the quarter.
From a mix perspective, roughly 60% of our total segment revenues in the quarter was derived from the energy infrastructure in other non-E&P markets.
Of the $13 million of revenues derived from E&P markets, more than half of that was generated in the gas-focused basins in the Northeast.
Comparing to the first quarter of last year, Mats segment revenues declined $19 million, largely reflecting a $14 million rental and service revenue decline in the U.S. land E&P markets along with a $4 million decline in product sales.
With the $23 million sequential decline in product sales, the Mats segment operating income declined to $12 million as compared to the fourth quarter, resulting in first quarter operating income of $3 million and EBITDA of $8 million.
Total corporate office expenses declined $2.3 million sequentially to $6.7 million in the first quarter as compared to $9 million in the fourth quarter.
The sequential decline was driven in part by lower charges associated with workforce reductions as the first quarter includes $200,000 in severance charges as compared to $1.1 million in the fourth quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, corporate office expenses declined by $5 million, primarily reflecting the impact of a $3.4 million charge in the prior year associated with a retirement policy change along with lower legal and professional spending and personnel costs.
SG&A costs were $25 million in the first quarter compared to $28 million in the fourth quarter and $31 million in the first quarter of last year.
The year-over-year decline largely reflects the $4 million charge for retirement policy change in the prior year, as well as lower personnel expense and legal and professional spending.
We purchased $14.5 million par value of our convertible notes for $13.8 million during the first quarter.
However, despite purchasing the notes at a $700,000 discount to par, the accounting rules required a $1.6 million non-cash write-off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs associated with the purchase notes, resulting in a $900,000 loss on the extinguishment of debt.
With the benefit of the decline in interest rates and the convertible note repurchases, interest expense declined to $3.2 million in the first quarter, of which roughly half reflects non-cash amortization of facility fees and discounts.
As of the end of the first quarter, the weighted average cash borrowing rate on our debt facilities was approximately 3.2%.
The first quarter provision for income taxes was $200,000 despite reporting a pre-tax loss of $12 million in the period.
This compares to a net loss of $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter, which includes charges of $0.19.
Net income was $0.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year.
While the duration and magnitude of the ongoing health pandemic are very difficult to predict, we currently estimate our international revenues will decline by at least $10 million sequentially in the second quarter.
It's important to highlight that the majority of the invested capital in the Fluids business consists of inventories and receivables with the segment carrying roughly $250 million of net working capital as of quarter end.
Regarding corporate office spending, we expect Q2 expenses will remain near the $7 million level.
First quarter cash provided by operating activities was $4 million, substantially all of which is attributable to a net decrease in working capital.
Cash used in investing activities totaled $3 million in the quarter, which consistent with the previous quarter demonstrates our ability to adjust course in managing our net capital investments and cash flow.
In light of the changing market conditions, we have eliminated all non-critical capital investments, which we expect will reduce our total capital spend for the remainder of 2020 to roughly $10 million.
Further, with the anticipated market softness, we expect strong cash generation from reductions in our roughly $280 million of net working capital, particularly as we right-size our U.S. Fluids business.
Our leverage remains modest with total debt balance of $163 million and a cash balance of $49 million as of the end of March, resulting in a total debt-to-capital ratio of 24% and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 18%.
Our primary debt components include the remaining $86 million of convertible notes due December 2021 and $79 million outstanding on our U.S. asset-based bank facility, which runs to 2024.
We currently have $82 million of availability on this facility.
Although substantially all of our $49 million of cash on hand resides in our international subsidiaries, we are executing actions intended to reduce this balance in the coming quarters and we plan to use the repatriated cash to reduce our outstanding debt.
First, we will continue to provide outstanding service to our E&P and non-E&P customers around the world, whether we are providing access solutions to utility companies in North America, or drilling support to our oil and gas companies in the desert of Algeria, or an 8,000 feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico, outstanding service quality has always been and will continue to be a hallmark of Newpark.
