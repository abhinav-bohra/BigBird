Participants are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of today, August 4, 2021.
Turning to our outstanding Q2 performance on slide 3; this quarter was a good example of what we can deliver when all our core lines of business are on the upward trajectory, particularly our disposal network.
Adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was a record $187.8 million, up 36% from a year ago.
Our margins increased 80 basis points to 20.3% reflecting the benefits of pricing initiatives and cost reduction efforts.
Adjusted free cash flow was a strong at $114.6 million.
Turning to our segments beginning with Environmental Services on slide 4, revenues grew 18% on growth in disposal volumes and strong industrial services activity.
Industrial Services performed particularly well, posting revenue growth of more than 50% as a backlog of deferred maintenance projects began to come to market.
Government assistance programs totaled $4.4 million in the quarter, down from $19.7 million in Q2 a year ago.
Incineration utilization was 87%, flat with the prior year, but up nicely from 80% in Q1, which was affected by weather-related shutdowns that disrupted six of our nine incinerators.
Mix of waste, along with pricing initiatives pushed our average price up 5% from a year ago.
Landfill volumes rose 13% in the quarter as we finally saw increased activity within our project pipeline.
And we also benefited from a 10% jump in average pricing.
COVID decon revenue in Q2 was $11 million, with most of that coming in the early -- in the quarter.
The pace of parts washer services continue to pick up as we hit 240,000 services for the first time since the pandemic began.
Moving to slide 5, SKSS revenue more than doubled.
On a sequential basis, SKSS revenue increased more than 30% from Q1, fueled by strong demand for our base oil.
Adjusted EBITDA climbed by nearly $55 million year-over-year, while margin soared more than 31% -- to more than 31%, excuse me, reflecting the widening of our rerefining spread and a return to more normal production levels.
Waste oil collections continue to ramp up nicely during the quarter, coming in at 57 million gallons, compared with 43 million gallons a year ago, and 47 million gallons in Q1.
HPC is planning for $744 million of revenue this year and approximately $115 million of adjusted EBITDA.
As a result, we expect to achieve $40 million plus of synergies after our first full year of operating HPC, which would translate to a purchase multiple of about 8.1 times on a post-synergized basis.
Turning to slide 7, the reasons behind this transaction, which we expect to close later this year are many.
On the field services side, which accounts for about 15% of their total revenues, HPC brings a strong presence in utility vertical that will complement our nationwide field services organization.
Moving to slide 8, another important announcement we made today is that we're officially moving forward ahead with our plans to build a new 70,000 ton incinerator and Kimball, Nebraska.
With an expected cost of about $180 million, this project will be the largest internal investment in our history.
Here on slide 9 on the upper left, you can see a nice aerial shot of the Kimball site today with the existing kiln.
We have a strong relationship with the Kimball community given our 25-year plus ownership of our existing incinerator at that site.
Turning to slide 10, given our strong cash flow, cash balance and low leverage, we've been in an excellent position to execute our capital allocation strategy.
Turning to our income statement on slide 12, we delivered exceptional results this quarter.
Revenue increased 30% year-over-year on the strength of greater volumes, higher pricing, especially in base and blended products and a meaningful pickup in our Service businesses.
Adjusted EBITDA grew an impressive 36% to $187.8 million.
Our revenue mix, widened rerefining spread, SG&A cost reduction programs and $5.2 million in government assistance resulted in an 80 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin as we exceeded 20% for the quarter.
If you back the government money out of both periods, our EBITDA margin improved from 16.2% a year ago to 19.7% this past quarter.
SG&A costs increased by approximately $20 million year-over-year, reflecting the $216 million increase in revenues.
On a percentage basis, we improved our SG&A by 120 basis points.
Depreciation and amortization in Q2 declined slightly to $71.6 million, in line with our expectations.
For 2021 we continue to anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of $280 million to $290 million.
Income from operations increased by 83% reflecting a high revenue growth coupled with prior year cost initiatives.
Turning to slide 13, our balance sheet at June 30 remained in excellent shape.
Cash and short-term marketable securities at quarter end were $666.3 million, up approximately $95 million from year-end and from March 31.
Our debt was $1.55 billion at quarter end with leverage on a net debt basis approaching 1.5 times.
Our weighted average cost of debt before factoring in the HydroChem transaction is 4.2% with no debt maturities until 2024.
To finance the all-cash HydroChem deal, we intend to issue $1 billion of additional debt and fund the remainder between cash on hand and free cash flow we generate from now until the deal closes.
Based on our current guidance and assuming the deal closes in Q4, we will anticipate ending the year somewhere around 3.3 times levered with a target of lowering that net debt leverage into the mid-2s by year-end 2022.
Turning to Q2 cash flows on slide 14, cash from operations in Q2 was extremely strong at $162.4 million.
Capex, net of disposals, was up slightly year-over-year at $47.8 million, was in line with our expectations.
The result of all these efforts was a record Q2 adjusted free cash flow of $114.6 million.
For 2021, we now expect net capex in the range of $190 million to $210 million, which reflects the addition of some initial spend on the Kimball incinerator.
During the second quarter, we bought back 200,000 shares at a total cost of $18.9 million.
Of our $600 million authorization, we now have more than $150 million remaining.
Moving to slide 15; based on our Q2 results and current market conditions, we are raising our 2021 guidance.
We now expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $620 million to $650 million with a midpoint of $635 million.
That said, these factors are not enough to offset the year-over-year decline in high margin decontamination work and more significantly, the contribution from government assistance programs in 2020 that totaled $35.6 million in this segment versus about $10 million this year.
The midpoint of our guidance assumes growth of approximately 120%.
That level of adjusted EBITDA would also put us approximately 45% above what this segment achieved in 2019, which demonstrates how well we are managing the business, the impact of IMO 2020 on our markets and the super-sized spread caused by supply driven price increases in base oil and blended products.
As a final SKSS reference point, in 2020, this segment received government assistance of $3.7 million.
We also had about $3 million in government assistance in 2020 in corporate versus less than $0.5 million this year.
For the full year 2021, our adjusted EBITDA guidance now assumes receiving a total of $11 million to $12 million in government program assistance primarily from Canada.
Based on our current EBITDA guidance and working capital assumptions, we now expect 2021 adjusted free cash flow in the range of $280 million to $315 million or a midpoint of $300 million.
