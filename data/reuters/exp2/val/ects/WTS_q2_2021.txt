We continue to make progress toward our goal of 25% smart and connected product sales by 2023.
In 2020, we reduced our water usage by 33% and our greenhouse gas emissions by 13%.
This past year, sales of our condensing boilers and water heaters reduced more than 110,000 metric tons of CO2 for our customers, more than four times what Watts generated as a company.
To date, we have positively impacted over 30,000 people in eight different countries, providing safe drinking water and education on the importance of proper hand sanitization.
Sales of $467 million increased 38% on a reported basis and 32% organically, driven primarily by the global economic recovery.
Adjusted operating profit increased 85% and adjusted operating margins expanded 380 basis points to 14.9%.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 100% as compared to last year from the better operating result as well as favorable below the line items and a foreign exchange benefit.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.1% compared to 26.4% in the prior year period.
Total pre-tax exit costs approximate $26 million, which includes approximately $2 million in non-cash charges.
For GAAP purposes, we booked approximately $18 million of those costs in the second quarter and expect approximately $2 million in additional restructuring charges in the second half of 2021.
Full year pre-tax run rate savings should approximate $5 million, which should be fully realized in 2023.
We expect about $0.5 million in savings this year, largely in the fourth quarter.
Free cash flow was $65 million through June 30, up 160% from the same period last year.
Our goal remains to achieve free cash flow conversion at 100% or more of net income for the year.
Gross leverage was 0.7 times and net leverage was negative 0.2 times.
Our net debt to capitalization ratio at quarter end was also negative at 4.5%.
During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 31,000 shares of our common stock and at investment of $4 million, primarily to offset dilution.
The region experienced organic sales growth of between 28% and 51% during the second quarter as compared to last year, amid a strong economic recovery.
Sales also benefited from favorable foreign exchange in Europe and APMEA by 14% and 10%, respectively.
Acquisitions benefited APMEA sales by 14%.
Americas adjusted operating profit increased 54% and adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points to 17.7%, driven by volume, price, cost actions and productivity, which is partially offset by incremental investments, inflation and the return of expenses related to business normalization.
Europe's adjusted operating margin increased 700 basis points to 17.1%.
APMEA's adjusted operating margin increased 460 basis points to 17.9%, driven by trade volume, a 61% increase in affiliate volume, productivity and cost actions, which more than offset inflation.
We are estimating consolidated organic sales growth for the third quarter to be eight percent to 12% over the third quarter of 2020.
Acquired sales should approximate $2 million.
We anticipate that our adjusted operating margin could range from 13.7% to 14.5% in the third quarter, driven by volume and price, partially offset by investments of $6 million and incremental cost of $7 million related to the return of discretionary spend.
Corporate costs should approximate $13 million in the third quarter.
Interest expense should be in line with Q2 at about $1.5 million.
The adjusted effective tax rate should approximate 27%.
From an organic perspective, we expect Americas sales growth to be in the range of nine percent to 13% for 2021.
Sales should increase by about $5 million for the full year from acquisitions.
For Europe, we're forecasting organic sales to increase between 10% and 14%.
In APMEA, we now expect organic sales to grow from 23% to 27% for the year.
Sales also increased by approximately $6 million from the AVG acquisition in the first half of 2021.
Consolidated organic sales growth for the full year is expected to range from 10% to 14%.
This is approximately 7.5% higher at the midpoint from our previous outlook and is primarily driven by better global end market expectations and our third price increase in the Americas.
We anticipate adjusted operating margin will be up by 100 to 150 basis points year-over-year, driven by the incremental volume drop-through, price, restructuring savings of approximately $12 million, partially offset by $32 million of incremental investments and expenses related to business normalization and general inflation.
And now regarding other key inputs, we expect corporate costs will approximate $48 million for the year.
Interest expense should be roughly $7 million for the year.
Our estimated adjusted effective tax rate for 2021 should approximate 27.5%.
Capital spending is expected to be in the $35 million range.
Depreciation and amortization should approximate $46 million for the year.
We expect to continue to drive free cash flow conversion equal to a greater than 100% of net income.
We are now assuming a 1.21 average Euro U.S. dollar FX rate for the full year versus the average rate of EUR1.14 in 2020.
Please recall that for every $0.01 movement up or down in the euro-dollar exchange rate, our European annual sales are impacted by approximately $4 million and our annual earnings per share is impacted by $0.01.
We expect our share count to approximate 34 million for the year.
