A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K.
Recurring revenues rose 16% and adjusted earnings per share rose 9%.
The biggest driver of our 7% organic growth across all three of our businesses was the onboarding of closed sales as we continue to convert our $385 million backlog into recurring revenue.
Finally, our strong start to the year puts us in a very good position to reaffirm our full year guidance, including 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth and 11% to 15% adjusted earnings per share growth.
It also keeps us on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives.
ICS recurring revenues rose 11% to $410 million.
The other key driver continued to be position growth, which reached 39% for equity proxies in a small quarter, and 9% for funds and ETFs.
It's a great example of how our expertise in managing preferences and voting and our 24/7 SaaS platform is helping our fund industry clients.
We continue to make progress in growing our franchise with revenues rising 34% to $209 million driven primarily by the integration of Itiviti, which is going well.
In wealth and investment management, revenues rose 6% to $131 million.
Our strong first quarter results reflect the underlying growth trends powering our business and the execution of the clear growth plan we laid out at our Investor Day 11 months ago.
We're pursuing a $52 billion market opportunity that's continuing to evolve.
But what we are seeing now is a continuation of a 50-year trend driven by the ongoing combination of new technology and reduced trading costs.
More recently, modern user interface, 0 commission trading and the pandemic have accelerated this long-term trend.
Our 24/7 SaaS technology platform plays a critical role in powering that system of corporate governance.
Our platform is constantly monitoring and validating positions across more than 100 million retail and 270,000 institutional accounts.
As a result, we've built a 24/7 proxy and fund information infrastructure, which delivers highly accurate voting for thousands of annual meetings and whose efficiency saves funds and corporate issuers hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
You can see that strong performance in the financial summary on slide seven, which shows that recurring revenues grew 16% to $751 million.
Adjusted operating income rose 17% to $177 million, with AOI margins flat to last year at 14.8%, reflecting our continued ability to find efficiencies and gain operating leverage through our scale, allowing us to invest in our technology and digital platforms.
As a result, adjusted earnings per share rose 9% to $1.07.
Recurring revenues grew from $650 million in Q1 '21 to $751 million in Q1 '22, an increase of 16%.
Organic recurring revenue grew at 7% and came in at the high end of our 5% to 7% three-year objectives, reflecting the continued momentum from our sales and revenue backlog and increased investor participation.
ICS recurring revenue grew by 11%, all organic, to $410 million, propelled by a combination of new sales and strong volumes.
Regulatory revenues rose 23% to $165 million, powered by higher mutual funded ETF communications, strong equity position growth in the U.S. and closed sales revenue.
Data-driven fund solutions revenue grew 5% to $83 million, boosted by an increase in revenue from assets under administration and revenue from new sales of our data and analytics products.
Finally, customer communications revenues rose 2% driven by new sales and growth in digital.
In turning to GTO, recurring revenues grew 21% to $341 million and 2% organic.
Wealth and investment management revenues rose 6%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading.
Capital Markets revenues increased 34% as we benefited from a full quarter of Itiviti revenue.
The biggest driver of our internal growth was mutual fund and ETF record growth, which rose 9% driven by healthy markets and strong inflows.
Equity record growth was 39% in a seasonally small quarter.
So keep in mind that the first quarter historically represents approximately 5% of full year equity communications with more than 80% coming in the fiscal third and fourth quarters while mutual funded ETF communications are more balanced through the year.
On the bottom of the slide, we saw a modest 2% increase in our trading volumes as higher fixed income volumes were offset by lower equity volumes.
Turning to slide 11, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth.
Recurring revenues rose 16%, powered by 7% organic growth and nine points from acquisitions.
Our recurring revenue retention rate remained unchanged at 98% and internal growth contributed another two points as growth in ICS outpaced the decline in GTO.
Itiviti was the biggest driver of our acquisition growth, contributing $54 million of growth with a much smaller contribution from the tuck-in acquisitions we made late in Q4 and in early Q1.
Total revenue growth was 17% as strong recurring revenue growth was accompanied by four points of growth from higher distribution revenue and three points from event-driven revenues.
Low to no margin distribution revenues grew 11% year-over-year, primarily resulting from the higher customer communications mailings.
Event-driven revenues rose to $76 million in the quarter, driven by higher mutual fund proxies.
Despite this timing benefit and given the strong start to the year, we now expect event-driven revenues for the full year to be modestly ahead of our $220 million seven-year average.
For modeling purposes, we're expecting Q2 to Q4 to be in line with our $55 million seven-year quarterly average.
So let's now move to margins on slide 13.
Adjusted operating income margin was flat at 14.8% in the first quarter.
We continue to expect AOI margin of approximately 19% for the full year as we benefit from the higher-margin Itiviti revenues and continued margin expansion in our organic business, offsetting the greater-than-expected higher growth and low margin distribution revenues.
Moving on to close sales on slide 14.
Closed sales of $30 million were essentially flat year-over-year.
And closed sales were balanced across both our ICS and GTO segments, and we continue to see over 2/3 of our sales in smaller core deals, those under $2 million in annualized value.
We remain on track to deliver $240 million to $280 million in closed sales for the full year.
And finally, cash flow and capital allocation on slide 15.
Broadridge's cash flow generation is typically negative in the fiscal first quarter and strengthens throughout the year, and Q1 '22 was no exception with negative free cash flow of $151 million.
We invested $82 million in our platforms during the first quarter.
During the quarter, we had a modest minority investment and invested $13 million in a pair of tuck-in acquisitions within our capital markets business.
We continue to expect 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth, adjusted operating income margin of approximately 19% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to 15%.
I'll note that over the last five years, the first half has typically represented less than 30% of our full year adjusted earnings per share, and I expect that trend to hold in fiscal year '22.
Finally, as I noted earlier, we expect closed sales in the range of $240 million to $280 million.
Broadridge delivered strong first quarter results with 16% recurring revenue growth driven by new sales, strong underlying volume trends and the acquisition of ltiviti.
We are reaffirming our guidance for a strong fiscal year 2022, and we are investing in our business as we pursue our $52 billion addressable market.
