We delivered 6% revenue growth outside the US, including mid teens growth in emerging markets.
And our emerging market growth is up 9% versus pre-pandemic levels in Q2 fiscal '20.
And when you look at our sequential revenue performance, our 2% decline was slightly better than most of our large cap medtech competitors.
In diabetes, while we lost share again this quarter, we remain pleased with the momentum we're building outside the US, not only with the 780G insulin pumps, but also with the positive customers' feedback we've heard on our extended infusion set and fingerstick free Guardian Sensor 4.
We've launched over 180 products in the US, Western Europe, Japan, and China in the last 12 months.
We're heavily investing in this pipeline with a targeted R&D spend of over $2.7 billion this fiscal year, which is an increase of over 10%, the largest dollar increase in our history.
And as a result sales this fiscal year are likely to come in below our $50 million to $100 million target.
In diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump combined with our Guardian 4 sensor continue to be under active review with the FDA.
The user experience has also improved markedly, and these outstanding results were achieved with our 780G paired with our Guardian 3 sensor.
So we expect the experience will be even stronger with Guardian 4.
It's easier to apply and half the size of Guardian 4, and we expect to submit it to FDA later this fiscal year.
With its best-in-class battery, constant current, and full-body MRI compatibility at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla, we expect this device will extend our category leadership in this space.
Our second quarter organic revenue increased 2%, reflecting the market impact of COVID and health system staffing shortages on procedure volumes, primarily in the United States.
In fact, our adjusted earnings per share increased 29% significant growth, reflecting the pandemic impact last year, and our adjusted earnings per share was $0.03 better than consensus with $0.02 from stronger operating profit and a penny [Phonetic] from a lower than expected tax rate.
Looking down our P&L, we had strong year-over-year improvement in our margins, 360 basis points on gross margin, as we continue to recover from the significant impacts from COVID last year and 470 basis points on operating margin, given savings from our simplification program tied to our operating model.
Our year-to-date free cash flow was $2.4 billion, up 58% from last year, and we continue to target a full year conversion of 80% or greater.
We're also returning capital back to our shareholders with a commitment to return greater than 50% of our free cash flow, primarily through our dividend.
Year-to-date, we paid $1.7 billion in dividends.
As a result of these potential headwinds and given we're only mid way through our fiscal year, we believe it is prudent to update our fiscal '22 organic revenue growth guidance to 7% to 8% from the prior 9%.
If recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a positive impact on full year revenue of $0 million to $50 million, down from the prior $100 million to $200 million I gave last quarter.
By segment, we expect Neurosciences to now grow 9% to 10%, Cardiovascular and Medical Surgical to grow 7.5% to 8.5%, and Diabetes to be down low single digits, all on an organic basis.
And on the bottom line, we reiterate our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance range of $5.65 to $5.75.
This continues to include a currency benefit of $0.05 to $0.10 at recent rates.
For the third quarter, we're expecting organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% year-over-year.
At recent rates, we're expecting a currency headwind on third quarter revenue of $80 million to $120 million.
By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5% to 6%, Neuroscience 4% to 5%, Medical Surgical 2% to 3%, and Diabetes to be down mid single digits, all on an organic basis.
We expect earnings per share between $1.37 and $1.39, with a currency tailwind of $0.02 to $0.04 at recent rates.
I know we have more to prove, but I'm confident that our organization, our talented and dedicated 90,000 plus global employees are up for the challenge.
