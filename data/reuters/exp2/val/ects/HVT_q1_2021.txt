Even though our undelivered backlog is up almost 4 times last year, our current incoming orders are continuing at the elevated pace we have seen since January.
Even with all these headwinds, we were able to receive approximately 10% more product in Q1 versus Q4.
Staffing remains our #1 concern in this area.
In the first quarter of 2021, delivered sales were $236.5 million, a 31.8% increase over the prior year quarter.
Total written sales for the first quarter of 2020 were up 54.5% over the prior year period.
Comparable store sales were up 11.5% over the prior year period.
Our gross profit margin increased 160 basis points from 55.5% to 57.1% due to better merchandising, price and mix and less promotional activity during the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12.2 million or 12.5% to $109.8 million, primarily due to increased sales activity.
However, as a percentage of sales, these costs declined 800 basis points to 46.4% from 54.4%.
Income before income tax has increased $23.1 million to $25.4 million.
Our tax expense was $6 million in the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.5%.
Net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $19.4 million or $1.04 per diluted share on our common stock compared to net income of $1.8 million or $0.09 per share in the comparable quarter of last year.
Now looking at our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter, our inventories were $103.6 million, which was up $13.7 million over the December 31, 2020 balance and down $6.9 million versus the first quarter of last year's balance.
At the end of the first quarter, our customer deposits were $104.7 million, which was up $18.5 million from the December 31, 2020 balance, and up $78.6 million versus the Q1 2020 balance.
We ended the quarter with $210 million of cash and cash equivalents, and we have no funded debt on our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter of 2021.
capex for the quarter was $4.7 million.
And we also paid $4 million of dividends during the first quarter of 2021.
We currently have $16.8 million remaining under authorization for this program.
We expect our gross margins for 2021 to be between 56.5% and 57%.
Our fixed and discretionary type SG&A expenses for 2021 are expected to be in the $265 million to $268 million range, a slight increase over our previous 2021 estimate due to rising benefit costs.
The variable type costs within SG&A for 2020 are expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 17.8%, a slight increase over the most recent quarter based on potential increases in selling and delivery costs.
Our planned capex for 2021 remains at $23 million, anticipated new replacement stores remodels and expansions account for $12.9 million, investments in our distribution network are expected to be $6.4 million, and investments in our information technology are expected to be approximately $3.7 million.
Our anticipated effective tax rate in 2021 is expected to be 24%.
