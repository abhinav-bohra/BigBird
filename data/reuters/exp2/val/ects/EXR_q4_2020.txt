In my 35 years in real estate, I can't remember another year with as many positive and negative twist and turns in such a short period of time as we saw in 2020.
We ended the year with same-store occupancy of 94.8%, an all-time year-end high for Extra Space.
Our elevated occupancy has given us significant pricing power, which we have experienced since August and a return to positive same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2.3%, a 380 basis point acceleration from the third quarter.
We also had excellent expense control with a 0.6% decrease in same-store expenses, resulting in 3.4% NOI growth in the quarter.
Our return to positive NOI gains coupled with strong external investment activity yielded core FFO growth of 16.5% in the quarter.
Despite the challenges of the year, the fourth quarter was full of accomplishments, including completion of two preferred equity investments totaling $350 million, $147 million in acquisitions, $168 million in bridge loan closings, the addition of 44 stores to our management platform, and receipt of NAREIT's Leader in the Light award, recognizing Extra Space for its sustainability efforts.
We have already added 51 third-party management stores in 2021 and our acquisition, management and bridge loan pipelines are robust.
We lowered expenses in all controllable expense categories in the quarter and despite property tax increases of 6.4%, we still delivered a reduction in same-store expenses overall.
This resulted in same-store NOI growth of 3.4%.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.48, a year-over-year increase of 16.5% and well above consensus estimates.
Our new same-store pool includes a total of 860 stores, which is essentially flat with last year.
We anticipate the changes in the same-store pool will benefit our 2021 same-store revenue growth by approximately 20 basis points.
Same-store revenue is expected to increase 4.25% to 5.5%, driven by higher occupancy in the first half of the year and elevated rates in new and existing -- to new and existing customers.
Same-store expense growth is expected to be 3.5% to 4.5%, primarily driven by higher property tax expense.
Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth range of 4.25% to 6.25%.
Our guidance assumes $350 million in Extra Space investment, approximately $180 million of which is closed or under contract.
We also expect to close approximately $400 million of bridge loans and plan to retain 20% to 25% of those balances or approximately $100 million in 2021.
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be between $5.85 and $6.05 per share.
We anticipate $0.16 of dilution from value-add acquisitions or C of O stores, down $0.04 from 2020.
