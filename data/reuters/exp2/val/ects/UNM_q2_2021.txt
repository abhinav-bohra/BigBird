Net income for the second quarter of 2021 included the after-tax cost related to the early retirement of debt of $53.2 million or $0.26 per diluted common share.
The after-tax amortization of the cost of reinsurance of $15.5 million or $0.08 per diluted common share, an after-tax impairment loss on the right-of-use asset related to one of our operating leases for office space we are no longer using to support our general operations of $11 million or $0.05 per diluted common share, a net after-tax realized investment gain on the company's investment portfolio of $600,000 or $0.01 per diluted common share and a net tax expense related to a U.K. tax rate increase of $24.2 million or $0.12 per diluted common share.
Net income in the second quarter of 2020 included an after-tax impairment loss on the right-of-use asset of $10 million or $0.05 per diluted common share and a net after-tax realized investment gain of $25.4 million or $0.12 per diluted common share.
So excluding these items, after-tax adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2021 was $286.2 million or $1.39 per diluted common share compared to $250.1 million or $1.23 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter.
We showed a 13% increase year-over-year in after-tax adjusted operating income to $1.39 per share.
Given our strong second quarter results, we are raising our outlook for full year 2021 growth in after-tax adjusted operating income per share to a decline of approximately 1% to 3% compared to our previous outlook of a decline of 5% to 6%.
And Colonial Life showed very strong results this quarter with over a 50% increase from the year ago quarter, a good indicator of consumer interest in the basic financial protection products we offer.
It remained very healthy as well, with holding company cash of $1.7 billion and weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional U.S. insurance companies at 375%.
Additionally, this quarter, we successfully completed a 30-year debt issue and redeemed a shorter high-coupon maturity, enabling us to further extend our debt stack while reducing the overall coupon.
Leverage remains approximately 28% -- 26% and provides further capital flexibility for us.
We also expect to be consistent in returning capital to shareholders through dividends, which will increase by 5.3% with the dividend to be paid this month.
These and many other efforts help place Unum among the Points of Light, Civic 50, and in Forbes Best Employers for Diversity, Best Employers for Women and Best Employers for New Graduates.
We are proud of how it has helped us endure through the challenges of the past 1.5 years and how the engagement of our team will propel us going forward.
I'll start with the Unum US segment, which reported adjusted operating income for the second quarter of $179.3 million compared to $115.7 million in the first quarter.
Within the Unum US segment, the group disability line reported operating income of $59.9 million in the second quarter compared to $64.1 million in the first quarter.
Premium income was generally consistent between the two quarters and on a year-over-year basis increased 1.1%.
The group disability benefit ratio for the second quarter was 74.7%, which is consistent with the first quarter benefit ratio of 74.8%.
Adjusted operating income for Unum US group life and AD&D showed a sharp improvement in the second quarter to income of $5.2 million compared to a loss of $58.3 million in the first quarter.
This improvement is consistent with our expectations and largely explained by the significant reduction in COVID-related mortality in the U.S., which declined from approximately 200,000 nationwide observed deaths in the first quarter to approximately 52,000 in the second quarter.
We estimate that we incurred approximately 800 excess claims from COVID in the second quarter compared to an estimate of 2,050 COVID claims in the first quarter.
Our average size of claim increased in the second quarter by approximately 10% as we experienced a mix shift to a more younger, working-age policyholders who typically have higher benefit amounts.
Now looking ahead to the third quarter, our current expectation for nationwide COVID related mortality of approximately 40,000 compared to approximately 52,000 experienced in the second quarter.
Assuming the shift in the mix continues to more younger, working-age individuals with a continued higher average benefit amount, we would estimate third quarter group life operating income to show a modest improvement over second quarter results to approximately $15 million.
We saw an improved quarter with adjusted operating income of $114.2 million in the second quarter compared to $109.9 million in the first quarter.
Though the benefit ratio did increase to 48.4% in the second quarter from 42.4% in the first quarter, it continues to perform quite well compared to our pre-pandemic experience as new claim incidence trends and recovery levels remain favorable.
And then finally, utilization in the dental and vision line was higher this quarter, as was the average cost per procedure, pushing the benefit ratio to 77.1% in the second quarter compared to 73.2% in the first quarter.
Sales for Unum US in total declined 3.1% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to a decline of 10.3% in the first quarter.
For the employee benefit lines, which include LTD, STD, group life, AD&D and stop loss, total sales declined by 3.1% this quarter.
For this quarter, total sales declined 3.1% year-over-year compared to the 22.3% decline in the first quarter.
Our recently issued individual disability sales increased 4.9%, and dental and vision sales increased 2.4% year-over-year.
Voluntary benefit sales were down 7% in the quarter, which is consistent with our view that these sales will take longer to recover.
Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $24.8 million compared to $26.4 million in the first quarter and $15.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.
The primary driver of these results is in our Unum UK business, which generated adjusted operating income of GBP16.8 million in the second quarter compared to GBP18.6 million in the first quarter and GBP10.1 million in the second quarter of 2020.
The reported benefit ratio in Unum UK, which showed an increase to 82.5% in the second quarter from 75.3% in the first quarter was impacted by the increase in inflation in the U.K. in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
Looking at the growth on a year-over-year basis and in local currency to neutralize the benefit we saw from the higher exchange rate, Unum UK generated growth of 3% with strong persistency and the ongoing successful placement of significant rate increases on our in-force block.
And Unum Poland generated growth of 12.4%, a continuation of the low double-digit growth this business has been producing.
Next, we are very pleased with the results generated by Colonial Life, with adjusted operating income of $95.8 million in the second quarter compared to $73.3 million in the first quarter.
The benefit ratio improved to 51.7% in the second quarter from 55.4% in the first quarter as experience in the life insurance block improved with the overall decline in COVID-related mortality.
Looking out to the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted operating income to settle back to the low to mid-$80 million range as some of this favorable experience moderates.
We're very excited with the rebound in sales activity we experienced in Colonial Life this quarter, increasing 53.7% on a year-over-year basis.
As expected, premium income declined 4.3% on a year-over-year basis and will likely continue with negative comparisons for the next couple of quarters until sales volumes have sufficiently recovered.
Persistency for Colonial Life continues to show an encouraging trend at 78.3% for the first half of 2021, almost one point higher than a year ago.
Then in the Closed Block segment, adjusted operating income was $111.2 million in the second quarter compared to $97 million in the first quarter, both very strong quarters relative to our historical levels of income for this segment.
Looking within the Closed Block, the LTC block produced a slightly lower interest adjusted loss ratio of 74.6% in the second quarter compared to 77.7% in the first quarter, both results quite favorable to our long-term expected range of 85% to 90%.
Over the past four quarters, the benefit ratio for LTC was 70% excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2020 reserve assumption update.
We continue to see higher mortality experience in the claim a block in the second quarter and estimate that counts were approximately 5% higher than expected.
For the Closed Disability Block, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 69.6% in the second quarter and 68.9% in the first quarter.
We estimate the quarterly operating income for this segment will over time run within the range of $45 million to $55 million, assuming more normal trends for investment income and claim results.
The adjusted operating loss in the Corporate segment was $48.5 million in the second quarter compared to $38.9 million in the first quarter.
We anticipate the quarterly losses in the Corporate segment will moderate in the second half of the year to the low to mid-$40 million range.
We had approximately $10 million higher investment income from bond calls this quarter relative to our historical quarterly averages.
Second, as I mentioned previously, we continue to see strong performance in the valuation mark on our alternative investment assets, which totaled $51.9 million in the second quarter following a positive mark of $35.9 million reported in the first quarter.
Both quarters are well above the expected quarterly positive marks on the portfolio of $12 million to $14 million.
The risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies improved to approximately 375%, and holding company cash was $1.7 billion as of the end of the second quarter, which are both well above our targeted levels.
During the second quarter, we successfully completed a debt offering issuing $600 million of a 30-year senior note with a coupon of 5 1/8.
This was the lowest coupon on a 30-year debt issue in our history.
The proceeds from the issue were used to redeem the $500 million of 4.5% issue that would have matured in 2025.
With the issuance and the redemption completed in the second quarter, our leverage ratio currently is 26.2%, providing additional financial flexibility.
At our outlook meeting this past December, we indicated that our capital plan for 2021 -- in our capital plan for 2021, we assumed a negative impact of approximately $225 million from the adoption of the factor changes.
We now estimate the impact to our capital position to be less than $70 million rather than the $225 million we had previously projected, a very good outcome for us, which provides upside to our capital expectations for year-end 2021.
Previously, we expected a modest decline of 5% to 6% for full year 2021 after-tax adjusted operating income per share relative to the 2020 level of $4.93 per diluted common share.
Given the strong second quarter results and our updated view on COVID trends, we are revising our outlook upward and now look for 2021 after-tax adjusted operating earnings per share to decline by a range of approximately 1% to 3% relative to 2020.
