So our sales mix for REPREVE has maintained an upward trend and has moved now to a record level of 37% in Q2.
It was 35% in the last quarter and in the high 20s a year ago.
And in the last six months, we shipped 45 million hangtags and that compares to 33 million a year ago during that same period.
We believe that many of our customers are now taking action on sustainability commitments that they've made for 2025.
These environmental goals are things that have to be accomplished for our customers, and the date is getting closer, 2025, closer than we really think.
On slide 3, we provided an overview of the quarter.
Our Q2 revenues were up 15% from Q1 with meaningful improvement across all segments and geographies.
Key drivers to the 670 basis point increase in gross margin year over year are results of continued focus on cost, outperformance by the Brazilian segments, and the expansion of our REPREVE and other innovative products, all as more volume -- as more normal volumes occur.
Now, despite a challenging environment, our team's dedication and hard work contributed to Unifi achieving its best quarterly profit since June 2016 and the best second quarter profitability in 10 years.
The pre-fiber sales now represent a record 37% of consolidated net sales compared to 35% in the previous quarter.
Additional details about REPREVE fiber sales are shown on slide 4.
And Hugo Boss has launched athletic inspired footwear with a 100% REPREVE upper.
Let's start with the sales comparison on slide 7.
Polyester segment volumes were just 1.1% lower than the prior year, and raw material costs drove pricing down but were partially offset by a richer sales mix to generate a 7.3% decrease in net sales.
For the Asia segment, lower volumes negatively impacted net sales by 8.1%, while the lower raw material cost impacted pricing, generating an overall 6.7% decrease in net sales after considering some favorable foreign currency translation due to the strengthening of the renminbi against the US dollar.
Brazil segment outperformed 21.7% growth from higher volumes, while strong pricing levels helped to nearly offset the significant unfavourability of foreign currency translation due to the weakening of the real against the US dollar.
Lastly, the Nylon segment showed signs of stability, with revenues just 6.3% below the prior year following sales mix changes.
Moving on to the gross profit overview on slide 8, every segment exhibited an increase.
The Polyester segment benefited from a more favorable raw material and pricing environment along with a richer sales mix and manufacturing efficiencies, achieving a gross margin of 14.2%.
The Asia segment benefited from raw material sourcing improvements and a rich sales mix, driving gross margin to 14.6%.
For Unifi overall, gross profit was $25.9 million and a 670 basis point increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales.
Slides 9 and 10 show the sales and gross profit comparisons for the first half of fiscal 2021 compared to the first half of fiscal 2020.
Moving on to the balance sheet on slide 11, further improvement in our debt and liquidity positions is demonstrated by maintaining diligence around working capital components and generating cash flows.
With great progress on our net debt metric, we continue to have zero borrowings on our ABL revolver which had an availability of $56 million as of December 27, 2020.
We have had the opportunity closing 2 acquisitions and we'll continue to allocate capital for new texturing technology in Amer -- in the Americas.
Lastly, given our momentum from the second quarter, our annual capex spend remains consistent with our expectation from the first quarter and should fall in the range of $22 to $24 million, excluding amounts related to the acquisitions.
