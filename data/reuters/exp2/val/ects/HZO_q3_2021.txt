These risks include, but are not limited to, the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions and the level of consumer spending, the company's ability to capitalize on opportunities or grow its market share and numerous other factors identified in our Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The record sales and earnings growth we delivered was driven by solid 6% same-store sales growth, which is on top of a robust 37% same-store sales growth a year ago.
From a nine month perspective, same-store sales growth was up 21% on top of a 22% a year ago.
We built on our prior quarter's profitability and increased our operating margin to over 12%.
The gross margin strength we produced in the first half of the year accelerated in the June quarter to 30.7%.
In the quarter, gross margin expansion and good expense control led to outstanding operating leverage of over 20% and record earnings per share of $2.59.
For the quarter, revenue grew 34% to over $666 million due largely to same-store sales growth of 6%, which was on top of 37% a year ago, plus the strong results from the acquisitions we have completed, namely SkipperBud's, Northrop & Johnson and Cruisers Yachts.
Our gross profit dollars increased over $81 million, while our gross margin rose 590 basis points to 30.7%.
Our operating leverage in the quarter was over 20%, which drove very strong earnings growth, setting another quarterly record with pre-tax earnings of over $80 million.
Our record June quarter saw both net income and earnings per share rise more than 60%, generating $2.59 in earnings per share versus $1.58 a year ago.
Our revenue exceeds $1.6 billion, driven by a 21% increase in comparable store sales.
Gross margins exceed 30%.
Our operating leverage is around 20%.
Our earnings per share is at $5.33 and our EBITDA is over $180 million, a very impressive nine months.
We continue to build cash with over $200 million at quarter end.
Our inventory at quarter end was $209 million.
Customer deposits almost tripled to over $86 million due to the demand we are seeing setting a new record.
Our current ratio stands at 2.20, and our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is below one.
Our tangible net worth is $386 million.
Given the strength of earnings in the June quarter and the demand-driven visibility, we are raising our estimates for earnings per share guidance to the range of $6.40 to $6.55.
In summary, we do expect our pre-tax earnings to rise in the fourth quarter, which gets dampened a bit by a higher tax rate of around 25% this year as well as higher outstanding shares which results in the earnings per share guidance range.
Our updated 2021 guidance implies an EBITDA level well in excess of $200 million.
