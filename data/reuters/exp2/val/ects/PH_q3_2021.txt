Starting with safety, as we always do, we had a 33% reduction in record incidents.
Sales grew about 1%.
The organic decline was minus 1%, but in particular, if you take out aerospace and look at the industrial only, industrial segment grew organically almost 4%, so that was significant.
We had 5 all-time quarterly records.
EBITDA margin was very strong at 21.6% as reported, 21.8% adjusted a huge increase versus prior 250 basis points, year-to-date cash flow was an all-time record of $1.9 billion and 18 -- a little over 18% of sales.
If you go to the very last row of this page, you see segment operating margin on an adjusted basis, 21.4% and again, a significant improvement versus prior, plus 240 basis points.
The earnings per share over this time period is more than doubled from $7 to our guidance of $14.80, so approaching $15 and was propelled that over that time period as an EBITDA margin that's grown 600 basis points.
Then our performance, which really sits with the strategy of the company, Win Strategy 2.0, at the kind of the beginning of this journey and then The Win Strategy 3.0 most recently in FY 2020.
On the right-hand side is really the internal things we've been doing, Win Strategy 3.0, in particular, but that last slide that I just went through, spoke to all those internal actions because that's what's been propelling us.
And it's one of the key reasons why our LORD business has grown so nicely even despite the pandemic we grew 11% organically in Q3 from LORD.
I'll just orientate everyone to slide 11, and I'll do a quick review of the financial results for the quarter.
Sales for the quarter were $3.746 billion.
That is an increase of 1.2% versus prior year.
Industrial segment organic growth was 3.7%.
Obviously, that was offset by the Aerospace Systems segment, their organic decline was 19.7%.
So all in, that drove total organic sales to minus 1.0.
Currency was a favorable impact this quarter of 2.2%.
Moving to segment operating margins, you saw the number, 21.4%, that's an improvement of 240 basis points from prior year.
It's also an improvement of 130 basis points sequentially, strong margin performance there.
Adjusted EBITDA margins did expand 250 basis points from prior year, finished the quarter at 21.8%.
And net income is $540 million, which is a 14.4% ROS.
That's increased by 22% from prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share is $4.11 that is $0.72 or 21% increase compared to prior year's results of $3.39.
If you slide to slide 12, this is really a bridge of that $0.72 increase in adjusted earnings per share versus prior year.
Adjusted segment operating income did increase by $98 million or 14% versus prior year, that equates to $0.58 of earnings per share and really is the primary driver of the increase in our adjusted earnings per share number.
Interest expense was favorable to prior by $0.12 as we posted yet another quarter of sizable repayment of our serviceable debt, and that is really benefiting from our strong cash flow generation.
Other expense, income tax and shares netted to a $0.02 favorable impact compared to prior year.
Moving to slide 13.
Discretionary statements came in exactly as we guided, at $25 million for Q3, and now total $215 million year-to-date.
That remains $10 million.
And we continue to forecast the total year to be $225 million in full year savings.
If you move to permanent savings, we realized $65 million in Q3.
Our total year-to-date is $190 million.
The full year forecast, again, here remains, as previously communicated, at $250 million.
One item to note, we did guide that the cost of the FY 2021 restructuring would come in around $60 million.
It's now expected to be $10 million less or $50 million but there is no change to the expected savings that we are forecasting.
Total incremental impact for the year for both permanent and discretionary savings is $260 million.
If you go to slide 14, this is just highlighting some items from our segment performance for the third quarter.
In our diversified North America business, sales were $1.76 billion.
It still is down 1.2% from prior year, but if you look at the adjusted operating margins, we did increase those operating margins by 190 basis points versus prior year and reached 21.9% for the quarter.
If you slide over to order rates, another positive here, they improved significantly from plus one last quarter, and they're now ending the quarter at plus 11.
Looking at the diversified industrial international sales, robust organic growth here of 11.1%.
Total sales came in at $1.39 billion, and another great story here, adjusted operating margins expanded substantially and reached 21.6%, an improvement of 400 basis points versus prior year.
And again, another plus here is order rates accelerated in this segment and are now plus 14% for the quarter.
If you look at aerospace systems, they continue to really perform soundly in the current environment sales were $599 million for the quarter.
Organic sales showed a slight sequential improvement from Q2, but are still down basically 20% from prior year.
What's nice here is operating margins were 19.4%, 30 basis points better than prior year, despite that 20% decline in volume.
And if you look at our fiscal year, that performance of 19.4% is the highest they've done all year, so we're really proud about that.
This quarter, they're 18% decremental margins.
Order rates appeared to have bottomed and finished at minus 19% for this quarter.
And just a reminder, that is on a rolling 12-month basis.
That diversified industrial segment, organic growth of 3.7% as a positive.
Total segment margins improved 240 basis points from prior year and at record levels.
Orders have turned positive and are plus 6% and our teams really continue to leverage the Win Strategy to drive significant improvements in our business and increased productivity and generate strong cash flow.
So with that, I'll ask you to go to slide 15.
Year-to-date cash flow from operations is now $1.9 billion.
That's 18.1% of sales.
That's up 45% from prior year, and it is a year-to-date record.
Moving to free cash flow at 16.8% of sales.
That's an increase of 630 basis points over prior year, and our free cash flow conversion is now 141%, which compares to 1.22% in the prior year, so great cash flow generation there.
Moving to slide 16, I just want to mention some things we've done on our capital deployment.
We did pay down $426 million of debt this quarter.
That brings our total debt reduction to a little over $3.2 billion in the last 17 months since the LORD acquisition closed.
This reduced our gross debt-to-EBITDA to 2.4%, it was 3.8% in the prior year, and net debt-to-EBITDA is now 2.2%, and that's down from 3.5% in the prior year.
Last week, you saw our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of $0.15 or 17%.
This raises our quarterly dividend from $0.88 to $1.03 per share and extends our record of increasing the annual dividends paid per share to 65 consecutive years.
Have positioned us to increase our full year outlook for sales to a year-over-year increase of 4.5% at the midpoint and the breakdown of that sales change is this.
Acquisitions will add 3%, and the full year currency impact is expected to be 1.5%.
We've calculated the impact of currency to spot rates as of the quarter ended March 31 and we held those rates constant to estimate the Q4 21 impact.
Our guidance for the full year is raised to 20.8% and that would equate to an increase of 190 basis points versus prior year.
Corporate G&A, interest and other is expected to be $381 million on an as-reported basis and $479 million on an adjusted basis.
The main difference between those two numbers is that $101 million pre-tax or $76 million after-tax gain on real estate that we recognized and adjusted in the other income line in Q2.
We're now expecting the full year tax rate to be 22.5% and moving to earnings per share on a full year basis.
Our as-reported earnings per share guidance range has increased from $12.96 to $13.26, that's $13.11 at the midpoint.
And on an adjusted basis, we're increasing the range from $14.65 to $14.95, and that's $14.80 at the midpoint.
For Q4, adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $4.18 per share, that excludes $0.54 or $93 million of acquisition-related amortization expense, the finishing of our business realignment expenses and integration cost to achieve.
If you look at slide 18, this is just a bridge of our increase -- our adjust earnings per share guidance, these results that we just reviewed you can see the outperformance that we had in Q3.
That increases our previous guide by $0.57.
The order strength that we just reviewed and really the exceptional operation and execution by our teams have allowed us to increase Q4 guide by an additional $0.33, and that is exclusively based on increased segment operating income.
This raises our full year earnings per share guide by about 6.5% from prior guide.
And our dividend increase, which I would just highlight the first time, we've ever been over at $1.03 on a quarterly dividend, which we're very proud of.
So the Win Strategy 3.0 and our purpose statement is well positioned, in addition to those inflection points for a very strong future.
