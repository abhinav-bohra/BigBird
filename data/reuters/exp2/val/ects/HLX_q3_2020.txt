Usual high standards of performance in Brazil, both vessels performed very well achieving high utilization of 99%.
Robotics chartered vessel fleet was very active, working between ROV support, trenching, renewable works globally, completing 450 days of utilization across seven vessels, with five of the vessels working outside of the oil and gas markets on renewables projects.
Slide 12 provides a more detailed review of the operations for our Well Intervention business in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Q5000 had 100% utilization, continuing to work for BP, undertaking ultra-deepwater production enhancement operations, performing extremely well with zero commercial downtime with continued integration of our Helix Schlumberger Alliance teams.
The Q4000 performed well with 85% utilization due to a small gap in schedule alignment between projects, completing work in ultra-deepwater for three clients.

We're assuming the full quarter to Siem Helix 1 and 2 in Brazil.
Providing more color by segment and region on Slide 22.
In Brazil, the Siem Helix 1 and 2 are on hire for the balance of 2020.
Continuing on Slide 24, moving into our capex.
Forecast remains at $38 million for the year, comprised primarily of the recertification cost of our vessels, the majority of which has already been spent in Q1.

Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $259 million.
We anticipate tax refunds in the amount of approximately $19 million in the near term as a result of the tax changes from the CARES Act.
I'll skip Slide 26 and leave it for your reference.
Fortunately, we took action earlier in this year to manage our balance sheet to minimize this as one of our challenges and extend the runway of debt maturities out to 2026.
Our intention will be to pay down another $101 million of our debt by the end of 2021 and continue to operate with low leverage going forward.
We also generated almost 10% of our 2020 revenues from the renewables market.
