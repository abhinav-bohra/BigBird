Our second quarter results, revenue up 8%, EBITDA up 2% and earnings per share up 5% year-over-year were slightly ahead of our guidance.
New products introduced in the last 12 months contributed $30 million in sales growth in the quarter and our plant health products, including biologicals, posted Q2 sales growth in the high teens.
We reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects an 8% increase on a reported basis and a 4% increase organically.
Asia and Latin America posted the largest growth of 20% and 15%, respectively.
Our fungicides grew over 50% in the quarter, driven by the Xyway launch in the U.S., and fungicides represented 8% of total sales in Q2 versus 5% of our sales in the prior year period.
Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.
EBITDA margins were 28%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of continued and accelerating cost headwinds.
Adjusted earnings were $1.81 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 5% versus Q2 2020 and also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Despite the unfavorable weather conditions in several regions, Q2 revenue increased by 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 4% volume increase and a 4% tailwind from foreign currencies.
Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan.
In Latin America, sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically.
EMEA sales increased 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% organically as FX was a significant tailwind in the period.
In North America, sales decreased 7% year-over-year and 8% organically.
Excluding revenue from our global diamide partnerships, our U.S. and Canada crop business grew greater than 20%, driven by an approximate $25 million contribution from two new products, Xyway fungicide and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops.
EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% year-over-year due to the volume contribution of $42 million, largely offset by a $35 million cost headwind.
FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.54 to $6.94 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint.
This is down $0.31 at the midpoint versus our prior forecast.
Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020.
EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
This is a $50 million reduction at the midpoint compared to our prior forecast due to continued acceleration costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics.
And we already have received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our full year forecast in Brazil.
Guidance for Q3 implies year-over-year sales growth of 8% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 7% organically.
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint versus Q3 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 7% year-over-year.
Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 20% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated.
We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 35% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 46% year-over-year.
Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX.
We have raised our forecast for 2021 revenue contribution from products launched in the last 12 months to $130 million from $100 million before.
Our EBITDA bridge shows an increase of about $50 million in the expected impact from costs versus our May forecast.
But this year-over-year increase will be closer to $20 million rather than the $30 million to $40 million we had previously indicated as we limit overall cost increases.
On the revenue line for the third quarter, we are expecting a 6% contribution from volume, 1% contribution from price and 1% benefit from FX.
In Brazil, this includes cotton, as growers have indicated a 15% increase in hectares for the upcoming season.
FX was a stronger-than-expected tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter at 4% versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against all major currencies relevant to FMC.
Interest expense for the quarter was $32.6 million, down $8.1 million from the prior year period driven by the benefit of lower LIBOR rates and lower foreign debt balances.
With continued low interest rates, we now expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year.
Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for the full year tax rate.
Gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, up roughly $200 million from the prior quarter.
Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.2 times at the end of the second quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $204 million, essentially flat to the prior year period.
With the reduction in our outlook for full year EBITDA, we are similarly adjusting downward our expectations for free cash flow to a range of $480 million to $570 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the fourth quarter.
We returned $87 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $25 million of share repurchases, buying back 212,000 shares in the quarter at an average price of $118.10 per share.
Year-to-date, we've returned $224 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.
For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million, and now expect to repurchase a total of $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares this year, with the outlook for repurchases down slightly, reflecting the lower EBITDA guidance.
Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr have grown to be almost 40% of FMC sales today.
Turning to slide 11 and some basic data on the insecticides market, which has grown by 83% from 2007 to 2019 and is approximately $17 billion in value today.
Following the broad crop protection market drop in 2015, insecticides have grown 2% per year.
We expect this to accelerate in the next decade to about 3.3% compound annual growth rate, as higher-value technologies take more share from older insecticides that are being phased out by regulators.
We believe by 2030, the insecticide market will expand by about $7 billion versus 2019 to $24 billion in total.
Moving to slide 12.
FMC diamides Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr make up well over 80% of the entire diamides class, which includes a few other smaller active ingredients.
Our diamides have grown to be about 10% to 11% of the total insecticide market, and the total diamides class has gained 2% share from 2017 to 2019 to reach 13% of the total insecticide market.
Turning to slide 13.
We show the geographic breakdown of our $1.8 billion in diamide sales in 2020.
Asia makes up nearly 40% of our diamides business today with North America a little over 1/4 of the sales and EMEA and Latin America between 15% and 20% each.
It should be no surprise that fruit and vegetables and rice make up about 50% of our current revenues.
This is why the diamides are so strong in Asia, since that market is about 30% rice and 30% fruit and vegetables.
Turning to slide 14 and our diamides commercial strategy, which we've discussed many times over the past two years.
We also have 50 local agreements in various countries, and we have another 15 potential agreements currently under discussion.
The $1.8 billion diamide revenue in 2020 was roughly 60% through our own commercial activities, which we label as FMC branded on these charts and 40% through our global and local partners.
The success of this model is shown by the fact that the company EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points from 2018 to 2020, even as these partners were growing significantly, confirming this strategy is not margin dilutive.
The other aspect to having sales to partners represent $700 million of our annual revenue can add more volatility in timing of demand.
Moving to slide 15.
We will continue to introduce other new mixtures and innovative formulations in all regions with 11 more launches expected by 2026.
Moving to slide 16, where we provide an update on our registrations and label extension strategy for our FMC-branded diamides.
Today, we have approximately 2,700 approved uses across all products based on Rynaxypyr, and 1,100 across all products based on Cyazypyr.
We currently have 600 regulatory submissions under review and another 230 that we plan to submit to regulators from 2021 to 2025.
We anticipate nearly 600 of these will achieve regulatory approval in the next five years.
Moving to slide 17 and the diamide patent state.
Rynaxypyr is covered by 21 patent families with a total of 639 granted and pending patents.
Together with Cyazypyr active related patents, we have over 30 patent families and close to 1,000 granted and pending patents filed in 76 countries worldwide.
slides 18 and 19 show the patent time lines for the top five markets.
Taking into account our patents and regulatory requirements, we do not expect to see sales by a legitimate generic competitor that uses the approved manufacturing process, which would rely on our Rynaxypyr product data before 2026 in Europe, Brazil, India or in China, and 2027 for the U.S. Using that same approach for Cyazypyr on slide 19, we do not expect to see sales by legitimate generic competitors until 2026 for Brazil, China and India, 2027 for Europe, and 2028 for the U.S.
Moving to slide 20.
