Moving to Slide 7.
IDEX committed $6 million to boost sponsored activities across the company.
Turning now to our commercial results on Slide 8.
Broad rebound in order rates we discussed in the third quarter continued as our fourth-quarter organic orders were up 7% compared to the prior year.
FMT organic orders for the fourth quarter were up 3%, driven by project orders in our water businesses, continued strength in agriculture, and recovery in industrial day rate businesses.
HST organic orders were up 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our Sealing Solutions businesses.
Finally, Fire & Safety/Diversified organic orders were up 15% in the quarter.
A year ago, as we entered 2020, we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2% to 5% world looked like for IDEX.
Turning to Slide 9.
We were able to drive approximately $30 million of revenue in 2020 and expect to generate about the same amount in 2021 related to these initiatives.
So relative to our $25 million to $100 million of opportunities we highlighted, we'll achieve about $60 million.
I'll start with our consolidated financial results on Slide 11.
Q4 orders of $679 million were up 10% overall and up 7% organically.
For the year, orders were down 3% overall and down 4% organically, with strong organic order recovery in the fourth quarter partially offsetting the 18% organic order decline we saw in the second quarter at the height of the pandemic.
Fourth-quarter sales of $615 million were up 2% overall, but down 1% organically.
Our industrial and energy markets led the decline but did have positive organic growth of around 60% of our reporting units, led by strong performance in our ceilings, MPT, and dispensing businesses.
Full-year sales of $2.4 billion were down 6% overall and down 9% organically, driven by the impact of COVID, industrial market softness, and challenges in oil and gas.
Q4 gross margins contracted 20 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a decline in volume and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by price capture.
For the full year, gross margins contracted 140 basis points.
Excluding the impact of the FMD inventory step-up, adjusted gross margins contracted 130 basis points to 43.9%, driven by volume declines in sales mix, offset by our continued ability to capture price and drive operational productivity.
Fourth-quarter operating margin was 22.6%, up 50 basis points compared to prior year.
Full-year operating margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points compared to the prior year.
Adjusted operating margin was 23.4% for the fourth quarter, up 10 basis points compared to prior year and 22.8% for the year, down 140 basis points compared to 2019.
Our Q4 effective tax rate was 22.2%, which was higher than the prior-year ETR of 20.6% due to the revaluation of foreign deferred income tax balances driven by changes in foreign tax rates.
Fourth-quarter adjusted net income was $105 million, resulting in an earnings per share of $1.37, up $0.04 or 3% over prior-year adjusted earnings per share.
Full-year adjusted net income was $397 million, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $5.19, down $0.61 or 11% compared to prior year.
Finally, free cash flow for the quarter was $149 million, up 9% compared to prior year and was 142% of adjusted net income.
For the year, free cash flow was $518 million, a record for IDEX, up 9% versus last year and 131% of adjusted net income, driven by strong working capital performance.
Moving on to Slide 12.
Adjusted operating income declined $66 million for the year.
With organic sales down around $247 million, we would have expected a negative impact in operating income of $148 million at roughly 60% contribution margin rate.
The $148 million was offset by $58 million of executed operational actions, $23 million from the impact of restructuring actions combined with $35 million of discretionary cost control items, and $10 million of price, net productivity, and negative business mix.
Finally, we had $7 million of reduced variable compensation for the year.
This yielded a better-than-expected flow-through of 34%.
Again, organic flow-through is based on taking reported sales and op income, less the impact of FX and acquisitions, which was roughly $77 million on the top line and $7 million of profit.
I'm on Slide 13.
Based on current order rates and expected market recoveries, we see an accelerating 2021 and expect organic revenue for the year to be up 6% to 8%.
This translates to an earnings per share impact of roughly $0.75 to $0.95, depending on our top-line results.
We expect our productivity initiatives to more than offset inflation, providing $0.04 of benefits.
The structural cost actions we have taken are expected to provide $0.12 of earnings per share benefit in the year.
These discretionary add-backs and strategic investments will provide approximately $0.19 to $0.26 of pressure in our 2021 guidance.
Next, we anticipate $0.08 to $0.11 headwind from variable compensation as we reset our incentive comp for the year.
Finally, FMD has one-quarter of inorganic results, which we expect to provide $3 million of revenue but provide $0.03 of earnings per share pressure.
First, we expect an $0.18 headwind from tax, primarily related to discrete benefits we realized in 2020, associated with equity vesting and option exercising.
Second, we expect a 2% tailwind from FX, providing $0.13 of earnings per share benefit.
So in summary, we are projecting organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year, and earnings per share expectations are in the range of $5.65 to $5.95, a 9% to 15% increase over 2020.
Moving to Slide 14.
In Q1, we are projecting earnings per share to range from $1.38 to $1.42 with organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% and operating margins of approximately 23.5%.
The Q1 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%.
We expect a 3% top-line benefit from the impact of FX, and corporate costs in the first quarter are expected to be around $18 million.
Again, we're projecting full-year earnings per share in the range of $5.65 to $5.95 with full-year organic revenue to be up 6% to 8%, with operating margins between 23.5% to 24.5%.
We expect FX to provide a 2% benefit to top-line results.
The full-year effective tax rate is expected to be around 23%.
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be around $55 million.
And free cash flow is expected to be between 115% to 120% of net income.
Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $70 million for the year.
