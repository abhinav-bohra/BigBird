Despite this backdrop, it's the focus of my partners and associates at Stifel that has enabled us to provide the high-quality financial advice that our clients have come to rely on over the past 20-plus years as we've grown into a premier wealth management and middle market investment bank.
This diversification is illustrated by record nine month wealth management revenue despite significant declines in net interest income and deposit sweep fees, both a result of the Fed's implementation of a 0 rate environment.
Likewise, we achieved record nine month institutional revenue as record capital raising and brokerage more than compensated for a 13% decline in advisory revenue.
Over the last 12 months, Wealth Management, under both brokerage and fee models has contributed 46% of net revenue.
Institutional revenues, comprised of equity and fixed income, investment banking and trading, made up 41%, while net interest income comprised the remaining 13%.
The synergy and complementary nature of these businesses is reflected in our return on tangible common equity, which is 23.2% over the past 12 months.
For the third quarter, Stifel's net revenues were $883 million, up 8% from the prior year, representing the fourth highest quarterly revenue in our history.
In fact, for the 12 months ending September 30, 2020, Stifel generated revenue of more than $3.6 billion, up 14% from the 12 months ending September 30, 2019.
Compensation as a percentage of net revenue came in at 59.6%, while operating expenses totaled 21%.
To give a sense of the range of outcomes under our CECL economic models, assuming our base case scenario, we are approximately $40 million over accrued.
On our most severe scenario, we would be approximately $60 million under accrued.
Altogether, earnings per share were $1.59, up 6%.
Pretax margins were 19.4%, annualized return on tangible common equity was 22.2% and tangible book value per share increased 13% over last year to $32.34.
Third quarter wealth management revenue totaled $527 million, up 4% sequentially.
The third quarter benefited from the expected rebound in asset management and service fees, which increased by 16% sequentially as well as improved brokerage revenue both offsetting an 11% decline in NII.
Through the first nine months of the year, our wealth management revenue was up 2% to a record of more than $1.6 billion.
Again, these results were achieved despite the fact that our NII and deposit fee income declined approximately $65 million.
Excluding this impact, our year-to-date wealth management revenue increased 18%, driven by strong growth in our brokerage and asset management revenues, both of which reflect strong recruiting end markets.
In the fourth quarter, we expect another strong quarter for our asset management revenue due to the 8% sequential increase in fee-based client assets, which totaled $115 billion at September 30.
I would also note that total client assets reached $326 billion at the end of the quarter and are just $3 billion below the record level set in the fourth quarter of 2019.
To put numbers to this, we recruited 45 financial advisors with total trailing 12-month production of $38 million.
Our recruiting performance this quarter is a continuation of our successful recruiting efforts since the beginning of 2019, as we've added nearly 250 new advisors who had trailing 12-month production of roughly $200 million.
Through nine months, we generated record net revenue of $1.1 billion, which is up 33% from last year.
These results were driven by capital raising and brokerage, both up more than 50% from last year.
For the third quarter, net revenue totaled $363 million, up 25% from last year.
Similar to our year-to-date results, capital raising and brokerage increases of approximately 50% drove the increase in the quarter and more than offset the expected softness in advisory revenue.
In fact, if you annualize our results for the first three months of 2020, our institutional revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of nearly 11% since 2009 despite substantial changes in the operating environment.
Fixed income brokerage revenue was $97 million, up 60% year-on-year and was our third highest quarterly revenue ever, with the top two quarters occurring in the first half of the year.
As such, we are having a record year in fixed income brokerage, as the first three quarters are not only up 70% from 2019, but already surpassed our previous full year record in 2016 by 5%.
Equity brokerage revenue of $54 million was up 32% year-on-year as activity levels slowed from the record levels in the second quarter as market volatility slowed.
Like our fixed income businesses, we are also having a record year in our institutional equity brokerage business, as through the first nine months, revenues are up 23% from our previous nine month high recorded in 2014.
Revenue of $218 million was relatively flat with the prior quarter and up 10% year-on-year, driven by record revenue and capital raising.
Much like my comments about our overall institutional business, our investment banking business has not only been sustainable on an annual basis, but has grown at a compound annual rate of 20% since 2009 and has more than offset industry headwinds in our institutional brokerage business.
Equity underwriting revenue of $85 million was up 41% year-on-year and surpassed our prior record by 20% as IPO activity was up significantly from the prior quarter.
Our fixed income underwriting revenue of $53 million was also a record as our public finance business had a strong quarter and the issuance market continued to improve.
Stifel lead managed 264 negotiated municipal issues and one was again ranked number one nationally in terms of the number of issues managed.
Through the first nine months, we have lead managed 632 municipal issues, which is up 17% compared to the combined volume of Stifel and George K. Baum for the same period in 2019.
For our advisory business, revenue of $81 million decreased by 23% year-on-year as we were negatively impacted by the slowdown in bank M&A following a very strong year in 2019.
While bank M&A activity continues to lag the robust levels we saw in 2019, we are starting to see some green shoots as we recently advised CIT on their announced sale of First Citizens, which will create a bank with $100 billion in assets.
This can be seen in what was our second highest quarterly GAAP earnings per share in our history, which resulted in an ROE of nearly 13%, an ROTCE of more than 20%.
For the quarter, net interest income totaled $101 million, which was down $14 million sequentially.
Our results were impacted by the 0% interest rate environment and elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet.
Our firmwide net interest margin declined to 190 basis points, which was consistent with the bank's net interest margin declining to 237 basis points.
Firmwide, average interest-earning assets were relatively flat due to a modest increase in our loan portfolio, primarily due to mortgage loan originations and an 80% increase in our cash position as a result of the debt and preferred equity issuances earlier this year as well as the elevated cash position held at the bank.
We ended the period with total net loans of $10.9 billion, which was flat sequentially.
Our mortgage portfolio increased by $100 million sequentially as we continue to see demand for residential loans and refinancings from wealth management clients given the decline in interest rates.
Our securities-based loans increased in the quarter by approximately $120 million.
Our commercial portfolio accounts for just less than half of our total loan portfolio and is comprised of C&I loans, which declined by 2% during the quarter.
Our portfolio is well diversified with our highest concentration in any one sector at less than 7%.
We adopted CECL earlier this year, and in the first half of the year, we incurred $35 million of credit loss provisions through the P&L, which doesn't include the $11 million opening adjustment that ran through equity.
As you can see on the slide, while the allowance for credit loss was essentially unchanged, we did see an increase in the allowance and our coverage ratio on our commercial portfolio, which increased to 2.03% as a result of additional management overlays.
Our Tier one leverage ratio increased to 11.3%, primarily on the strength of our earnings and a lack of share repurchases.
Our Tier one risk-based capital ratio was 19.2%, a slight decline from last quarter's 19.3%, as we had elevated risk-weighted asset density in our trading portfolio, given some of the volatility we saw earlier in the year.
This decreased risk-based capital by approximately 90 basis points.
As I mentioned earlier, we will pay off our $300 million, five year senior notes when they mature in December.
Our book value per share increased to $50.95, an increase of $2.11 sequentially and our tangible book value per share increased to $32.34, up from $30.16.
In addition to the Sweep Program, the bank has access to off-balance sheet funding of more than $4 billion.
Within our primary broker-dealer and holding company, we've access to nearly $2 billion of liquidity from cash, credit facilities that are committed and unsecured as well as secured funding sources.
Within our Sweep Program, we saw balances increase by $1.7 billion in the third quarter.
So far in the fourth quarter, client cash has grown another $400 million.
In terms of our outlook for the fourth quarter, we would expect net revenues to be in the range of $870 million to $920 million based on strong growth in fee-based assets and the robust investment banking pipelines that Ron described earlier.
We forecast the bank's net interest margin to come in between 235 and 245 basis points, which is in line with our third quarter guidance.
We expect our firmwide net interest margin in the fourth quarter to come in between 190 and 200 basis points given the impact of the maturity of our five year debt in December.
Given NIM expectations, we expect our NII in the fourth quarter to be between $100 million and $110 million, which is in line with our third quarter guidance.
In the third quarter, our pre-tax margin improved 160 basis points sequentially to 19.4%.
Specifically, the comp-to-revenue ratio of 59.6% was down sequentially as we accrued conservatively in the first half of the year.
As such, we are forecasting a comp ratio of between 57.5% and 59.5% in the fourth quarter.
Non-comp operating expenses, excluding the credit loss provision and expenses related to investment banking transactions totaled approximately $173 million and represented less than 20% of our net revenue.
We estimate that non-comp operating expenses in the fourth quarter will represent between 19% and 21% of net revenue.
In terms of our share count, our average fully diluted share count was up by 2% as a result of the increased share price and some modest issuance related to normal stock compensation practices.
In the fourth quarter, assuming a stable share price and no repurchases, we estimate our average fully diluted share count will be 77.4 million shares.
While the market and the economy remain uncertain given the pandemic and the presidential election, the business we've built over the past 20-plus years will continue to generate strong growth and solid returns over the long term.
