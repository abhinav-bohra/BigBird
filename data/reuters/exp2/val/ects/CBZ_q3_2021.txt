As we presented second quarter earnings earlier this year, we made an adjustment to eliminate the impact of the $30.5 million nonrecurring UPMC settlement that was announced on June 30, plus an adjustment to eliminate the impact of the $6.4 million nonrecurring gain on sale from a divestiture that occurred in the second quarter.
On an adjusted basis, for the nine months, adjusted earnings per share was $1.84 compared with $1.41 a year earlier.
This is up 30.5%.
In the third quarter, earnings per share was $0.41 compared with $0.36 a year ago.
As a result, margin on income before tax declined in the third quarter from 11.4% a year ago to 10.3% this year.

To date this year, we have closed five acquisition transactions that will contribute approximately $72 million of annualized revenue.
Through September 30, we have used $74.8 million for acquisition purposes, including earn-out payments on acquisitions closed in prior years.

Through September 30, we utilized approximately $85 million to repurchase 2.7 million shares.
And since that time, through October 26, we have repurchased an additional 258,000 shares.
As a result of these share repurchases, we expect full year share count within a range of 53.5 million to 54 million shares.
At September 30, debt outstanding on our unsecured $400 million credit line was $190.2 million with $201.6 million of unused capacity.

Our effective tax rate for nine months was approximately 24.5%.
There are a number of unpredictable factors that can impact the tax rate either up or down, but we expect the effective rate for the full year within a range of 24% to 24.5%.
With revenue up 14.5% and adjusted earnings per share up 30.5%, the health of our business is very strong.
As we consider the unique items described above that are projected to impact the balance of the year-over-year comparisons, our expectations for the full year are as follows: Total revenue growth in 2021 is expected within a range of 12% to 15% over 2020.
Adjusted earnings-per-share growth is expected within a range of 20% to 24% over the $1.42 earnings per share recorded in 2020.
We expect a full year weighted average share count within a range of 53.5 million to 54 million shares.
