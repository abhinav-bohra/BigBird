Rate growth is as strong as I've seen during my 31-year tenure in the multifamily industry, and we continue to successfully source rental assistance for many residents in need.
Through our associates' hard work, we have successfully reduced our on-site staff by approximately 40% since 2018 and rationalized the rest of our cost structure.
Platform 1.0 initiatives will continue to yield bottom line benefits through 2022, but we are already looking ahead to a new suite of initiatives that will drive additional revenue growth and margin expansion.
Year-to-date, we have sourced nearly $1.2 billion of equity at an attractive cost and $300 million of property sales at favorable cap rates to accretively acquire nearly $1.5 billion of high-quality multifamily communities in desired markets.
Our actions resulted in UDR being named the Number one ESG performer in 2021 GRESB survey among publicly listed residential companies worldwide with a score of 86.
This insight was recently validated in our biannual associate engagement survey, which was conducted following the implementation of Platform 1.0.
Key components of our 5.3% and 6.3% year-over-year Same-Store revenue and NOI growth included weighted average occupancy of 97.5%, 200 basis points higher than a year ago, Effective Blended Lease Rate Growth of 8.2%, which sequentially accelerated by 730 basis points versus the second quarter.
Year-over-year, other income growth of 5.1%.
Traffic that averaged 35% above pre-COVID levels as we continue to open the prospective resident funnel with our Next-Gen Platform and drive additional pricing power and annualized turnover of 54%, which declined by more than 1,100 basis points versus a year ago and was approximately 1,000 basis points below our historical third quarter turnover rate, driven by strong demand.
Sequential Same-Store revenue grew 3.6% in the third quarter.
Regarding key operating metrics for October, occupancy remains elevated and has averaged 97.1% as we continue to see robust demand well into what is historically a seasonally slow period of time.
Our 2.6% anticipated earning 2022 is in line with our highest earning over the past decade and is approximately 150 basis points higher than our average earning between 2016 and 2019.
We are capturing this upside by driving rental rate higher, which has led to Blended Lease Rate Growth of roughly 11.5% in October or 330 basis points above what we achieved in the third quarter.
Roughly 15% of our NOI comes from markets that presently have some form of regulatory restriction on renewal rate increases, but we are utilizing unique UDR attributes such as our various other income initiatives to drive revenue growth.
As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we will anniversary peak COVID concession levels of 3.5 to four weeks on new leases.
As such, and with only nominal concessions today, we are poised to capture rent growth at a 7% to 8% above market growth, which translates into mid- to high-teens expected new lease rate growth during the fourth quarter.
Our Sunbelt communities, which comprise approximately 25% of NOI, have been generating better than 20% year-over-year market rent growth, while harder hit urban centers have risen sharply off the bottom.
It will take time for these market trends to show up in our reported results due to our lease expiration schedule, but 20 of our 21 markets now have rents above pre-COVID levels.
And during the third quarter, we reversed $3 million of our cumulative bad debt reserve.
Year-to-date, we have sourced more than $19 million in assistance for residents in need with nearly $10 million of this coming during the third quarter.
We have another $11 million of applications in process.
Due to our outreach programs, former resident balances totaling over $2.5 million are in the rental assistant application process or have excess funds.
Next, we have fully wrote out Version 1.0 of our Next Generation Operating Platform across all of our markets.
Since the second quarter of 2018, we have permanently reduced headcount at our communities by 40% on average, thereby providing a strong hedge against elevated inflationary pressures.
Realized controllable expense growth has been 360 basis points below the peer average over the last three years, which has driven our controllable operating margin 250 basis points above what a company at our average rent level would expect to produce.
Delivered products and services in the formats, our residents prefer as exhibited by a 24% increase in our resident satisfaction score and an overall 97% usage rate for self-guided prospective resident tours.
Generated the best Same-Store revenue growth in roughly 45% of the markets we share with peers versus a 30% average win rate among the peer group.
And generated more than $15 million of incremental NOI on our legacy communities with another $5 million expected through 2022.
Thus far, we have expanded the weighted average yield on our nearly $1 billion of third-party acquisitions from 2019 by 55 basis points.
For the roughly $2.5 billion of third-party acquisitions we completed between 2019 and 2021, we have, on average, grown revenue by 14% and NOI by 20% compared to the prior owner.
Reduced controllable operating expenses per unit by 7% and expanded our controllable operating margin by 400 basis points.
In our view, Platform 1.0 has been a game changer, but we are not done.
While too early to give specifics, we believe these initiatives could potentially dwarf the economic benefits of Platform 1.0.
Our third quarter FFO as adjusted per share of $0.51 and achieved the high end of our previously provided guidance range and was supported by strong Same-Store revenue growth and accretive transactions.
For the fourth quarter, our FFOA per share guidance range is $0.52 to $0.54.
The $0.02 per share or 4% sequential increase at the midpoint for continued positive sequential Same-Store NOI growth and accretion from recent capital allocation activities.
We now anticipate full year FFOA per share of $2 to $2.02 with the midpoint representing a $0.02 or 1% increase from prior guidance.
This increase is driven by a $0.02 benefit from a 75 basis point midpoint improvement in Same-Store NOI growth, a $0.5 benefit from accretive transaction activity offset by $0.5 from increased G&A expense.
For Same-Store guidance, we are now forecasting full year 2021 revenue growth of positive 1% to 1.5% with concessions on a cash basis and negative 1% to negative 0.5%, with concessions on a straight-line basis.
Additional guidance details, including sources and uses expectations, are available on Attachments 14 and 15-D of our supplement.
Our gross 2021 acquisition activity is on pace to total approximately $1.5 billion.
During the quarter and subsequent to quarter end, we accretively acquired seven communities for $900 million and sold one community for $126 million.
Some highlights include: first, during the quarter, we settled approximately 11.4 million shares of common stock under previously announced forward equity sales agreements for a combined $500 million of proceeds which we used to equitize completed transactions.
During and subsequent to quarter end, we entered into forward sale agreements for approximately six million shares of common stock for a combined $320 million of future expected proceeds.
Second, we have only $290 million of consolidated debt or less than 1.5% of enterprise value scheduled to mature through 2025 after excluding amounts on our credit facilities and our commercial paper program.
Our proactive approach to managing our balance sheet has resulted in the best 3-year liquidity outlook in the sector and the lowest weighted average interest rate among the multifamily peer group at 2.7%.
Last, during the quarter, we expanded our credit facility capacity to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion, extended its maturity to January 2026 and increased our commercial paper capacity to $700 million from $500 million.
We also extended the maturities of our $350 million term loan and $75 million working capital facility to January 2027 and January 2024, respectively.
As of September 30, our financial leverage was 25% on enterprise value, inclusive of joint ventures, and our liquidity totaled $1.6 billion, as measured by our cash and net credit facility capacity and including the future expected proceeds from the settlement of our forward equity sale agreements.
