Based on our strong first-half results and ongoing conversations with our customers, we are raising our expectations for the year again and now expect approximately 20% sales growth in our North American fenestration segment, approximately 15% sales growth in our North American cabinet components segment, and approximately 40% sales growth in our European fenestration segment.
Net sales of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion.
Adjusted EBITDA of $125 million to $130 million.
Depreciation of approximately $33 million.
Amortization of approximately $14 million.
SG&A of approximately $115 million.
Interest expense of $2.5 million to $3 million.
Tax rate of approximately 27%.
Capex of $30 million to $35 million.
And free cash flow of $60 million to $65 million.
If you adjust for the expected increase in SG&A, the implied incremental adjusted EBITDA margin is in the low 20% range.
From a cadence perspective for Q3 and on a consolidated basis, we expect net sales to be up by 28% to 30% year over year.
We do expect net sales growth of approximately 10% year over year during the quarter on a consolidated basis.

On a year-to-date basis, operational improvements and volume-related leverage gains have helped offset the timing-related material impacts and resulted in margin expansion of approximately 150 basis points.
Unallocated corporate and other costs were $4.3 million for the quarter, which is $7.2 million higher than the prior year.
Despite inflationary headwinds, we continue to make progress in these areas and this work has strengthened our balance sheet by enabling us to further pay down debt during the quarter, while still repurchasing approximately $2 million in treasury stock.
With these points in mind, on a consolidated basis, we're confident in our ability to deliver revenue growth in the low-20% range this year, while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margin in the low-12% range despite the increasing inflationary pressures.
