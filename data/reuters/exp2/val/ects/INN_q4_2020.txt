As you are all well aware, 2020 was a historically challenging year for our industry as air travel and business and consumer spending deteriorated significantly, primarily as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, which led to a previously unimaginable over 35% decline in industrywide demand.
RevPAR in our pro forma portfolio declined 63.7% in the fourth quarter, essentially on top of a 63.5% decline in the third quarter as the seasonally slower fourth quarter provided slightly easier year-over-year comparisons that mostly offset marginally lower nominal RevPAR.
Our fourth quarter RevPAR decline compared favorably to the RevPAR declines in top 25 and urban markets of 69% and 76% respectively.
For the second consecutive quarter, our portfolio was profitable at the hotel-level and has been profitable on a cumulative basis since May with an average RevPAR of approximately $40, demonstrating the clear benefits of our efficient and flexible operating model.
Our asset and revenue management teams continue to do a remarkable job operating in a low demand environment as our pro forma portfolio achieved a RevPAR index of nearly 138% during the fourth quarter, which represents a market share gain of nearly 22 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
For the full year, our pro forma portfolio finished with the RevPAR index of 134%, which represents an increase of more than 19 percentage points.
Weekend occupancy was 52% during the fourth quarter, which led to RevPAR levels that were 40% higher than weekdays.
Hotels in markets we classify as drive-to, outperformed hotels in fly to markets by nearly 20 percentage points.
Our extended stay hotels posted fourth quarter occupancy of approximately 60%, achieving a 74% RevPAR premium compared to our non-extended stay hotels.
Our 42 non-urban hotels achieved nearly 55% occupancy during the fourth quarter and ran over 60% on weekends.
And our hotels in resort suburban airport and other locations also performed relatively better during the fourth quarter, each posting occupancies of more than 50%.
For the full year 2020, we reported pro forma RevPAR of $52, which represents a decline of 59.2% year-over-year.
This decline also compares favorably to the declines in top 25 and urban markets of 62% and 68% respectively.
By the time lodging demand troughed in April of last year, hotel-level full time equivalents had been reduced by approximately 85%, leading to a 47% reduction in hotel operating expenses in 2020, which were down over 4% on a per occupied room basis despite historically low occupancy levels.
On an aggregate basis, hotel-level operating and fixed expenses were approximately $140 million lower in 2020 than in 2019.
And our hotel EBITDA retention was an impressive 46% from April through year end despite over a 70% decline in RevPAR during the same period.
Despite recent improvements and some stabilization in occupancy, we continue to operate our hotels utilizing a very lean staffing model, as we had on average less than 14 FTEs per hotel during the fourth quarter, approximately 40% of normalized pre-pandemic staffing levels.
In an effort to preserve liquidity, we delayed most non-essential capital expenditures and suspended common dividend distributions in 2020, which combined, preserved approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter and $120 million on an annualized basis.
To date, we have more than $400 million of liquidity and a manageable monthly cash burn rate that averaged just under $7 million per month in the fourth quarter.
This represented a slight increase from the third quarter as a result of the lower nominal RevPAR levels, but represents nearly 40% improvement from the second quarter and the continuation of a generally declining trend.
For example, approximately 55% of our transient occupied room nights in the fourth quarter were booked within 72 hours of stay and nearly 70% booked in the week for the week.
Our performance over President's Day weekend was particularly encouraging as we had our best weekend and best single night since the start of the pandemic on that Saturday with the portfoliowide RevPAR of nearly $90.
In January, we successfully completed a convertible notes offering that generated gross proceeds of $287.5 million at a 1.5% coupon that mature in February 2026.
The notes have a base conversion premium of 37.5%.
we entered into capped call transactions that increased the effective conversion premium to 75% or $15.26 per share.
Net proceeds from the transaction totaled $258.7 million, which were used to reduce our outstanding revolver balance to zero and partially pay down our $225 million term loan maturing in November of 2022 to a balance of $127 million.
In addition to extending our covenant waiver period, our amendment increases liquidity by providing access to the full availability of our $400 million revolver, which currently has an outstanding balance of $10 million.
We also have the ability to utilize $150 million of current liquidity to fund new investments and have an unlimited ability to fund acquisitions with equity issuances.
We currently have more than $400 million of total liquidity, which includes approximately $23.5 million of unrestricted cash on hand.
Today, our weighted average interest rate is approximately 3.2%.
One housekeeping note on the timing of the filing of our 10-K.
However, given the unusually severe winter weather we experienced in Texas last week, which led to widespread power outages, we are delaying the filing until this Friday, February the 26.
