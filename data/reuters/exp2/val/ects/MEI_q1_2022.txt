Let's begin with the business highlights on Slide 4.
Our sales for the quarter were $288 million.
Excluding favorable currency translation, our organic growth was up 45% from the prior year.
Focusing on EV, last quarter, we reported that sales into EV applications were 13% of consolidated sales.
This quarter, EV sales were 16% of consolidated sales and we continue to expect that number to be in the mid-teens for fiscal 2022.
We have ample liquidity, which also allows us to execute our stock buyback program, under which we purchased $7.6 million of shares in the quarter, and to pay our dividend, which rose from $0.11 to $0.14 per share in the quarter.
Moving to Slide 5.
The awards identified here represent some of the key businesses -- business wins in the quarter and represent over $30 million in annual business at full production.
Turning to Slide 6.
First quarter sales were $287.8 million in fiscal year '22 compared to $190.9 million in fiscal year '21, an increase of $96.9 million or 50.8%.
The year-over-year quarterly comparisons include a favorable foreign currency impact on sales of $10.3 million in the current quarter.
The increase was mainly due to lower sales in the prior year quarter from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to higher sales of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, which amounted to 16% of sales in the first quarter of fiscal year '22, which was in line with our previous communication that electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicle sales would comprise mid teens of our fiscal year '22 consolidated sales.
First quarter net income increased $8.4 million to $29.1 million or $0.76 per share diluted from $20.7 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the same period last year.
Fiscal year '22 first quarter margins were 24.9% as compared to 23.6% in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.
The negative impact of the supply disruption and higher logistics costs, including freight, on the first quarter of fiscal year '22 gross margin was nearly 300 basis points.
First quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 11.4% compared to 13.9% in the fiscal '21 first quarter.
First, income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal year '22 was $5.7 million or 16.4% as compared to a net tax benefit of $5.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.
The effective tax rate was lower in the first quarter of fiscal year '21 due to discrete tax benefits of $7.8 million in the quarter or $0.20 per diluted share.
Without the discrete tax benefits, the effective rate would have been 17.2%.
The year-over-year tax expense increase was $10.8 million.
Second, other income net was lower by $1.6 million, mainly due to lower international government assistance between the comparable quarters.
Fiscal year '22 first quarter EBITDA was $48.5 million versus $29.3 million in the same period last fiscal year.
For fiscal year '22 first quarter free cash flow was a negative $6.2 million as compared to a positive $4.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.
In the first quarter of fiscal year '22, we invested approximately $15.9 million in capex as compared to $11.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '21.
The higher first quarter capex is in line with our expectation that capex in fiscal year '22 would be higher than the investment in the prior year estimated to be in the range of $53 million to $57 million.
In the first quarter of fiscal year '22, we reduced gross debt by $4.7 million.
Since our acquisition of Grakon in September 2018, we reduced gross debt by nearly $123 million.
First, on March 31st, we announced the $100 million share repurchase program, which we executed $7.6 million of repurchases during the first quarter of fiscal year '22.
Since the authorization's approval, we have purchased $15.1 million worth of shares at an average price of $46.45.
In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.11 to $0.14 per quarterly share, an increase of 27%.
We ended the first quarter with $207.9 million in cash.
The revenue range for the full fiscal year '22 is between $1.175 billion to $1.235 billion.
Diluted earnings per share range is between $3.35 to $3.75 per share.
