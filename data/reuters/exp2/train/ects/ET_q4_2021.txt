These statements are based on our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which we expect to be filed this Friday, February 18.
For the full year 2021, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $13 billion, which was a significant increase over 2020 and in line with our expectations.
DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $8.2 billion, which resulted in excess cash flow after distributions of approximately $6.4 billion.
On an incurred basis, we had excess DCF of approximately $5 billion after distributions of $1.8 billion and growth capital of approximately $1.4 billion.
On January 25, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.175 per common unit or $0.70 on an annualized basis, which represents a 15% increase over the previous quarter and represents the first step in our plan to return additional value to unitholders.
At our Nederland terminal, we completed expansions in early 2021 that brought our companywide total NGL export capacity to more than 1.1 million barrels per day which we believe is the largest in the world.
We continue to expect the combined company to generate more than $100 million of annual run rate cost savings synergies, of which we expect to achieve 75 million in 2022.
Construction of the final phase of the Mariner East pipeline is complete and commissioning is in progress which will bring our total NGL capacity on the Mariner East pipeline system to 350,000 to 375,000 barrels per day, including ethane.
For full year 2021, NGL volumes through the Mariner East pipeline system and Marcus Hook terminal are up nearly 10% over 2020.
For the full year 2021, we loaded nearly 26 million barrels of ethane out of the facility.
For 2022, we expect to load a minimum of 40 million barrels of ethane and project this to increase to up to 60 million barrels for 2023.
And in total, our percentage of worldwide NGL exports has doubled over the last two years, capturing nearly 20% of the world market, which was more than any other company or country exported during the fourth quarter of 2021.
At Mont Belvieu, we recently brought online a 3 million-barrel high-rate storage well, which increases our total wells to 24 and our NGL storage capabilities at Mont Belvieu to 53 million barrels.
In early June, we commenced service on the 65,000 barrels per day crude oil pipeline, providing transportation service from our Cushing terminal to our Nederland terminal, which also provides access for Powder River and DJ Basin barrels to our Nederland terminal via an upstream connection with our White Cliffs pipeline.
And as we mentioned on our last call, we are moving forward with phase 2, which will nearly double the pipeline's capacity to 120,000 barrels per day.
Phase 2 is expected to be in service by the end of the first quarter of 2022 and is underpinned by third-party commitments.
This project allows us to move approximately 115,000 Mcf per day of rich gas out of the Midland Basin and to utilize available processing capacity more efficiently, while also providing access to additional takeaway options.
In addition, an expansion is underway, which will bring the top line's total capacity to over 200,000 Mcf per day in the first quarter of 2022.
And due to significantly increased producer demand, we now plan to build a new 200 MMcf per day cryogenic processing plant in the Delaware Basin.
This pipeline project would include the construction of a new approximately 260-mile pipeline from the Midland Basin to our existing 36-inch pipeline Southwest of Fort Worth, parallelly existing right of way.
Turning to the Gulf Run Pipeline, which will be a 42-inch interstate natural gas pipeline with 1.65 Bcf per day of capacity.
Gulf Run is backed by a 20-year commitment from Golden Pass LNG and will provide natural gas transportation between the Haynesville Shale and the Gulf Coast, connecting some of the most prolific natural gas-producing regions in the U.S. with the LNG export market.
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion, compared to $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020.
DCF attributable to the partners, as adjusted, was $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter, compared to $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020.
For the fourth quarter, we saw higher transportation volumes across all of our segments, including record volumes in the NGL and refined products segment as well as a $60 million adjusted EBITDA contribution from the acquisition of Enable for the month of December.
On January 25th, we announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.175 per common unit or $0.70 on an annualized basis.
This distribution represents a 15% increase over the previous quarter and represents the first step in our plan to return additional value to unitholders while maintaining our leverage ratio target of four to four and a half times debt to EBITDA.
Future increases to the distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $0.305 per quarter or $1.22 on an annualized basis while balancing our leverage target, growth opportunities and unit buybacks.
Adjusted EBITDA was $739 million, compared to $703 million for the same period last year.
NGL transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.9 million barrels per day, compared to 1.4 million barrels per day for the same period last year.
With average fractionated volumes of 895,000 barrels per day compared to 825,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2020.
For our crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $533 million, compared to $517 million for the same period last year.
For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $547 million, compared to $390 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
This was primarily due to a $147 million increase related to favorable NGL and natural gas prices.
Gathered gas volumes were 14.8 million MMBtus per day, compared to 12.6 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to higher volumes in the Permian, South Texas, and Northeast regions as well as addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021.
In our interstate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $397 million, compared to $448 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We have seen steady growth recently in the interstate segment with the fourth quarter up more than 10% over the third quarter of 2021 even without the impact of Enable.
For our Intrastate segment, adjusted EBITDA was $274 million, compared to $233 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
With expectations for continued strong performance from our existing business as well as the addition of the Enable assets, we expect our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be $11.8 billion to $12.2 billion.
We expect growth capital expenditures, including expenditures related to the recently acquired Enable assets to be between 1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, balanced primarily across the midstream NGL refined products and interstate segments.
This number includes approximately $200 million of 2021 planned capital that has been deferred into 2022 as well as growth capital related to the recently acquired Enable assets, in particular, Gulf Run pipeline.
As of December 31, 2021, total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was slightly over $2 billion, and our leverage ratio was 3.07% for the credit facility.
During the fourth quarter, we utilized cash from operations to reduce our outstanding debt for approximately $400 million.
And for full year 2021, we reduced our long-term debt by approximately $6.3 billion.
In addition, we have increased our growth capital spend, as I mentioned earlier on the call, with this capital focused on strong returning projects that will be in service in less than 12 months.
