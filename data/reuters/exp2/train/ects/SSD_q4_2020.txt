Our net sales improved 11.6% over 2019 to $1.28 billion, the highest in the company's history, driven by strong sales volume.

Our goal was to achieve a compounded annual growth rate in net sales of approximately 8% from 2016 to 2020.
As of the year end of 2020, we had well exceeded this target, achieving a compounded annual growth rate over 10% relative to our 2016 baseline.
Milestones that helped support this goal included price increase for the majority of our US wood connector products in the third quarter of 2018, the signing of one of our largest US homebuilding companies onto our builder program resulting in 23 of the Top 25 US builders now engaged on our program, strong repair and remodel trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of Lowe's as the home center customer in mid-2020.
We aimed to reduce our total operating expense as a percent of net sales from 31.3% in 2016 to a range of 26% to 27% by the end of 2020.
For the full year of 2020, we recorded operating expenses as a percent of net sales of 25.6%, representing 570 [Phonetic] basis points of improvement compared to 2016.
Our next plan was to improve our operating income margin to a range of 16% to 17% by the end of 2020.
We reported an operating income margin of 19.9% for 2020, a 350 basis point improvement compared to 16.4% in 2016.
By focusing on these higher margin products to increase profitability, we exceeded our goal of improving our global concrete gross margin from 34.7% in 2016 42% in 2020.
As a result, we achieved an operating income margin of 7% excluding our SAP costs of approximately $2.5 million in 2020.
While this is lower than our original target range of 8% to 9%, we are pleased with the results, which reflect approximately 350 basis points of improvement versus the 2016 numbers.
We've completed a three-phase SKU reduction program, eliminating upwards of 12,000 non-moving or slow-moving items and converted our customers over to replacement products.
The final element of our 2020 plan was focused on maximizing shareholder value with the goal of improving our return on invested capital from 10.5% in 2016 to a range of 15% to 16% by the end of 2020.
Through our solid operational execution, combined with the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered our effective income tax rate beginning in 2018, we surpassed this target, ending 2020 with the return on invested capital of 20%.
In 2020, we returned $116.2 million to our stockholders through the payments of $40 million in dividends and $76.2 million in share repurchases.
Since the onset of the 2020 plan, we have returned over 83% of our cash generated by operations to our shareholders, far exceeding our target of 50% I'm extremely proud of all that we've accomplished in these past three years and by executing on the 2020 plan, we achieved solid organic growth, we've rationalized our cost structure to improve companywide profitability and we've improved our working capital management and balance sheet position, in turn creating value for all key Simpson stakeholders.
