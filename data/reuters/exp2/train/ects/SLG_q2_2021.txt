With the year-to-date total return exceeding 30% through yesterday's close, our stock has performed very well as the market is resetting its views of the New York economy after COVID-related restrictions were lifted on May 19th.
Average physical occupancy in SLG's portfolio is approaching 25% as tenants are reopening new doors and more and more workers return to the office.
Within our portfolio, this has led to almost 1 million square feet of new and renewal office leasing at rents that are generally flat with expiring escalated rents and TI packages that are marginally higher than pre-COVID levels.
We are currently tracking about 0.5 percentage point higher in occupancy than originally projected at the beginning of the year.
And with over 600,000 square feet of additional leasing in pipeline, we hope to maintain our performance through year-end.
There are about 6,000 to 7,000 new office jobs being created monthly, which trend is expected to continue and result in reattaining pre-COVID office employment levels by mid 2022.
Wall Street profits, which ended 2020 with a near record $51 billion in profits has already posted $18 billion in profits in just the first quarter.
And the big five banks reported 150% increase in second quarter earnings year-over-year, and last year was a good year for the banks.
It should come as no surprise that New York City personal and corporate income tax collections are at all time record levels of $15 billion and $5 billion respectively.
Moving on, the next time we speak such as making ready for workers returning to the office after Labor Day, completion of demo and all the column reinforcement for the commencement of vertical construction next month at 1 Madison, the commencement of marketing, all of the residential units at 185 Broadway will begin next week, the commencement of full demolition of 760 Madison Avenue, now that we just received our DOB permit to make way for the new Giorgio Armani retail boutique in condominiums.
