The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.
SoCalGas began flowing renewable natural gas at two additional biomethane projects in support of their goal to provide 20% RNG to core customers by 2030 to help the state reach its decarbonization goals.
In Texas, Oncor has provided visibility to their 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan, which has increased to approximately $14 billion over the five-year period.
At Sempra Infrastructure, we completed the exchange offer for IEnova's shares, resulting in a 96.4% ownership interest, and we plan to launch a cash tender offer for the remaining 3.6% interest.
As a result, Oncor is announcing its 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan of approximately $14 billion, nearly a $2 billion increase over the 2021 to 2025 capital plan.
Furthermore, Oncor is increasing its 2021 to 2022 capital plan by approximately $425 million, consistent with what Allen outlined at the Investor Day and is largely incorporated in the new $14 billion five-year capital plan.
A good example of this robust growth can be seen in new relocations, expansions and electric service to Oncor's system, which are on pace to exceed 2020 values by 70% and to exceed 2019 values by 170%.
This compares to second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $2,239,000,000 or $7.61 per share.
On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2021 earnings were $504 million or $1.63 per share.
This compares to our second quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $501 million or $1.71 per share.
On a year-to-date basis, 2021 GAAP earnings were $1,298,000,000 or $4.24 per share.
This compares to year-to-date 2020 GAAP earnings of $2,999,000,000 or $9.91 per share.
Adjusted year-to-date 2021 earnings were $1,404,000,000 or $4.58 per share.
This compares to our year-to-date 2020 adjusted earnings of $1,242,000,000 or $4.20 per share.
The variance in the second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items: $126 million from a CPUC decision that resulted in the release of a regulatory liability at the California utilities in 2020 related to prior year's forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account; and $22 million of lower earnings due to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively.
This was more than offset by: $38 million higher equity earnings from the Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase one achieving full commercial operations in August of 2020; $35 million of lower losses at Parent and Other, primarily due to lower preferred dividends and lower net interest expense; $34 million of higher income tax benefits from forecasted flow-through items at SDG&E and SoCalGas; and $22 million income tax benefit in 2021 from the remeasurement of certain deferred income taxes at Sempra LNG.
