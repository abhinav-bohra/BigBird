All such statements should be evaluated together with the safe harbor disclosures and the risks and other uncertainties that affect our business, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
Q1 revenue increased 5.3% to $698 million.
Segment operating income increased 52.5% to $119 million, and reported earnings per share increased 4.2% to $0.99.
The health of our people has been our top priority from day 1.
Today, we have nearly $1.5 billion of liquidity at our disposal.
This resulted in structural reductions in 2020 of nearly $65 million.
Organic sales in Motion Technologies were up 17% after 10% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The new auto platforms that we won and Friction's ability to deliver for our customers drove 1,500 basis points of outperformance versus global auto production.
And we secured positions on 9 new platforms with EV content during the quarter, 8 of which are in China, the largest automotive market in the world.
This is building on the 42 EV platforms wins in 2020.
Connectors grew sales in all regions, and orders were up 20% organically with strength primarily in the distribution channel.
From a profitability perspective, ITT generated adjusted segment operating income growth of 27% and margin expansion of 300 basis points on 2% organic sales growth.
Incremental margin was above 70% for the quarter.
IP's margin was nearly 16%, driven by net productivity as we continue to drive supply chain improvements and better manufacturing performance.
This follows a 15%-plus margin performance in Q4 of 2020.
As a result of the revenue growth and margin expansion, ITT delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.06, a sequential and year-over-year increase.
Even more telling is the fact that earnings per share was $0.15 above the first quarter of 2019.
Free cash flow was up 70%, representing a margin of nearly 16%.
On capital deployment, we repurchased ITT shares totaling $50 million early in Q1, executing on our repurchase plan and achieving half of our full year plan of $100 million.
On organic sales, we now anticipate growth of 5% to 7%, a 300 basis point increase on both the low and high end of our original guidance.
On adjusted earnings per share, the increased sales volume and the strong productivity expected in 2021, combined with the carryover impact of our 2020 cost actions, will generate earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $4 at the high end, which equates to 19% to 25% growth versus prior year.
This is a $0.30 improvement at the midpoint from our prior guidance and puts ITT on pace to surpass 2019 earnings per share.
From a top line perspective, Motion Technologies delivered a solid performance driven by strong auto growth and continued share gains in our 3 main regions.
Our Friction OE business grew nearly 30% organically with impressive 42% growth in North America.
Our focus on operational excellence produced 280 basis points of net productivity in Q1.
These included $50 million of savings from our 2020 cost actions.
Industrial Process grew margin 450 basis points to 15.8% despite a 12% organic sales decline.
And Motion Technologies expanded margin nearly 300 basis points to 20.6%.
The impact was 100 basis points this quarter, substantially higher than what we were expecting.
This smart growth investment drove roughly 50 basis point impact this quarter.
Our plan for the year still assumes approximately $100 million of capex, an increase of over 50% relative to 2020.
We drove positive organic growth at an incremental margin of over 70%.
We generated nearly 300 basis points of productivity and invested in ITT's future.
We repurchased ITT shares worth $50 million and raised our dividend 30%, the ninth consecutive dividend increase.
Q1 organic revenue growth of 17% was primarily driven by strength in auto.
Our strong momentum from last year carried forward as Q1 grew 5% sequentially over Q4 2020.
Friction OE grew 29% organically, and we outperformed global auto production by 1,500 basis points.
Segment margin expanded 280 basis points versus prior year and 110 basis points versus Q4 2020.
For Industrial Process, revenue was down 12% organically, driven by short-cycle declines, primarily in oil and gas and chemical markets.
However, we continue to see steady sequential progress in short-cycle orders with 9% sequential growth from Q4 and a strong book-to-bill of 1.1.
IP margin expanded 450 basis points to a segment record of 15.8%.
This represents $6 million of operating income growth on $25 million of lower sales.
Our Connector business was up 20% versus prior year and up 3% sequentially, driven by continued North American distribution strength.
And we delivered a much improved 29% decremental margin in Q1.
Partially offsetting the share count benefit was a roughly $0.01 headwind from a higher-than-planned effective tax rate of 22%.
The increase in adjusted segment margin expansion by 40 basis points across our range reflects our expectations for higher volumes and continued productivity generation in addition to the stronger-than-planned margin expansion from Q1.
As you will see on Slide 7, our revised guidance assumes the incremental impact from this global trend will be $0.25 to $0.30 for the remainder of 2021.
Our revised earnings per share guide reflects a $0.30 improvement at the midpoint of our range to $3.90, which would put us $0.09 above 2019.
Our 4-year effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22%.
Our guidance also continues to assume a reduction of approximately 1% in our 4-year weighted average share count.
We are raising our free cash flow guidance by $25 million at the midpoint to reflect the impact of higher operating income, and we now expect free cash flow margin of 11% to 12%.
On Slide 7, let's look at the components of our revised 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance.
Organic sales growth is expected to be above 20%, driven by MT's strong performance and an easy 2020 compare.
From a total ITT perspective, adjusted segment margin should be equal or slightly above second quarter of 2019 of 16.1%, which we believe is a more representative comparison.
