For KAR overall we generated $585 million in revenue an increase of 40% from Q2 of last year.
We generated total gross profit of $252 million which represents 51.7% of revenue excluding purchased vehicles.
We generated $116.5 million of adjusted EBITDA which was a 46% increase compared to Q2 of last year.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $131 million.
Within the ADESA segment we facilitated the sale of 711000 vehicles representing for $11 billion in gross auction proceeds.
53% of our Q2 sales were from off-premise locations.
We sold 119000 vehicles on the TradeRev and BacklotCars platforms on a combined basis.
It represents a growth of 65% compared to Q2 of last year and sequential growth of 19% versus Q1.
We generated $277 in gross profit per vehicle sold in the ADESA segment.
That represented an increase from the $264 in Q1.
SG&A for KAR overall was $140 million for the quarter.
SG&A for the ADESA segment was $131 million which was down $9 million from Q1 resulting in SG&A of $185 per vehicle sold.
So in Q2 of 2019 KAR facilitated a sale of 994000 vehicles.
Over 70% of those approximately 700000 vehicles were sold by commercial sellers.
The remainder which was approximately 275000 vehicles were sold by dealer sellers.
So from that statistic alone we can see that historically commercial sellers have represented the majority of KAR's used vehicle supply over 70%.
This is more so than our industry overall which is more like 50-50.
During Q2 of this year the volume sold on behalf of commercial sellers was approximately 420000 vehicles a decline of over 40% versus Q2 of 2019.
In Q2 of 2021 the volume of vehicles sold by commercial sellers at all U.S. auctions was down by 48% versus Q2 of 2019 in our industry according to Auctionet.
In the face of this supply shortage of new vehicles market values for used off-lease vehicles have increased by as much as 40% versus one year ago.
Based on our internal analysis the average equity in an off-lease vehicle increased to an all-time high of close to $8000 per vehicle in Q2 and that was up from an average of less than zero two years ago.
The positive equity situation for lessees resulted in a reduction of over 50% in off-lease vehicles being returned versus what we would normally expect.
For those vehicles that were returned we saw upstream conversion reach an all-time high of approximately 80% in Q2.
So while we enjoy nearly 80% market share in the upstream off-lease segment in North America a record number of vehicles were kept up by consumers where we received no fees or by the grounding dealers where we generate lower revenue.
In Q2 based on our data repossession volume across our industry continued to be about 35% below what we would consider to be normal levels.
We sold 292000 dealer vehicles in Q2 of this year.
That was an increase of 6% versus the 276000 dealer-owned vehicles that we sold in Q2 of 2019.
If we look at the digital dealer category only Q2 represented our strongest performance yet with 119000 vehicles sold representing year-over-year growth of 65%.
I've been pleased with AFC's performance in the present quarter but also over the past 18 months since the onset of the pandemic.
AFC continues to have healthy margins with gross profit for the quarter right at 80% and with SG&A of under 13% of revenue.
In terms of its key metrics AFC had 356000 loan transactions in the quarter.
Revenue per loan transaction was strong at $193 for the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA of $116.5 million represents approximately 20% of operating revenue.
Gross profit for the quarter was 51.7% of revenue net of purchased vehicles.
The primary drivers of this strong performance gross profit per unit at ADESA $277 up from $224 in the prior year and $264 in the first quarter.
AFC revenue per loan transaction was $193 up from $115 in the prior year and $177 in the first quarter and this more than offset a decline in the number of loan transactions compared to the prior year and the first quarter.
Operating adjusted net income per share of $0.15 was negatively impacted by a reduction in net unrealized gains on publicly traded securities and an increase in our effective tax rate to 44% primarily driven by nondeductible expenses related to the increased contingent consideration recorded for the CarsOnTheWeb acquisition.
We have generated $296 million of cash from operating activities in the first six months of 2021 of which $131 million was generated in the second quarter.
First our total volumes sold at ADESA was up 10% over the prior year.
Given the industry headwinds particularly around the commercial vehicles as Peter mentioned we are pleased with 10% year-over-year growth.
If I include the BacklotCars volume for the second quarter of 2020 in our denominator our growth in volume is 4%.
I think most impressive in our performance is the 65% growth rate in digital dealer-to-dealer for the U.S. and Canada.
Auction fees per vehicle sold of $333 was up 21.5% from the prior year.
Average selling price for all vehicles in the second quarter was $16400 compared to $14800 one year ago.
Average auction fees on off-premise transactions increased from $119 in 2020 to $153 for 2021.
This increase was accomplished even though average selling prices for total off-premise transactions declined slightly as we grew the digital dealer-to-dealer channel 65% while the off-premise commercial volumes declined 15% in the second quarter.
The average auction fees for the digital dealer-to-dealer marketplace our fastest-growing marketplace was $268 per vehicle sold an increase of only $1 from the prior year.
However another key contributor was interest and fee income per loan transaction that increased to $191 per loan transaction from $155 per loan transaction last year.
This demonstrates the impact of having over 50% of the revenue for AFC from fees creating less dependence on interest rates to drive revenue.
As the stock price of CarLotz has declined since March 31 we have reduced the unrealized gain on investments by $11.9 million.
This required adjustment to the carrying value resulted in a reduction of net operating adjusted net income per share of $0.04 net of income taxes.
We also recorded $4.5 million of accrued contingent consideration related to the CarsOnTheWeb transaction as the performance of ADESA Europe formerly CarsOnTheWeb has exceeded the amounts recorded using a Monte Carlo simulation of possible outcomes at the time of purchase.
The earn-out is capped and we are recognizing the increase to the maximum earn-out payment amount ratably over the year so the quarterly expense should not increase from $4.5 million.
We deployed $100 million to purchase KAR stock in the open market at an average purchase price of $17.77 in the second quarter.
Year-to-date we have repurchased $180.8 million of KAR stock in the open market at an average purchase price of $16.66.
We have just under $110 million left on our share repurchase authorization.
Through the first half of 2021 our capital expenditures totaling $50.7 million have been focused primarily on our digital marketplaces.
Although the root cause and duration of the current environment in our industry is much different than 2009 and the period that followed I also see many similarities in the impact on volumes trends in used car pricing and the prospects for recovery following a period where we are at the bottom of the down cycle in our industry.
