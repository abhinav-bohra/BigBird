Our second quarter results were strong on top of our exceptional second quarter performance last year and also reflect our robust growth momentum on a two year basis, as seen on Slide 4.
As seen on Slide 5, we have a broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio with compelling offerings for every retail and customer strategy across all channels.
Turning to Slide 6.
Total second quarter sales grew 11% from the year ago period and constant currency sales grew 8% attributable to substantial growth in our Flavor Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in our Consumer segment, both impacted by the factors I've mentioned a few moments ago.
The considerable shift in sales between segments resulted in an adjusted operating income decline of 1% or 4% in constant currency.
At the bottom line, our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 in the year ago period, driven lower primarily by a higher tax rate.
Year-to-date, we've grown sales and adjusted operating income 16% and 14% year-over-year respectively, both of which include 3% favorable impact from currency, and we've grown adjusted earnings per share 10%.
Starting on Slide 7, with our Consumer segment comparing to the highly elevated demand levels in the second quarter of last year, sales declined by 2% or in constant currency, 5%.
Our Americas constant currency sales declined 7% in the second quarter with incremental sales from our Cholula acquisition contributing 3% growth.
Our total McCormick U.S. branded portfolio consumption, as indicated in our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels, declined 26%, following a 55% consumption increase in the second quarter of 2020.
Through working with our customers on improving shelf conditions, we estimate approximately 90% of suspended products are now back on shelf.
Focusing further on our U.S. branded portfolio, our IRI consumption data, combined with unmeasured channels, indicates consumption of the portfolio grew 18% versus the second quarter of 2019 led by significant growth in spices and seasonings and hot sauces, and also includes triple-digit pure-play growth in e-commerce with McCormick-branded consumption outpacing all major categories.
Turning to Slide 8.
In the second quarter, our sales rose 39% or 34% at constant currency with double-digit growth in all three regions.
Now for a brief update on how we're driving growth with Cholula and FONA, starting with Cholula on Slide 9.
In our Consumer segment, Cholula continues to outpace category growth and gained share, growing consumption 54% since the second quarter of 2019.
We have grown total distribution points 11% and household penetration 5% since the second quarter of 2020.
Since the beginning of the year, we've driven a 63% increase in U.S. national chain restaurant locations, activating a Cholula-branded limited time offer.
Beverages with particular strength in the fast growing performance nutrition category continue to drive significant growth for FONA, 14% on a year-to-date basis.
In fact, we're now projecting the incremental sales contribution of these acquisitions to be at the high end of our 3.5% to 4% guidance range.
As seen on Slides 11 and 12, global demand for flavor remains the foundation for our sales growth.
In our recent consumer survey from May, 68% of U.S. consumer survey state they are cooking more today than pre-pandemic and 78% claims they would maintain or increase their level of cooking at home as things return to normal next week with no meaningful difference between those vaccinated and those not.
They want to cook versus have to cook with the majority of food from restaurants being consumed at home and over 70% of U.S. consumers are adding their own spices, seasonings and condiments to further flavor their takeaway or deliver food, channels have become orders and lunch is the new meal to prepare at home with hybrid workplace models more common post-pandemic, allowing employees to split time between the office and home.
Research indicates, at-home lunch occasions increasing up 30%.
Moving to Slide 13.
With our overarching focus on growth and successful execution of our strategy, we have consistently driven industry-leading revenue growth, resulting in McCormick being named to the latest Fortune 500 list of companies by Fortune Magazine.
In May, we were named The Diversity Inc. Top 50 Company for the fifth consecutive year.
Starting with our top-line growth, as seen on Slide 17, we grew constant currency sales 8% during the second quarter compared to last year with incremental sales from our Cholula and FONA acquisitions contributing 5% across both segments.
Higher volume and mix drove the 3% increase in organic sales with Flavor Solutions growth offsetting a decline in the Consumer segment.
Versus the second quarter of 2019, we grew sales 18% in constant currency.
As such, versus last year, our second quarter Consumer segment sales declined 5% in constant currency, which includes a 2% increase from the Cholula acquisition.
Compared to the second quarter of 2019, Consumer segment sales grew 22% in constant currency.
On Slide 18, Consumer segment sales in the Americas, lapping the demand surge in the year ago period, declined 7% in constant currency, including a 3% increase from the acquisition of Cholula.
Compared to the second quarter of 2019, sales increased 26% in constant currency with significant broad-based growth across the McCormick-branded portfolio.
In the EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales declined 4% from a year ago, also due to lapping the high demand across the region last year.
On a two year basis, sales increased 21% in constant currency versus 2019 pre-pandemic levels with double-digit growth in all markets across the region.
Consumer sales in the Asia Pacific region increased 15% in constant currency due to the recovery of branded foodservice sales as well as recovery from the extended disruption in Wuhan last year with a partial offset from the decline in consumer demand as compared to the elevated levels in the year ago period.
Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment and Slide 21.
We grew second quarter constant currency sales 34%, including a 9% increase from our FONA and Cholula acquisitions.
Compared to the second quarter of 2019, Flavor Solutions segment sales grew 13% in constant currency.
In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 30% year-over-year with FONA and Cholula contributing 13%.
On a two year basis, sales increased 12% in constant currency versus 2019 with higher sales from acquisitions and packaged food and beverage companies, partially offset by the exit of some lower margin business.
In EMEA, constant currency sales grew 65% compared to last year due to increased sales to QSRs and branded foodservice customers as well as continued growth momentum with packaged food and beverage companies.
Constant currency sales increased 16% versus the second quarter of 2019 driven by strong sales growth with packaged food companies and QSR customers.
In the Asia Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales rose 23% in constant currency versus last year led by growth for QSRs in China and Australia, partially due to new products and our customers' limited time offers and promotional activities as well as a recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns in countries outside of China in the year ago period.
Sales grew 15% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2019.
As seen on Slide 25, adjusted operating income, which excludes transaction and integration costs related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions as well as special charges, declined 1% or in constant currency 4% in the second quarter versus the year ago period.
Adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment declined 24% to $177 million or in constant currency 26% driven by -- primarily by lower sales.
In the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income rose 183% to $81 million or 175% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher sales.
Additionally, in the Consumer segment, brand marketing expenses increased 15% in the second quarter of last year.
As seen on Slide 26, our selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points with the increase in brand marketing partially offset by leverage from sales growth.
Adjusted gross profit margin declined 190 basis points and adjusted operating margins declined by 200 basis points.
Importantly, versus the second quarter of 2019, we expanded adjusted gross profit margin 40 basis points and adjusted operating margin 10 basis points even considering incremental COVID-19 costs, cost inflation and higher brand marketing investments.
Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 22.2% compared to 18% in the year ago period.
Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations declined 2% in the second quarter of 2021.
At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 29, second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.74 for the year ago period.
As compared to the second quarter of 2019, our sales growth drove a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share.
On Slide 30, we summarize highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet.
Our cash flow from operations was $229 million through the second quarter of 2021 compared to $355 million in the second quarter of 2020.
We returned $182 million of this cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $113 million for capital expenditures through the second quarter.
Now turning to our 2021 financial outlook on Slides 31 and 32.
We expect there will be an estimated 3 percentage points favorable impact of currency rate on sales, an increase from 2% previously.
And for the adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, we continue to estimate a 2 percentage point favorable impact of currency rates.
At the top-line, due to our strong year-to-date results and robust operating momentum, we are increasing our expected constant currency sales growth to 8% to 10% compared to 6% to 8% previously.
This includes the incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, projected to be at the high end of the 3.5% to 4% range.
We are now projecting our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be 80 to 100 basis points lower than 2020.
Our estimate for COVID-19 cost remains unchanged at $60 million in 2021 versus $50 million in 2020 and weighted through the first half of the year.
Our adjusted operating income growth rate reflects expected strong underlying performance from our base business and acquisitions, projected to be 12% to 14% constant currency growth, partially offset by a 1% reduction from increased COVID-19 costs compared to 2020 and a 3% reduction from the estimated incremental ERP investment.
This results in a total projected adjusted operating income growth rate of 8% to 10% in constant currency.
This projection includes the inflationary pressure I just mentioned as well as our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $110 million.
We also reaffirm our 2021 adjusted effective income tax rate projected to be approximately 23%.
This outlook versus our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be a headwind to our 2021 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 4%.
We are also increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to 6% to 8% growth, which includes a favorable impact from currency.
Our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 is now $3 to $3.05 compared to $2.97 to $3.02 previously.
This compares to $2.83 of adjusted earnings per share in 2020.
This growth reflects strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 12% to 14% in constant currency, partially offset by the impact I just mentioned related to COVID-19 cost, our incremental ERP investment and the tax headwind.
Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways, as seen on Slide 33.
