As anticipated, Q2 adjusted SG&A expenses increased year-over-year and were up $109 million versus 2020.
This deleveraged 228 basis points and was a result of three primary factors.
These increases in Q2 were partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 related expenses to approximately $4 million compared to $15 million in the prior year.
As a result of these factors, our SG&A expenses increased 13.3% to $926.4 million.
As a percent of net sales, our SG&A was 35% compared to 32.7% in the prior year quarter.
Year-to-date, SG&A as a percent of net sales improved 88 basis points compared to the first half of 2020.
Our adjusted operating income increased to $302 million compared to $282 million one year ago.

And in line with our guidance, we estimate we will spend between $300 million and $350 million in 2021.
Due to favorable market conditions along with our improved free cash flow in Q2, we returned nearly $458 million to our shareholders through the repurchase of 2 million shares at an average price of $197.52 and our recently increased quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share.
Based on all these factors, we are increasing our full year 2021 guidance ranges, including net sales in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion, comparable store sales of 6% to 8% and adjusted operating income margin of 9.2% to 9.4%.
As a result, we're lowering our guidance range and now expect to open 80 to 120 new stores this year.
Additionally, given the improvement of our free cash flow and our accelerated share repurchases in the first half of the year, we are also increasing our guidance for free cash flow to a minimum of $700 million and an expected range for share repurchases of $700 million to $900 million.
