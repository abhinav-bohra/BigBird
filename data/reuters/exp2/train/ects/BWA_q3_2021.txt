With just over $3.4 billion in sales, our third quarter revenue decreased by about 7% organically.
Excluding the year-over-year growth in our aftermarket business, our OEM business declined 9% compared to the 22% decline in our market during the quarter as we benefited from new business and favorable mix.
As a result of these awards, along with wins in prior quarters, we are well on our way to achieving the organic electric vehicle 2025 revenue targets underlying our project CHARGING FORWARD.
In fact, we estimate that more than 90% of that target is already booked.
With that in mind, on a full year basis, we now expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to be down 2.5% to flat year-over-year.
Additionally, we announced a new 800-volt silicon carbide inverter award with a German OEM expected to launch in early 2025.
This award expands our existing 400-volt inverter business with this same German customer by now adding 800-volt products.
And as you can see by the chart on the slide, we expect the business to grow rapidly from about 500,000 units in 2021 to 2.5 million units by 2025, representing about 50% CAGR.
We expect this volume to drive total inverter sales of $1.7 billion by 2025 -- in 2025, sorry.
We continue to pursue additional inverter opportunities with production volumes in 2025 and beyond, and would expect to secure more awards in the coming quarters.
And one more thing, with the business we've already won, we believe that we are positioned to be the number one noncaptive inverter producer globally by 2025.
As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q3, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of just under $3.6 billion, which includes a little over $1 billion of revenue from Delphi Technologies.
Next, you can see that foreign currencies increased revenue by about 2%.
Then our organic revenue decline year-over-year was approximately 7% or almost 9%, excluding growth in our aftermarket segment.
That compares to a 22% decrease in weighted average market production, which suggests that our outgrowth in the quarter was more than 13%.
The sum of all these was just over $3.4 billion of revenue in Q3.
Now let's look at our earnings and cash flow performance on slide 10.
Our third quarter adjusted operating income was $311 million compared to pro forma operating income of $396 million last year.
This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 9.1%.
On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of AKASOL, adjusted operating income decreased $79 million on $261 million of lower sales.
That translates to a decremental margin of approximately 30%.
This higher than typical decremental margin was primarily driven by $24 million of higher commodity costs, net of customer recoveries.
Excluding these higher commodity costs, our year-over-year decremental margin was approximately 19%, which we view as a sign that we're effectively managing our operating cost performance in spite of the supply chain disruptions.
We consumed $10 million of free cash flow during the third quarter.
Now let's talk about our full year financial outlook on slide 11.
We now expect our end markets to be down 2.5% to flat for the year.
Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 1,000 basis points.
Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase approximately 8.5% to 11% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue.
Then adding an expected $425 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies and an expected $70 million related to the acquisition of AKASOL, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.4 billion to $14.7 billion.
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 9.6% to 10% compared to a pro forma 2020 margin of 8.3%.
This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi-related cost synergies and purchase price accounting.
From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance continues to include $100 million to $105 million of incremental benefit in 2021, the same as our prior guidance.
Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're now expecting full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.65 to $3.95 per diluted share.
And finally, we expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the range of $600 million to $700 million for the full year.
From a cost perspective, we expect incremental Delphi-related cost synergies in the $40 million to $45 million range, and we also expect incremental restructuring savings of $40 million to $50 million.
These combined savings are expected to largely offset our estimated increase in R&D spending of approximately $100 million.
And finally, we expect to complete the disposition of approximately $1 billion in combustion revenue.
I'm now really excited to share an update of our progress toward our project CHARGING FORWARD targets on slide 13.
Or to put it another way, with this booked business, we're more than 90% of the way toward our $2.5 billion organic revenue target we gave you back in March.
Plus we expect to add to this booked business portfolio over the next quarters by securing additional EV awards with 2025 revenues.
