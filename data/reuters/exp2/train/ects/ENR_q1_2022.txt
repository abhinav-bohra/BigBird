As we look specifically at the results for the quarter, we maintained strength in our top line, delivering revenue of $846 million.
Adjusted gross margin decreased 320 basis points as increased input costs were partially offset by price increases, synergies and the comping of prior year COVID costs.
With our solid topline performance and lower interest expense, we partially offset the gross margin decline and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 in the quarter.
On a two-year stack basis, the global battery category has grown by 9.7% in value and 7.8% in volume.
As anticipated, we saw the category decline in the three months ending November 2021, which was down 3.5% in value and 8.4% in volume.
As we turn to the auto care category in the latest 13 weeks, category value was up 9% versus a year ago and 20.6% on a two-year stack basis.
In battery and lights, strong demand and solid execution resulted in a modest decline in organic sales, while auto care continued its strong performance with organic growth of 1.3%.
Pricing actions globally delivered roughly 2% growth and additional distribution contributed another 1%.
However, adjusted gross margin decreased 320 basis points to 37.5% versus the first quarter of 2021 as pricing, lower COVID-related costs and synergies were offset by more than 700 basis points of margin erosion from inflationary cost pressures.
A&P as a percent of sales was 6.1% versus 5.8% in the prior year as a result of planned increased spend.
Excluding acquisition and integration costs, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was roughly flat at 13.2% but declined $2 million on an absolute basis as lower compensation expense was partially offset by increased travel and higher IT spending related to our digital transformation.
This impact flowed through to the bottom line for each business, resulting in a segment profit decline of $12 million for battery and $18 million in auto care.
Interest expense was $37 million or $10.3 million lower than the prior year, reflecting the benefits of significant refinancing activity of our debt capital structure over the past year.
The total number of shares purchased under this program was nearly 2 million.
Additionally, on January 18, our mandatory convertible preferred stock converted to approximately 4.7 million common shares.
Absent any additional share repurchase, weighted average shares outstanding for the remainder of the year will be approximately 72.
However, due to the lag in timing between the recognition of these higher costs, and the successful rollout of our pricing actions and cost reduction efforts, we expect as much as 50 basis points of additional gross margin pressure to impact us for the full year 2022.
This is incremental to the 150 basis points provided in our outlook in November.
Given the continued strength of demand in our categories and our efforts to offset the majority of these headwinds through pricing and cost reduction initiatives, we are maintaining our fiscal 2022 outlook for roughly flat net sales, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3 to $3.30, and adjusted EBITDA of $560 million to $590 million.
