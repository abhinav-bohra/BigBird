Our dedicated and passionate water professionals met the challenges of 2020 head on to provide a reliable supply of safe drinking water to more than 1.6 million people in our local service communities in California, Connecticut, Texas and Maine.
In my 38 years in this profession, it never mattered more.
For example, in 2020, San Jose Water was responsible for $28.8 million of diverse supplier spend, representing 30.1% of our addressable spend there.
Other highlights of 2020 include investing more than $199 million in our water and wastewater systems across our multistate footprint, achieving world-class customer satisfaction on a composite basis across the Company and another successful year of meeting drinking water and environmental regulations, delivering on our commitment to public health and environmental stewardship.
Fourth quarter revenue was $135.7 million, a $9.9 million increase over reported fourth quarter 2019 revenue.
Net income for the quarter was $13.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share.
This compares with a net loss of $5.5 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter reflects lower CTWS merger expenses of $0.36 per share, higher customer usage of $0.22 per share and lower administrative and general expenses of $0.19 per share due to lower integration costs.
These increases were partially offset by an increase in production costs due to higher usage of $0.10 per share and a decrease of $0.05 per share due to lower local surface water availability in Northern California.
Turning to our comparative analysis for the quarter, our $9.9 million revenue increase was primarily due to increased customer usage of $6 million and $1.4 million in cumulative rate increases.
In addition, we recorded $2.8 million in customer rate credits in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of regulatory commitments we made in connection with the merger.
Water production expenses increased $3.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
The increase included $2.6 million in higher customer usage and $1.5 million for the purchase of additional water supply necessary to supplement California surface water.
Other operating expenses decreased $12 million during the quarter, primarily due to lower merger-related expenses of $9.7 million and lower general and administrative expenses of $5.1 million due to lower merger-related integration costs.
These decreases were partially offset by $2.5 million in higher depreciation expense.
The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was a negative 7% compared to 6% for the fourth quarter of 2019.
Turning to our annual results, 2020 revenue was $564.5 million, a 34% increase over the same period last year.
Net income in 2020 was $61.5 million or $2.14 per diluted share compared to $23.4 million or $0.82 per diluted share during the same period in 2019.
CTWS customer usage contributed $2.83 per share and customer usage from our other operations increased $0.59 per share.
Due to the timing of when the merger transaction closed in 2019, we only recorded $0.01 per share of earnings from CTWS in 2019.
In addition, 2019 non-recurring merger costs contributed $0.48 per share and the WCMA write-off in 2019 contributed $0.29 per share.
These increases were partially offset by increased production costs of $1.04 per share due to higher usage, a net increase in interest on long-term debt of $0.86 per share due primarily to merger-related debt, and 2020 note issuances and a decrease in local surface water availability in Northern California of $0.58 per share.
Our 2020 increase in revenue was primarily due to $111.2 million in increased customer usage, $12.2 million in cumulative rate increases and $2.7 million from new customers.
Water production expenses increased $50 million in 2020.
The increase was primarily due to $33.9 million in higher customer water usage from the addition of CTWS and drier weather, and a $19 million increase due to lower surface water supplies.
This increase was partially offset by $3.4 million of increase in California cost recovery balancing and memorandum accountants.
Other operating expenses increased $33.9 million in 2020, primarily due to a $23.7 million increase in depreciation expense, $13.4 million in higher general and administrative expenses and $10.8 million in higher property and other non-income taxes.

Turning to our capital expenditure program, we added approximately $65 million in Company-funded utility plant in the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing total Company-funded additions to $199.3 million.
Our 2020 cash flows from operations decreased approximately $25.9 million over the same period in 2019.
The decrease was primarily due to the authorized collection of $45.3 million of balancing and memorandum accounts in 2019, a decrease in collections of previously billed and accrued receivables of $15 million, a decrease in other non-current assets and liabilities of $12.4 million and a $50 million upfront payment we made to the city of Cupertino in connection with our service concession agreement.
