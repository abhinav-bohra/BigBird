Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $187 million.
Pretax margins were 12%, a 15-point improvement from the prior quarter.
Air Group's $187 million adjusted net income marks an inflection point on our path to recovery.
Our 12% pre-tax margin solidly led the industry and was just six points shy of our Q3 2019 margin.
With fourth of July and Labor Day passenger employments approach 2019 levels, even with the dampening impact that the Delta variant had on demand in August and beyond, our third quarter load factor came in at 80% and total revenue was down just 18% on a year-over-two basis.
a 15-point improvement sequentially from the second quarter.
Our unit costs were up 9% in the third quarter, meeting the better end of our guidance range.
The solid cost execution reflects incremental progress toward our productivity goals as passengers per FTE increased 6% sequentially, falling just 12 points below 2019 levels for the quarter.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we plan to increase our capacity to 13% to 16% below Q4 of 2019.
Year-to-date, we have made gross debt repayments of $1.2 billion, driving our debt-to-capitalization ratio down 10 points from year-end 2020 to 51% and moving within reach of our sweet spot for leverage between 40% to 50%.
This quarter, we took delivery of two more 737-9 aircraft and also exercised options for 12 incremental firm airplanes to be delivered in 2023 and 2024.
All told, we will have 93, 737-9 aircraft in our fleet by 2024 with options for 52 additional airplanes.
This fleet order not only replaces our departing Airbus 319 and 320 fleet but positions us for significant growth when demand comes back, which we expect will be in the back half of 2022.
We have a fantastic Boeing order book, creating flexibility for significant growth through 2025, a low-cost structure that allows us to compete with low fares, supported by a strong balance sheet, a great onboard product match with industry-leading customer service and operational performance, a powerful domestic West Coast network supported with the Oneworld Alliance, a brand with a fierce customer loyalty behind it and most importantly, a culture rooted in kindness and caring.
Our third-quarter revenues came in at $1.9 billion, down 18% versus 2019.
This was on flown capacity that was also down approximately 18%, resulting in near flat unit revenues.
Our revenue performance reflects a 15-point sequential improvement from last quarter, while capacity was just 3.5 points higher.
The load factor sequentially increased three points to 80% but the bigger revenue driver was strong sequential yields, which improved 13 points from last quarter to up 4% versus 2019.
On a monthly basis, loads were strongest in July at approximately 88%, then deteriorated to 81% in August and bottomed at 72% in September.
In the same time frame, yield deteriorated about five points from up 3.6% in July to down 1.5% in September, both on a year-over-two basis.
Geographically, Hawaii represents 16% of our capacity and was our weakest performing region during the quarter given the travel advisories for the state, which damaged demand for Hawaii.
Regarding our loyalty program, this quarter, we received the highest level of cash compensation in our airlines history, which was up 7% from the same quarter in 2019.
Reflecting on the year, we'll have added 30 new markets and only discontinued three.
Today, we're flying approximately 85% of our pre-COVID network.
California recovery remained slower as we flew 65% of 2019 capacity during the quarter.
So far in 2021, we've added 195 incremental codeshare routes with five Oneworld partners, increasing our codeshare portfolio by 43%.
Bookings deteriorated from down 20% in July to down 35% in August and floated with down 50% on a few booking days during the peak of the surge.
While that rate of recovery since the peak has been slower than we experienced after the last surge this spring, over the last seven days we've seen bookings recover to down 10% year over two.
Ultimately, we believe the Delta variant has reduced fourth-quarter revenues by approximately $200 million.
With this as our backdrop, we expect Q4 revenues to be down 16% to 19% on a year-over-two year basis.
However, our assumptions reflect weaker performance in October, with total revenue down approximately 25%.
So just looking at November and December, revenue is expected to be down between 13% and 16% right in line with our capacity reduction.
From a unit revenue perspective, October RASM is shaping up to be down about 10% versus 2019, while November and December could improve to nearly flat versus 2019.
We ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in total liquidity, inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit.
This is down from $4 billion of total liquidity in June as we paid down nearly $550 million in debt and made a $100 million voluntary pension contribution.
Debt repayment included retiring our $425 million 364-day loan and our pension contribution brings our funded status to 94% and also allowed us to capture a one-time permanent tax benefit of $14 million.
Fourth-quarter cash flows from operations are expected to be between negative $100 million and zero dollars exclusive of tax refunds and payments, which we expect to net to a positive $100 million in the quarter, depending on when we receive our anticipated 2020 tax refund.
Planned debt service for the remainder of the year is approximately $120 million, and we have no plans for further prepayments through the end of the year.
With this quarter's debt retirements, our debt to cap has dropped to 51%, placing us just shy of our intended range as Ben shared.
Today, our outstanding debt bears a relatively low weighted average effective rate of 3.3% and and our 2022 debt service is very manageable at about $375 million for the year, roughly 1/4 that of 2021.
Moving beyond 2022 annual debt services in the range of $250 million to $400 million.
As of now, I expect our total liquidity to move to approximately $2.5 billion in 2022.
This quarter, nonfuel costs were $1.3 billion with unit costs up 9.3% versus 2019, better than the guidance we issued in September.
Fuel costs rose again this quarter to $2.05 per gallon, up approximately 25% from where we started the year.
With crude at $70 per barrel for the quarter, our fuel hedges provided a $21 million benefit or $0.11 per gallon.
We currently have 50% of our planned fuel consumption hedged for the next six months at an average strike price of $61 in Q4 and $69 in Q1.
Our progression through 2021 has been solid with mainline CASMex compared to the same month in 2019, up 19% in June, up 7% in September, and likely to be up 4% to 5% in December.
Capacity in December compared to 2019 levels is expected to still be down 13%.
We're also seeing modest pressure in entry-level wages, which we believe is both an industry and general trend in the economy at large, and wage adjustments in this category are adding approximately $7 million for the fourth quarter.
Additionally, as we ramp to 100% of pre-COVID capacity, we are onboarding more employees earlier than we normally would, given our training throughput capacity.
Costs associated with additional training and carrying employees for the quarter are approximately $5 million.
Our cost restructuring targets are intact, and this quarter's results reflect realization of productivity savings, as well as the efficiencies of now seven, 737-9 aircraft flying for our mainline fleet.
As a result of the headwinds and tailwinds I've described, our expectations for Q4 unit costs is that they will be up 7% to 9% versus 2019 on roughly 15% lower capacity.
