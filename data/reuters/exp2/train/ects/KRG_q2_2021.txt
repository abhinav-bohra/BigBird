During the quarter, we leased 637,000 square feet, which is nearly double the amount of square footage as compared to the second quarter in 2019 and an additional 211,000 square feet sequentially.
Blended lease spreads were 14.7% and 9.2% on a GAAP and cash basis, respectively.
The outsized volume widens our total retail portfolio lease to occupied spread to 310 basis points with current signed, not opened NOI of approximately $12 million.
These seven leases are expected to generate cash yields of over 36%.
The strong box and small shop demand resulted in a portfolio retail leased rate of 91.5%.
This 100 basis point increase from last quarter is indicative of the continuing recovery in our financials.
While the last 18 months have been tumultuous, to say the least, through it all, we remain focused and work to operate from an offensive posture.
Our net debt to EBITDA currently sits at 6.4 times despite the fact that our lease rate dropped by over 500 basis points in 2020.
We generated $0.34 of NAREIT FFO, and we also generated $0.34 of FFO as adjusted.
As set forth on page 19 of our supplemental, the net 2020 collection impact in the second quarter was minimal with the collection of $1.6 million of prior bad debt, offset by $500,000 of accounts receivable, we now deem uncollectible.
Our same-property NOI growth for the second quarter is 10.1%, primarily driven by a reduction in bad debt as compared to the prior year period.
This includes the benefit of approximately $500,000 of previously not bad debt that we collected in the first quarter.
Excluding those amounts, our same-store NOI growth would be 8.9%.
That 120 basis point difference is just noise from 2020 and is precisely why we didn't provide guidance on this metric.
With respect to outstanding accounts receivable items, as of last Friday, the balance on our outstanding deferred rents stands at $2.1 million compared to $6.1 million as of December 31, 2020.
Furthermore, less than $0.5 million of deferred rent payments are currently delinquent, of which 70% is already reserved.
The current outstanding balance on our small business loan program is $1.2 million as compared to $2.2 million at inception and not a single borrower under the program is delinquent.
Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.4 times, down from 6.6 times last quarter.
Pro forma for the $12 million of signed-but-not-opened NOI, our net debt-to-EBITDA is six times.
Excluding future lease-up costs, we have only $17 million of outstanding capital commitments and of roughly $620 million of liquidity.
We are raising our 2021 guidance of FFO as adjusted to be between $1.29 and $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.02 at the midpoint.
Our guidance assumes full year 2021 bad debt of approximately $6.4 million, of which $2.6 million had been realized as of June 30, 2021.
