So 1.4 million more ounces we produced than what we had guided.
We are now producing 50% more than we were three years ago.
This growing U.S. silver production allowed us to generate $90 million of free cash flow in 2020.
But over the last 18 months, we've generated $152 million.
We now have $130 million in cash and $380 million in liquidity.
We accomplished this by recording our lowest [Audio gap] 1.22 in our history.
[Audio gap] began 2020 with our refinancing of our senior notes and extending the maturity of our long-term debt to 2028 and ended the year with $130 million in cash as we generated robust free cash flows of $90 million, aided by strong margins and higher prices.
Our adjusted EBITDA of $224 million reduced our net leverage ratio to 1.8, beating our target of less than two while providing a liquidity position of $380 million.
Our operations generated $53 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter with Lucky Friday generating positive cash flow of $1.7 million as the mine achieved full production in the quarter.
Turning to the income statement, you will note the two expense items for the year, loss on derivatives of $22 million and ramp-up costs of $24 million.
Included in that derivative loss is around $15 million for gold and silver puts we acquired to protect against downside price risks.
In addition, in 2021, our cash carry and maintenance costs are expected to be approximately 40% less than the cost incurred in 2020 due to the Lucky Friday mine being in full production.
Our all-injury frequency rate in 2020 was 1.22, which is a reduction of [Audio gap] I am very appreciative of the hard work and focus our operation teams deliver on these objectives.
At the Greens Creek mine, we produced 2.3 million ounces of silver and slightly less than 11,000 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $12.05 per ounce for the quarter.
2020 silver production at Greens Creek was 10.5 million ounces at an all-in sustaining costs of $8.57 per ounce.
Lucky Friday achieved full production in the fourth quarter and produced 2 million ounces in 2020, more than doubling the prior year's production.
2021 silver production at the mine is expected to be in the range of 3.4 million to 3.8 million ounces.
We anticipate the grades to improve as we mine deeper, increasing the projected production to around 5 million ounces annually over the next three to five years.
At Casa Berardi, we had a strong fourth quarter with production of 37,600 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,330 per ounce.
For 2020, Casa Berardi produced more than 121,000 ounces, in line with our COVID-adjusted guidance at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,436 per ounce.
Our investments in the mill to improve reliability and recovery are yielding great results as the mill broke monthly throughput records with greater than 90% availability for three consecutive months late in the year.
Our ongoing focus to improve productivity and reduce cost is underpinned by multiple factors and some of those are highlighted on Slide 12.
We realized a 10% increase in the underground active time reduced the equipment maintenance backlog by two and a half weeks and launch training for underground operators to increase equipment reliability.
These and other efforts increased the high-grade underground ore delivered to the mill by more than 20% in Q4.
The team is targeting a 10% reduction in support costs through a combination of restructuring, eliminating non value-adding work and negotiating key vendor contracts, including open-pit contract mining, explosive support services, and similar categories.
All these factors, together with the others in the pipeline, our position in Casa Berardi to deliver consistent production at lower costs, our 2021 guidance for Casa Berardi exceeds 125,000 ounces at a $1,185 to 1,275 per ounce AISC.
That decision resulted in $38.6 million of free cash flow, with a bit more to come this year, and a bulk sample of refractory ore.
We've initiated discussions with another processor and hope to send around 10,000 tons of stockpiled refractory ore to them for processing in the first half of 2021.
So, on Slide 14, it shows our consolidated production guidance for 2021 to 2023.
silver production is expected to reach roughly 15 million ounces by 2023, which is almost double our 2018 U.S. silver production.
