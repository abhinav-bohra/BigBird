Today's remarks are governed by the safe harbor provisions of the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
For a discussion of the risks associated with VPG's operations, we encourage you to refer to our SEC filings, especially the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our other recent SEC filings.
Moving to Slide 3, I'd like to begin my remarks by commenting that VPG's team around the world for their hard work and for their dedication during these challenging times as they adjusted quickly to local restrictions and extraordinary working conditions.
Moving to Slide 4, even in the rapidly changing market conditions over the past few months, and we are satisfied with our financial and operating performance in the first quarter.
We have ended the quarter with a positive book-to-bill of 1.08 and grew our total orders 4.4% from the same quarter a year ago.
Moving to Slide 5, I'll discuss the operational and EH&S impacts on VPG from COVID-19.
Financially, we have implemented a companywide salary freeze and have reduced our planned capital spending for 2020 by 30%.
Moving to Slide 5, in terms of the impact on demand for our products, one of VPG's strength is its broad diversity of VPG's markets, which is a major differentiator from other pure-play sensor technology companies during times of turbulent market conditions that we are seeing now.
For Foil Technology Products segment, first-quarter sales of $30.5 million grew 2.8% sequentially, reflecting growth in precision foil resistors and shrinkages in test and measurement and consumer markets, which offset weaker sales in the general industrial market.
Order for FTP in the first quarter grew from the fourth quarter of 2019 and included significant order for advanced sensors, which resulted in our book-to-bill of 1.25 as compared to 1.18.
First-quarter sales of Force Sensors of 14.7% -- $14.7 million declined 2.4% and from the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting slower demand in the industrial weighing markets as well as modest impact from a temporary government-mandated shutdown of our China facility.
While a book-to-bill for Force Sensors in Q1 was 1.02, we expect our second quarter sales for these products to be impacted by the essential shutdown of our manufacturing facility in Chennai, India that I mentioned earlier.
Assuming the full reopening of this facility on May 17, we expect that our Force Sensors revenues in the second quarter to be reduced by approximately $5 million to $7 million, which is reflected in our guidance.
We also expect our operating profit to be impacted by approximately $3.5 million, reflecting the lower revenues, the required payments to employees during the shutdown period and of some partial operations and higher logistics costs.
Sales of Weighing and Control Systems in the first quarter of $22.5 million declined 7.9% sequentially.
Book-to-bill for WCS was 0.9 in the first quarter of 2020.
We believe we have ample liquidity with a net cash of $42 million on our balance sheet and a new revolving credit facility we put in place in March 2020 that not only gives us expanded borrowing capacity should we need it, but also offers us lower borrowing rates and more favorable terms.
Referring to Page 7 of the slide deck.
