Starting on Slide 1.
With EBITDAX growing and excess cash used to reduce absolute debt going forward, we expect to lever the balance sheet rapidly and we are targeting a leverage ratio of less than two times at year end 2022 at $65 Brent.
Turning to Slide 2.
At $65 Brent, we expect the assets to generate around $1 billion of incremental free cash flow between now and the end of 2026 over two times our initial investment.
In our 1Q results earlier this year, we detailed the five-year goal to get production up to around 100,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent by 2026 when phases one and two of Tortue are expected online.
Turning now to Slide 3.
With the greenshoe, we issued around 43 million shares in total, raising approximately $140 million of equity in total.
We launched the senior notes offering the following week, issuing $400 million of 5.5 year notes, non-call two, which were priced at 7.75%.
Pro forma for the assets acquired, we expect our year-end exit productions to be greater than 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with pro forma EBITDAX of over $900 million for 2021, resulting in year-end pro forma leverage of around two and a half times.
Turning to Slide 4.
In Ghana, Jubilee is currently producing above 80,000 barrels of oil per day gross with a J-56 producer coming online in July and the J-55 water injector online in September.
This should result in Jubilee production exiting the year above 85,000 barrels per day.
At TEN, gross production is currently around 30,000 barrels of oil per day.
In Equatorial Guinea, gross production is currently around 30,000 barrels of oil per day.
In the Gulf of Mexico, as previously noted, production in the quarter was impacted by Hurricane Ida, which resulted in around 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent being shut in versus our previous guidance.
Turning to Slide 5, which looks at Tortue our world-class gas development.
We believe that Tortue phase two can deliver gas into Japan at a breakeven cost of just over $4 per MMBtu.
If we ignore the near-term elevated prices and look further out to December 2023, the chart shows a rerating of future price expectations with both JKM and TTF leveling out at around $10 per MMBtu, approximately double the same curve from a year ago.
The recent research note Morgan Stanley predicted that LNG demand is expect to rise twice as fast as supply through 2025 with prices expected to be 60% higher over the next five years versus the last five years on average.
We have contracted phase one volumes at a slope of around $0.10 to Brent, which means we'd be selling phase one gas at around $8 per MMBtu at current oil prices.
Turning to Slide 6.
On the Breakwater, we commenced fabrication of 20 of 21 caissons with 12 now installed.
Turning to Slide 7.
Production of approximately 49,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the quarter was in line with expectations, taking into account the unplanned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Ida that Andy talked about, which had an impact of around 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 3Q.
As guided last quarter, sales volumes for 3Q were expected to be low due to the number of cargo liftings, which resulted in a significant underlift of around 1.5 million barrels at the end of the quarter.
With 5.5 cargoes expected in Ghana and EG in the fourth quarter and down production restored to pre-hurricane Ida levels, we expect a significant cash inflow in the fourth quarter as we close out the year with more production selling at significantly higher realized prices.
Turning to Slide 8.
The equity debt mix we put in place to execute the Ghana transaction and then the acquired assets had a leverage multiple of less than two times using a trailing 12-month EBITDAX.
We have started to hedge the acquired barrels with two-way collars at a floor of $70 per barrel and a ceiling of around $90 per barrel.
