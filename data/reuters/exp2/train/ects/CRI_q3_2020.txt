Moving to Page 4 and our adjusted P&L for the third quarter.
Net sales declined 8% to $865 million, which is a meaningful improvement over the 30% decline we saw in the second quarter.
We continue to see strong demand online with our U.S. eCommerce business achieving a 17% comp and eCommerce comps in Canada up nearly 60%.

Royalty income was roughly comparable to last year at $9 million.
Adjusted SG&A declined to $24 million or 8% across a broad range of expense categories.
Adjusted operating income grew 4% to $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 13.8%, driven by our strong gross margin performance and management of spending.
Below line, we had higher net interest expense than last year due to the $500 million in new senior notes which we issued earlier this year.
We had other income of approximately $3 million in the quarter, largely foreign currency gains.
And our effective tax rate was about 19% in the quarter, up from about 18% last year.

Our Q3 accounts receivable balance declined 10% compared to last year, which reflects lower wholesale sales.
Accounts payable were $473 million at quarter-end compared to $206 million a year ago.
Long-term debt was $1 billion, up from $770 million in the third quarter of last year, which reflects our successful senior notes financing transaction in May and lower revolver borrowings.
In the third quarter, we repaid $244 million, which represented all of the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.
When considering our meaningful cash position, net debt at the end of the third quarter was $158 million compared to over $600 million at the end of Q3 last years.
