Today, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share.
This resulted in a charge of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter.
Absent this charge, our 2020 operating earnings would have been $2.54 per share.
For now, we are focusing on this year and we have introduced 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.
Last year, we also successfully executed our plan to invest $3 billion in our distribution and transmission systems as we continued our reliability in grid mod program to benefit customers.

In our distribution business, in addition to the $0.15 charge at our Ohio utilities, results for 2020 as compared to 2019 reflect the absence of Rider DMR in Ohio, which was in place for the first half of 2019 and higher operating costs.
Although total weather-adjusted sales decreased 2% in 2020, normal usage from our residential customers increased 5% for the year, which from an earnings perspective more than offset the 6% decrease in commercial and industrial loan.
While this shift has moderated as the pandemic wears on, we have seen higher weather-adjusted residential usage relative to our latest forecast in the 2% to 4% range with flat to slightly higher C&I usage.
In our transmission business, approximately $550 million in rate base growth drove stronger results, which were partially offset by higher financing costs, the impact of transmission rate true-ups and the absence of tax benefits recognized in 2019.
Today, we are providing 2021 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and first quarter operating earnings guidance in the range of $0.62 to $0.72 per share.
Our expectations for the year include capital investments of up to $3 billion, with 100% of the $1.2 billion in transmission investment and approximately 40% of the $1.7 billion in distribution investment being recovered in a formula rate.
We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher interest expense, which includes close to $0.04 per share associated with the step-up on $4 billion of holding company bonds, and $0.05 per share associated with our revolver borrowings that I'll address in a moment.
Equity remains a part of our overall financing plan, and we are affirming our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in 2022 and 2023, and we will flex these plans as needed.
At year-end, our liquidity was approximately $3 billion, with $1.7 billion of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of undrawn capacity under our credit facilities.
We currently have $2.2 billion of short-term borrowings, of which approximately $2.1 billion was incurred in November as a proactive measure to increase our cash position to preserve financial flexibility.
Our current maturities of long-term debt remain manageable with only $74 million maturing in 2021.
We are targeting future FFO to debt metrics in the 12% to 13% range at the consolidated level as we work to address some of the uncertainties that Chris and Steve mentioned.
We know how important the dividend continues to be for our investors in accordance with our target payout ratio of 55% to 65%.
The Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.39 in December, payable March 1.
And as we mentioned on our third quarter call, our intent is to hold the 2021 dividend flat to the 2020 level of $1.56 per share, subject to ongoing Board review and approval.
