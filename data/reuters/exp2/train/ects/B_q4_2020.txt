Given the historic challenges resulting from the global pandemic for most of 2020, I'm very proud of the many contributions of our 5,000 employees across the globe who stepped up to the challenge by going above and beyond to meet the needs of our customers and support our communities.
While we moved our current -- while we have moved our current focus to Phase 4, we have not lost sight of the first three phases as they continue to be important.
For the fourth quarter, organic sales were down 21%, primarily as a result of lower volumes given the pandemics' continuing impact on our end markets, especially at Aerospace.
The fourth quarter saw a 7% increase over the third quarter with both segments generating sequential sales improvement.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.36, down 58% from last year.
Looking at the full-year, organic sales were down 22%, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.64, down nearly 50% from a year ago.
Manufacturing PMIs in our major geographic markets remain strong and correspondingly, we've seen fourth quarter organic orders at Industrial grow 10% over a year ago.
Sequential Industrial orders were up 9% over the third quarter and segment book-to-bill was slightly better than 1 times.
Molding Solutions generated very strong orders in medical end markets, both year-over-year and sequentially, each with well over 50% growth.
Sales were up over 20% from a year ago.
However, sequential sales were strong increasing over 20%.
Although sales were relatively flat to a year ago, they were up 20% sequentially.
At Engineered Components, organic orders were up nearly 20% on a year-over-year basis, with organic sales up mid-single digits versus a year ago.
Total sales growth was strong with both year-over-year and sequential growth of 20%.
The vacuum product range consists of about 1,100 items, including high-performance suction cups, vacuum pumps, sensors and related accessories that allow our customers to handle different objects in various industrial sectors with low energy consumption and reduce downtime.
Overall, for the Industrial segment, we see 2021 organic growth in the low-double-digit range with adjusted operating margins of 12% to 14%.
For the fourth quarter, Barnes Aerospace sales were down nearly 40% at OEM and nearly 50% in the aftermarket from the prior year.
The OEM silver lining for the fourth quarter was book-to-bill of 1.6 times relative -- reflective of the strongest orders quarter since the third quarter of 2019.
One last point on our Aerospace business, OEM business, in particular, our estimates of OEM sales per aircraft for our major programs are unchanged from our prior view except for the 737 MAX.
With the award of the long-term agreement with GE Aviation on the LEAP program, mentioned on last quarter's call, we now forecast approximately $100,000 of sales per aircraft, up from our previous estimate of $50,000.
We anticipate 2021 segment operating margin to be in the range of 13% to 14%, surely compressed by the lower aftermarket expectation.
Let me begin with highlights of our fourth quarter results on Slide 4 of our supplement.
Fourth quarter sales were $289 million, down 22% from the prior year period, with organic sales declining 21% as continuing impacts from the pandemic affect our end markets.
The diversified Seeger business had a negative impact of 3% on our net sales for the fourth quarter, while FX positively impacted sales by 3%.

On an adjusted basis, net income per share of $0.36 was down 58% from an $0.86 a year ago.
Adjusted net income per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 excludes $0.01 of residual restructuring charges from previously announced actions with most of the impact reflected in other expense not operating profit.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted net income excludes a favorable $0.05 adjustment related to the finalization of Gimatic short-term purchase accounting and an $0.11 non-cash impairment charge related to the divestiture of Seeger, both in our Industrial segment.
Moving to 2020 full-year highlights on Slide 5 of our supplement.

For the year 2020, interest expense was approximately $15.9 million, a decrease of $4.7 million as a result of lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates.

The Company's effective tax rate in 2020 was 37.6% compared with 23.4% last year, with the increase largely due to a decline in earnings in jurisdictions with lower rates, the recognition of tax expense related to the completed sale of the Seeger business during the first quarter of 2020, the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income or guilty tax on foreign earnings in the US and tax charges related to prior year's stock awards.
