Today, we have had direct dialogue with all borrowers with over $3 million in exposure or 86% of our portfolio, and substantial dialogue below this level.
We have dedicated over a quarter of our workforce to avail our clients of this important program and have successfully approved over 2,600 applications totaling $1.5 billion today.
We anticipate funding approximately $150 million per day.
Our longer term solutions-based approach distinguishes us from industry standardized 90-day deferral programs.
This negotiation process has likely slowed our modification pipeline as approximately $400 million has been processed today.
Despite a uniquely challenging operating and rate environment, I am proud to report that in the first quarter, Western Alliance generated $163.4 million of operating pre-provision net revenue, up 10% year-over-year and 3% quarter-to-quarter.
We continued with the adoption of CECL accounting changes this quarter, which resulted in a provision for credit losses of $51.2 million for the quarter, 47% of which was driven by our robust balance sheet growth.
Dale will go into more detail in a bit on how the unique features of CECL drove our provisions, but our ACL to funded loan ratio now stands at 1.14%.
WAL generated net income of $84 million or $0.83 per share and tangible book value per share was $26.73.
This quarter, we produced a NIM of a 4.22% and had net recoveries of $3.2 million and continue to improve our operating leverage.
Deposits grew $2 billion to $24.8 billion as we gained market share in several of our key business lines as well as traction in one of our recently launched deposit initiatives, which added over $400 million.
Continuing on our strong momentum from 2019, total loans increased $2 billion to $23.1 billion.
Approximately $1.5 billion of this was through organic loan growth from new client projects and another $500 million was credit line drawdowns, of which approximately half was redeposited into the bank.
At quarter end, asset quality was stable with a decline in totally adverse graded loans and OREO to assets of 1.2% from 1.27% in Q4.

We remain well capitalized and highly liquid with the CET1 ratio of 9.7% and ample liquidity -- total liquidity resources of over $10 billion.
For the first quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $84 million or $0.83 earnings per share.
Net income was reduced by a $51.2 million provision for credit losses driven by the adoption of CECL, balance sheet growth as well as the change in the economic outlook due to pandemic.
Strong ongoing balance sheet momentum, coupled with diligent expense management, drove operating pre-provision net revenue to $163.4 million, up 10% from a year ago, which we believe is the most relevant metric to evaluate the ongoing earnings power of the company.
Net interest income and fee income remain relatively stable producing net operating revenue of $285.3 million, primarily a result of lower yields on loans, which was partially offset by lower rates on deposits and borrowings.
Non-interest income declined $10.9 million to $5.1 million from the prior quarter due to mark-to-market of preferred stock holdings of primarily large money center banks of $11.3 million, partially offset by $3.8 million equity investment gain.
To-date, of the $11.3 million mark, $3.5 million has been recovered.
Finally, non-interest expense declined $9.3 million as compensation and other operating expenses declined by $7 million.
Regarding implementing CECL in our allowance for credit losses, in our 10-K, we disclosed the adoption impact of $37 million, $19 million of which was attributable to funded loans, $15 million for unfunded commitments and $2.6 million for held-to-maturity securities.
This resulted in a combined January 1st allowance of $214 million.
During Q1, loan growth drove an additional $24 million of required reserves and another $30 million was driven by changes in the economic outlook as a result of the pandemic.
In total, reserve availed during the first quarter was $91 million, an increase of 50% from the year-end reserve.
The quarter end ACL of $268 million was 1.14% of funded loans, up 30 basis points.
Provision expense for the quarter was $51.2 million, which is over 10 times the average quarterly provision during 2019.
Net interest income for the quarter declined a modest $3 million from the prior quarter to $269 million as there was one less day during the quarter compared to Q4 and margin compression was offset by loan to deposit growth.
Investment yield showed a modest improvement of 2 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.98%.
However, on a linked quarter basis, loan yields increased 31 basis points due to the lower rate environment.
The average yield of our portfolio at quarter end or the spot rate was 5.02%.
Interest bearing deposit cost increased 18 basis points in Q1 to 90 basis points as a result of immediate steps taken to reduce our deposit costs after the FOMC cut rates twice in March.
The spot rate of total deposits at quarter end was 29 basis points.
Total funding costs decreased 11 when all of the company's funding sources are considered, including non-interest bearing and borrowings.
Through the transition to a substantially lower rate environment during the quarter, net interest income was $269 million, a decline of 1.1% from Q4.
Net interest margin declined 17 basis points to 4.22% during the quarter as their earning asset yield fell 28 basis points, partially offset by 19 basis points funding cost decrease.
Presently, 82% or $8.1 billion of variable rate loans with floors are at the floors.
With the addition of our mix shift primarily to fixed rate residential loans, $16.2 million or 70% of loans are now behaving as a fixed rate portfolio.
This has reduced our interest rate risk on a 100 basis point parallel shock lower scenario to 3% at March 31st from 6.5% one year ago and assumes that rates are held flat at zero across the term structure.
On a linked quarter basis, our efficiency ratio decreased 200 basis points to 41.8%.
Our core underlying earnings power remains strong as pre-provision net revenue ROA was 2.38%, flat from the prior quarter, while return on assets was down 70 basis points to 1.22% directly related to our provision expense in excessive charge-offs of $54.4 million.

Loan to deposit ratio increased to 93.2% from 92.7% in the fourth quarter.
Shareholders equity declined by $17 million as dividends and share repurchases were matched by net income.
Tangible book value per share increased $0.19 over the prior quarter to $26.73 per share as our share count declined.
Q1 is a seasonally strong deposit quarter, and coupled with the roll out of our deposit initiatives, deposits grew $2 billion.
The increase was driven by growth of $1.3 billion in non-interest bearing DDA primarily from market share gains in our mortgage warehouse operations.
Additionally, HOA continues to perform well and contributed $330 million of low cost deposits.
During the quarter, the relative proportion of non-interest bearing DDA grew to nearly 40% of deposits from 37.5% on a linked quarter basis.
In line with the industry, the vast majority of growth was driven by increases in C&I loans totaling $1.8 billion, followed by $107 million in construction and land development, and $92 million in residential.
Residential homes now comprise 9.7% of our portfolio, while construction loans decreased as a relative proportion of the portfolio to 8.9% from 9.2% in the fourth.

Corporate finance loans grew $408 million, which was primarily due to line draws, two-thirds of which were from investment grade borrowers bringing utilization rates to 38% from 13% during the prior quarter.
Mortgage warehouse also contributed to loan growth of $550 million, approximately 50% of which was due to line draws.
Across the bank, one quarter or about $500 million of our net new loan growth was driven by drawdowns on existing loan commitments from the beginning of the quarter.
In all, total loan growth of $2.2 million for the quarter was fully funded by deposit growth for the same amount.
Overall, asset quality was stable during the quarter with total adversely graded assets increasing $10 million during the quarter to $351 million, while non-performing assets comprised of loans on non-accrual and repossessed real estate increased $27 million to $97 million or 0.33% of total assets, and is now held-for-sale.
This quarter, we also -- we saw the cumulative impact of our efforts of managing certain special mention and substandard loans as several resolved in our favor with no losses, a $100 million of adversely graded loans resolved during the past quarter, 37 loans or $50 million paid-off in full, while the other $50 million were upgraded to pass.
We only incurred $100,000 of gross credit losses during the quarter, which was more than offset by $3.3 million in recoveries, resulting in net recoveries of $3.2 million.
In all, the ACL-to-funded loans increased 30 basis points to 1.14% in Q1 as a result of CECL adoption and the result in provision expense related to Q1 loan growth and changes in the economic outlook.
We continue to generate capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common equity, the total assets of 9.4% and a CET1 ratio of 9.7%.
In Q1, a reduction of TCE-to-total assets was mainly driven by $2.3 billion increase in tangible assets due to our significant loan growth, while the tangible common equity was affected by $15.4 million of provisions in excess of charge-offs due to CECL adoption.
In spite of reduced quarterly earnings and the payment of quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 per share, our tangible book value per share rose $0.19 in the quarter to $26.73 and is up 15.2% in the past year.

99% of the borrowers have revenues greater than $5 million and have strong institutional backing with 86% backed by one or more DC or PE firms.
During the quarter the portfolio grew $495 million to $2 billion or 8.8% of the total portfolio, which was attributed to $175 million of existing line drawdowns in the technology division and an additional $124 million from capital call lines, a product that historically has had zero losses.
Tech & Innovation commitments grew $284 million in Q1 and utilization rates increased to 60% from 49% in Q4 2019.
The portfolio is fairly granular with average loan size of $6 million and these borrowers are generally liquid with more than 2:1 deposit coverage ratio.
Additionally, since 2007, warrant income has covered cumulative net charge-offs 2 times over.
