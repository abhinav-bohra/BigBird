With respect to health and safety, I'm thrilled to report that our confirmed new resident cases in SHOP have fallen to literally a single person per day out of a resident population of 40,000.
Since then, led by our U.S. SHOP community, which posted 280 basis points of growth, we grew SHOP spot occupancy 190 basis points through April 30th to nearly 78%.
Our Canadian SHOP portfolio, which has maintained occupancy of over 91%, tempered the full SHOP occupancy growth because Canadian clinical conditions and regulatory measures are currently lagging those in the U.S.
In fact, move-ins during April at 1,880 totaled more move-ins in a single month than we've experienced at any time since June 2019.
The resilient and robust demand we are seeing for senior housing once again validates the need-based nature of our communities and the crucial role care providers play in facilitating longer, healthier lives for this portion of the nation's population, which is set to grow by over 2 million individuals over just the next few years.
Turning to our capital allocation approach, we are confident of our ability to recycle about $1 billion through property dispositions in the second half of this year, and those are expected to enhance our enterprise.
The Ventas portfolio, which now exceeds 9 million square feet, is located in three of the top five cluster markets and is affiliated with over 15 of the nation's top research universities.
We are also investing in our active and just delivered ground-up developments in life science, research and innovation, which totaled nearly $1 billion in project costs.
And I'm pleased to report that we also have another $1 billion in potential projects affiliated with major universities, right behind the four developments currently under way.
We recently expanded our life sciences business through our investment in a Class A portfolio of life science assets anchored by Johns Hopkins Medical, which we purchased at an attractive valuation of $600 per square foot.
Our two most recently completed high-end communities with LGM opened in the fourth quarter and have already achieved 87% occupancy.
We have three additional developments under way with LGM, representing nearly $300 million in aggregate project costs.
In a typical year, our deal team reviews over $30 billion in investment opportunities.
As Debbie noted, we are pleased with the improvement in leading indicators in occupancy as our move-in and move-out performance in March and April resulted in 266 and 363 net move-ins, respectively.
Construction starts continued to decelerate in the first quarter to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2011, and were down 77% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2017.
The 80-plus population is expected to grow 17% over the next five years, more than double the rate witnessed during the five-year recovery following the financial crisis.
Collectively, they account for 90% of our SHOP NOI on a stabilized basis.
Our trailing 12 cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported one quarter in arrears, is 1.3 times and stable versus the prior quarter.
Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI.
Core office grew 1.7% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially.
All-in, the office portfolio delivered $123 million of same-store cash NOI in the first quarter.
This represents an 80 basis-point reported sequential growth.
In our medical office portfolio, 88% of our NOI comes from investment-grade rated tenants and HCA.
In our life sciences portfolio, 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade rated organizations and publicly traded companies.
As an example, we are finishing negotiations on a 10-year 160,000 square foot renewal with a 16,000 square foot expansion with a leading health system in the southeast.
We relocated and extended several hospital offices on a Midwestern campus to accommodate the addition of a 50,000 square foot healthcare-focused technical college.
Medical office had record level retention of 91% for the first quarter and 86% for the trailing 12 months.
Driven by this retention, total office leasing was nearly 1 million square feet for the quarter.
This includes 160,000 square feet of new leasing.
The result is that MOB occupancy stayed essentially flat, down only 10 basis points for the quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year.
In 2020, we redeployed 30% of our third-party brokers.
And in 2020, we increased the number of third-party brokers by 70% to impact the local coverage.
Average length of term for new leases was 7.3 years, 5 months higher than the 2019 average.
Average escalators for new leasing was 2.7%, higher than our average in-place escalator of 2.4%.
We've invested over $2 million in a pilot across 20 suites.
These projects have driven 20 basis points of occupancy and created a nearly 20% return on investment.
We continue to make progress on our recently announced $2 billion pipeline of development opportunities with Wexford.
We've publicly announced four projects in that pipeline, Arizona State University in Phoenix, which opened in the fourth quarter and is soon to be over 70% leased.
Drexel University College of Nursing in Philadelphia is 100% leased.
The project, in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh for immunotherapy is 70% preleased.
Since the acquisition of our South San Francisco life science trophy asset, we have renewed several tenants and have driven occupancy to 100%.
In some cases, the mark-to-market has exceeded 30%.
At our newest life sciences acquisition on the Johns Hopkins Campus in Baltimore, we are in lease negotiations to take the buildings from 96% to 100% occupancy.
During the first quarter, our healthcare triple-net assets showed continued strength and reliability with 100% rent collections in April and May.
Trailing 12-month EBITDARM cash flow coverage through 12/31 improved sequentially for all of our healthcare triple-net asset classes.
Acute care hospitals' trailing 12-month coverage was a strong 3.5 times in the fourth quarter, a 20 basis-point sequential improvement.
IRF and LTAC coverage improved 10 basis points to 1.7 times in the first quarter, buoyed by strong business results and government funding.
Ventas reported first quarter net income of minus $0.15 per share, driven by noncash charges in the quarter as we transferred assets to held for sale.
Normalized funds from operations in the first quarter was $0.72 per share, a $0.01 beat versus the high end of our prior guidance range of $0.66 to $0.71.
As previously communicated and included in our Q1 guidance range, we received $0.04 in HHS Grants in SHOP in Q1.
Adjusted for these grants, Q1 FFO per share was $0.68.
As a result, same-store SHOP NOI declined sequentially by 8% in the second quarter versus the first.
Second quarter net income is estimated to range from flat to $0.07 per fully diluted share.
Our guidance range for normalized FFO for Q2 is $0.67 to $0.71 per share.
The Q2 FFO midpoint of $0.69 is $0.01 higher sequentially than the first quarter results due to an improving SHOP trajectory, after adjusting for HHS Grants in both periods.
Q2 spot occupancy from March 31st to June 30th is forecast to increase between 150 to 250 basis points, with the midpoint assuming the occupancy improvement in March and April, continues through May and June.
And finally, we continue to assume $1 billion in proceeds from property dispositions in the back half of 2021.
We continue to enjoy robust liquidity with $2.7 billion as of May 5th.
Notably, in the first quarter, we renewed our revolver at better pricing and improved our near-term maturity profile by fully repaying $400 million of senior notes due 2023.
In terms of capital structure, we maintained total debt to gross asset value at 37% in the first quarter.
Q1 net debt-to-EBITDA was 7.1 times, as EBITDA continued to feel the impacts of COVID in the quarter.
