Our expectation remains to be at the high end or above our 8% to 10% earnings per share growth target in the intermediate and longer term.
Intermediate term expectations are primarily based on recovering sales momentum, strong fees on assets under management, incremental expense management initiatives and the combination of $900 million of buybacks related to our recent block sale and ongoing share repurchases.
After introducing 10 new products since the beginning of the year, including the industry's first combined life plus long-term care policy built on a variable chassis, we have more updates planned and additional products in development.
In Annuities, we reported sales growth of 7% and over the prior year quarter, driven by our industry-leading product breadth and distribution force plus shelf space added over the last two years.
Total deposits were up 2% despite being negatively impacted by some sales shifting into the fourth quarter.
While we reported slightly negative flows this quarter, trailing 12-month net flows remained strong at positive $1.2 billion, and we expect full year 2021 net flows to be positive.
In life insurance, our focus on expanding both consumer value propositions and distribution shelf space resulted in sequential sales growth of 32% this quarter with sales totaling $166 million and all product categories reporting double-digit increases.
In addition to the property and casualty distribution partnership we added in the second quarter -- We recently launched our variable MoneyGuard product at two of our largest strategic partners, providing 25,000 more advisors with access to this first-of-its-kind solution.
Lastly, our Group Protection business continues to be impacted by the pandemic particularly as the Delta variant affected more individuals under age 65 driving increased claims.
We achieved 5% premium growth over the prior year which is a result of a stronger persistency rate of nearly 90% and renewal rate increases implemented earlier this year.
59% of Group Protection sales have come from these products as more individuals see the value of them.
We will continue to build on our progress and expect margins to grow toward the top end of our 5% to 7% target range.
Our general account portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed income investments, of which 97% are investment-grade equivalent.
During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 2.6% with 1/2 in shorter-duration assets versus 1/3 for the full year 2020.
Approximately 60% of our purchases were in investments other than public corporates, providing diversification and good relative value and yielding approximately 100 basis points over comparability rated public corporates.
Lastly, our alternative investment performance was once again strong with an 8% return in the quarter, exceeding our long-term targeted quarterly return of 2.5%.
In sum, our underlying earnings power is improving, and we remain confident in our ability to grow earnings per share at or above our 8% to 10% target range.
Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted operating income of $307 million or $1.62 per share.
Also, this quarter's results were impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $180 million or $0.95 per share.

This quarter's impact for 10,000 COVID deaths of $6 million was down year-over-year as expected, but was up sequentially and as the severity of our average COVID claim was elevated.
In addition to the impacts of the pandemic, underlying mortality was negatively impacted by $34 million.

Cash at the holding company stands at $754 million, above our $450 million target as we have prefunded our $300 million 2022 debt maturity.
We deployed $200 million toward buybacks in the third quarter.
In line with our goal communicated last quarter to have full year buybacks in line with pre-pandemic levels of approximately $600 million, excluding any incremental buybacks from transactions.
Our block sale with Resolution Life, which we announced in September and closed on October 1, generated approximately $1.2 billion of capital, $900 million of which we plan to use for incremental share repurchases.
