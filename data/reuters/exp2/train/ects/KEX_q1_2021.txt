A list of these risk factors can be found in Kirby's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Earlier today, we announced a net loss of $0.
06 a share for the 2021 first quarter.
In the refining complex, utilization in PADD III, which is the Gulf Coast, declined to 41%.
It did not fully recover back above 80% until the end of March.
Operating rates at nameplate ethylene plants in Texas declined from 86% in January to the year, 40% in February and March, corresponding to a 51% decline in production and feedstock consumption.
At the height of the storm, the majority of capacity and production was off-line, including 75% of U.S. ethylene capacity.
More than 80% of U.S. olefins capacity, 90% of ethylene glycol production, more than 80% of polypropylene production, 65% of propylene production and over 60% of epoxy resins production.
Overall, we estimate the winter storm directly contributed to losses totaling approximately $0.09 per share during the first quarter.
However, toward the end of the quarter, refinery utilization recovered to over 80%, and most chemical plants came back online.
As a result, our barge utilization recovered late in the quarter and by early April, it was over 80%.
In the 2021 first quarter, marine transportation revenues were $301 million with an operating income of $1.9 million and an operating margin of 0.6%.
Compared to the 2020 first quarter, marine revenues declined $102.3 million or 25%, and operating income declined $48.8 million.
Compared to the 2020 fourth quarter, revenues increased slightly by $1.5 billion, inclusive of increased rebuilds related to higher fuel prices, partially offset by a reduction in freight revenue.
Operating income declined $27.2 million, largely due to the impact of significant disruptions and winter store-related volume reductions particularly as it related to contracts of affreightment as well as lower term and spot pricing in inland.
During the quarter, the inland business contributed approximately 75% of segment revenue.
Long-term inland marine transportation contracts are those contracts with a term of one year or longer contributed approximately 65% of revenue with 61% from time charters and 39% from contracts of affreightment.
Average spot market rates declined approximately 5% sequentially and 25% to 30% year-on-year.
During the first quarter, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was approximately 80%, of which approximately 85% were time charters.
Revenues for the 2021 first quarter were $195.9 million with an operating income of $2.9 million and an operating margin of 1.5% compared to the 2020 first quarter, distribution and services revenues declined $44.8 million or 19%, and operating income declined $0.8 million.
Compared to the 2020 fourth quarter, overall demand for our products and services steadily improved, with revenues increasing $5.6 million or 3% and operating income increasing $5.8 million.
During the first quarter, the commercial and industrial businesses represented approximately 68% of segment revenue.
For the first quarter, the oil and gas related businesses represented approximately 32% of segment revenue and had a negative operating margin in the mid-single digits.
As of March 31, we had $52 million of cash and total debt of $1.35 billion, with a debt-to-cap ratio of 30.
During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $103 million, which included a tax refund of $117 million.
In the quarter, we repaid $120 million of debt and use cash flow and cash on hand to fund capital expenditures of $14 million.
At the end of the quarter, we had total available liquidity of $776 million.
Looking forward, capital spending in 2021 is expected to be approximately $125 million to $145 million, which represents nearly a 10% reduction compared to 2020 and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for marine fleet.
We anticipate improvement in the third and fourth quarters as the economy continues to recover, refinery and chemical plant production continues to grow and our barge utilization improves above the 82% to 84% we've seen in April.
In the inland market, with our barge utilization starting in the second quarter over 80%, most refineries and chemical plants back online and improving weather conditions, we expect better results going forward.
With little construction of new barges and retirements of barges occurring across the industry, we expect an improvement in the spot market and our barge utilization to move up into the high 80% to low 90% range in the second half of the year.
We also expect increased thermal product -- Thermo-King product sales and in power generation, demand for new equipment parts and services is expected to grow as the need for 24/7 power becomes increasingly more important.
We anticipate significant year-over-year growth in revenues and operating income with commercial and industrial representing approximately 70% of segment revenues in oil and gas, representing the balance of 30%.
