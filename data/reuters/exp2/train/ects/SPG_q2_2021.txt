Please note, our 8-K filing is still in process with the SEC.
Second-quarter funds from operations were $1.22 billion or $3.24 per share.
Our international operations continue to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions, which cost us roughly $0.06 per share for this quarter compared to our expectations due to the equivalent of a two-and-a-half month of closures.
We generated over $1 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, which was $125 million more than the first quarter.
Domestic-international property NOI combined increased 16.6% year over year for the quarter and 2.8% for the first half of the year.
Malls and outlets occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 91.8%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the first quarter.
Average base minimum rent was $50.03.
It would add approximately $5 per foot to our average base minimum rent.
Leasing spreads declined again due to mix of deals that are now included, as well as the activity that had fallen out of the spread given its rolling 12-month nature and metric.
We signed nearly 1,400 leases for approximately 5.2 million square feet and had a significant number of leases in our pipeline.
Through the first six months, we signed 2,500 leases for over 900 -- I'm sorry, 9.5 million square feet.
Our team executed leases for 3 million more square feet or over approximately 800 more deals compared to the first six months this year, as well as -- I'm sorry, compared to the first six months of 2019.
We have completed nearly 90% of our expiring leases for 2021.
Total sales for the month of June were equal to June 2019 and up 80% compared to last year and were approximately 5% higher than May sales.
If you exclude two well-known tenants, our mall sales were up 8% more than compared to June of 2019.
The end of the quarter, new development/redevelopment was underway across all our platforms for our share of $850 million.
All of our global brands within SPARC Group outperformed their budget in the quarter on sales, gross margin and EBITDA, led by Forever 21 and Aeropostale.
Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.4 billion, and they do not have any outstanding balance on their line of credit.
Year to date through June, retail sales are 13% higher than the first half of 2019.
We refinanced 13 mortgages in the first half of the year for a total of $2.2 billion in total, our share of which is $1.3 billion at an average interest rate of 2.9%.
Our liquidity is more than $8.8 billion, consisting of $6.9 billion available on our credit facility and $1.9 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash.
And again, our liquidity is net of $500 million of US commercial paper that's outstanding at quarter-end.
We paid $1.40 per share of dividend in cash on July 23 for the second quarter.
That was a 7.7% increase sequentially and year over year.
Today, we announced our third-quarter dividend of $1.50 per share in cash, which is an increase of 7.1% sequentially and 15.4%, 15.4% year over year.
Given our results for the first half of the year, as well as our view for the remainder of 2021, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance range from $9.70 to $9.80 per share to $10.70 to $10.80 per share.
This is an increase of $1 per share at the midpoint, and the range represents approximately 17% to 19% growth compared to 2020 results.
First, we expect to generate approximately $4 billion in FFO this year.
That will be approximately 25% increase compared to last year and just 5% below our 2019 number.
To be just 5% below 2019, given all that we've endured over the last 15, 16 months, including significant restrictive governmental orders that forced us to shut down unlike many other establishments is a testament to our portfolio and a real testament to the Simon team and people.
Second, we expect to distribute more than $2 billion in dividends this year.
Our valuation continues to be well below our historical averages when it comes to multiple -- FFO multiples compared to other retail REITs, retailers and the S&P 500.
And our dividend yield is higher than the S&P 500 by more than 250 basis points, treasuries by 325 basis points and the REIT industry by 150 basis points.
