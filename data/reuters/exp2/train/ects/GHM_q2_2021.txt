It was very nice to operate in Q2 a normal capacity after running at approximately 50% capacity in Q1 due to COVID-19.
Q2 sales were $28 million, up from $21.6 million in Q2 of last year.
Sales in the defense, the Navy market were $9.4 million in the quarter.
Year-to-date, defense sales were $12.9 million or 29% of sales.
We would expect around 25% of our sales to be for the Navy for the full fiscal year.
Q2 net income was $2.7 million or $0.27 per share, up from $1.2 million or $0.12 per share last year.
Cash is still good at nearly $68 million.
Finally, orders in the quarter were $35 million, driven by strong international refining awards in Asia and defense in the United States.
Our backlog improved to $114.9 million.
I discussed the sale detail on the last slide with the quarter at $28 million.
Sales in the second quarter was 62% domestic, 38% in international.
Last year's second quarter was 73% domestic, 27% international.
Gross profit in the quarter was -- increased to $7.7 million, up from $4.9 million last year, primarily due to volume.
Gross margins were 27.5%, up from 22.9%.
EBITDA margins were 14.2%, up from 7.8% in last year's second quarter.
And finally, net income was $2.7 million, up from $1.2 million last year.
For the first half of fiscal 2021, sales were $44.7 million compared with $42.2 million in the first half of last year.
This increase was despite the challenging Q1 when our production capacity was at 50% due to COVID-19.
Year-to-date sales are 60% domestic, 40% international compared with 71% domestic and 29% international last year.
Gross profit was $9.3 million, slightly off the $9.7 million last year, and gross margins were down 20.7% versus 22.9% last year, again, impacted by COVID-19 in the first quarter.
Year-to-date EBITDA margins were 4.9% versus 4.5% in the first half of last year, and net income was $900,000 or $0.09 per share, down from $1.3 million or $0.13 per share last year.
Cash is at $67.9 million, down from $73 million at the end of fiscal 2020, but this is simply timing of working capital namely accounts receivable and accounts payable.
Our quarterly dividend remains firm at $0.11 a share.
Capital spending has been light in the first half of the year at $800,000 compared to $700,000 last year.
As we have seen in the last few years, our capital spending will increase in the second half of the year, and we still expect the total spend for the year to be between $2 million and $2.5 million.
Sales for the second quarter were $28 million.
Sales to defense industry were up $6.8 million year-on-year due to prior -- due to the prior mentioned materials order and greater defense conversion as we continue to grow our naval workforce.
Lastly, and importantly, due to the strength of our backlog, annual guidance has been increased from $90 million to $95 million to $93 million to $97 million.
Please move on to slide 10.
We now have the capacity to train up to 10 welders up from 5.
I'll begin my remarks starting with slide 12.
As a result of this strategy, $10 million of new orders for India were secured in the quarter.
Let's move on to slide 13.
The Indian work mentioned a moment ago, plus approximately $10 million in additional orders fiscal year-to-date that are for Asia.
On a positive note, an engineering-only order for a large crude oil refinery revamp was secured, that we hope proceeds within the next 12 months.
If and when it proceeds into fabrication, we anticipate that a change order will exceed $5 million.
Crude oil below $40 a barrel and pandemic-driven global disruption have resulted in activity being pulled in by most national integrated and independent oil refiners.
We have identified and are pursuing $40 million to $60 million of opportunities for the Navy, and they should be placed with a selected vendor over the next nine months.
Short cycle work is off 20% to 30%.
Let's now move on to slide 14.
Backlog is a healthy $115 million, split evenly between commercial and defense.
60% to 65% of backlog is planned to convert during the next four quarters with approaching 40% of backlog planned to convert during the next two fiscal quarters.
We've increased the revenue range to between $93 million and $97 million, implying the second half should be between $48 million and $52 million for revenue.
Gross margin is expected to be between 21% and 23%.
SG&A spend between $17 million and $17.5 million.
And we're projecting the effective tax rate is approximately 22%.
