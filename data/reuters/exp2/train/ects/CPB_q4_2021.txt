On Slide 4, you will see today's agenda.
For the full year, I'm pleased to report that Campbell's organic net sales were comparable to fiscal 2020 and grew 3% on a two-year compounded annual growth basis driven by both divisions, reflecting strong end market performance.
However, on a two-year CAGR, adjusted EBIT grew 5% and adjusted earnings per share grew 14% as we de-levered and improved our balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 7, full-year organic net sales were comparable to prior year, which included a positive fourth quarter finish to fiscal 2021 in light of last year's remarkably strong performance.
Organic net sales declined 4% as we lapped a 12% growth than the prior year and delivered 4% growth on a two-year CAGR basis.
In Snacks, we delivered sequential operating margin improvement of 270 basis points versus the third quarter despite the continued industry wide supply chain challenges.
For the full year, 75% of our brands grew or held share versus the prior year, and the majority of our brands in our 13 core categories grew ahead of pre-COVID levels.
Total company in-market consumption was minus 1% compared to fiscal 2020, on a 52-week basis.
Importantly, compared to the fiscal 2019 period, consumption grew 10%, driven equally by strength in both our Meals and Beverages and Snacks divisions, as we continue to make material advances in attracting and retaining consumers, especially the critical Millennial cohort.
Turning to our division performance on slide 9, let me begin with Meals & Beverages.
Our 4th quarter organic net sales decline of 9% and end market performance of minus 2% reflects cycling the partial inventory recovery and elevated consumption levels in the prior-year quarter.
On a two-year basis, we delivered strong consumption growth of 13% against organic net sales growth of 10%, narrowing the gap as our foodservice business continued to stabilize.
On US Soup, we delivered another quarter of record share growth of nearly 2 points, with gains in all segments.
US Soup two-year dollar sales growth of 16% in the fourth quarter exceeded the growth in total shelf stable meals and was just slightly behind total edible growth in that same time period.
Ready to serve end market consumption grew an impressive 21% on a two-year basis, led by Chunky, Slow Kettle and the successful relaunch of Well Yes!
On Swanson broth, we increased our share by 3.7 points, our highest quarter of share growth in over three years, driven by our investment in supply recovery.
Prego delivered its best year of dollar share gains in four years and maintained the number one share position for 27 consecutive months.
The brand grew in market consumption on a two-year basis and delivered 5% growth over the prior year.
Household penetration was elevated versus fiscal 2019 in every quarter and grew 1 points in the fourth quarter.
On Slide 11, we are excited to share with you a glimpse into our Meals & Beverages innovation plans for fiscal 2022.
This quarter was the second highest 13-week quarter of net sales for the Snacks division since the Snyder's-Lance acquisition.
Organic net sales grew 1% over the prior year quarter and 7% on a two-year basis.
In-market performance declined only 1% year-over-year, but grew 11% on a two-year basis.
Turning to our Snacks Power brands, which continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 2% this fiscal year and 15% on a two-year basis driven by double-digit consumption growth in the majority of our brands.
Turning to Goldfish, we delivered sustained share growth, increasing for a second quarter in a row by more than 1 point compared to this time last year.
On Slide 17, we do expect the challenging environment in fiscal 2022 as COVID persists and inflation in labor availability remain highly volatile.
Turning to Slide 19 for the fourth quarter organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the additional week and the impact of the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business declined 4% as we cycled both the elevated demand in food purchases for at-home consumption, and a partial retailer inventory recovery in the prior year.
Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, which we view to be more meaningful given the COVID-19 impact to prior year, organic net sales increased 4% on a two-year CAGR.
Adjusted EBIT decreased 13% compared to prior year, to $267 million driven by lower sales volume, including the impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter and a lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and lower adjusted administrative expenses.
Our adjusted EBIT margin was 14.3% compared to 14.6% in the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.08 or 13% versus prior year to $0.55 per share, partially driven by the estimated $0.04 contribution from the additional week in fiscal 2020.
For the full-year organic net sales, which excludes the impact from the additional week, divestitures hence the impact of currency were comparable to the prior year and grew 3% compared to fiscal 2019 on a two-year CAGR basis.
Compared to prior year, Meals & Beverages organic net sales decreased 1% driven by declines in foodservice, partially offset by growth in V8 beverages.
Full-year adjusted EBIT decreased 3% versus the prior year to $1.4 billion.
Our marketing and selling expenses represented 9.6% of net sales compared to 10.9% last year.
Full year 2021 adjusted EBIT margin was 16.6% compared to 16.7% in the prior year.
Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operation increased 1% to $2.98 per share.
Organic net sales decreased 4% during the quarter lapping an increase of 12% in the prior year quarter when the demand for at-home consumption remained elevated and retailers partially recovered on the inventory.
The organic net sales decline was driven by a 5 points headwind due to volume declines, partially offset by favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending, which each drove a 1 point gain in the quarter.
The impact of one last week in the quarter subtracted 7 points and the recent sale of Plum subtracted 1 point.
All in, our reported net sales declined to 11% from the prior year stronger than anticipated as in-market demand remained elevated.
Turning to Slide 22, our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin decreased by 420 basis points from 35.6% last year to 31.4% this year, which was generally consistent with our expectations.
Mix and operating leverage had a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points and 40 basis points respectively on gross margin, as we continue to transition from last year's elevated demand.
Net pricing drove a 100 basis point improvement due to lower levels of promotional spending in the quarter as well as favorable price and sales allowances, which do not yet reflect the price increases effective first quarter of fiscal 2022.
Inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 640 basis points with slightly more than half of the decline driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 5%.
Our ongoing supply chain productivity program contributed 150 basis points to gross margin, partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds.
Our cost savings program, which is incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program added 80 basis points to our gross margin.
Moving on to other operating items, adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased $91 million or 34% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.
A&C declined 52% reflecting our elevated pandemic driven level of investment in the prior year to attract and retain new households.
Overall, our adjusted marketing and selling expenses represented 9.3% of net sales during the quarter, a 330 basis point decrease compared to last year.
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased $30 million or 18% with approximately one-half of the decrease, driven by the estimated impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter.
Adjusted administrative expenses represented 7.4% of net sales during the quarter, a 60 basis point decrease compared to last year.
This quarter, we achieved $25 million in incremental year-over-year savings, which came in ahead of our expectations, resulting in full-year savings of $80 million, with the majority of the savings from the Snyder's-Lance integration.
We remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.
On slide 25, we are providing a total company adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter.
As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined by 13% as the net sales decline, including the impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter and the 420 basis point gross margin contraction resulted in a $84 million and $77 million EBIT headwind respectively.
Partially offsetting this was lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, contributing 330 basis points to adjusted EBIT margin and lower adjusted administrative and R&D expenses contributing 50 basis points.
The estimated impact to EBIT from the additional week in fiscal 2020 was $22 million.
Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by only 30 basis points to 14.3%.
The following chart breaks down our adjusted earnings per share change between our operating performance and below the line items, a $0.10 impact of lower adjusted EBIT and a $0.01 impact of higher adjusted taxes, partially offset by a $0.03 favorable impact from lower interest expense resulted in better than expected adjusted earnings per share of $0.55, down $0.08 from $0.63 per share in the prior year, of which an estimated $0.04 was driven by the additional week in fiscal 2020.
In Meals & Beverages, declines across US retail products, including US Soup, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces led to a 9% decrease in fourth quarter organic net sales compared to the prior year.
However for the comparable period in fiscal 2019, organic net sales increased 10%.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, sales of US Soups decreased 21%, 7 points of which were driven by the additional week in the prior year, while at the same time cycling a 52% increase in the prior year quarter.
Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 30% to $129 million.
Overall within our Meals & Beverages division, fourth quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 290 basis points to 15.2%.
Within Snacks, organic net sales increased 1% to $1 billion, driven by volume gains in Goldfish crackers and our salty snacks portfolio including Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels, and Cape Cod potato chips, partially offset by declines in partner brands and fresh bakery, favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending also contributed to sales growth.
Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Snacks organic net sales grew 7%.
Operating earnings for Snacks increased 7% for the quarter, driven by lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by sales volume declines, including the impact of the additional week and a lower gross margin.
Overall within our Snacks division, fourth quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 170 basis points to 14.2%.
Fiscal 2021 cash flow from operations decreased from $1.4 billion in the prior year to $1 billion primarily due to changes in working capital, mostly from a significant increase in accounts payable in the prior year and lower accrued liabilities in the current year.
Our year-to-date cash for investing activities was reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $275 million, which was slightly lower than the prior year driven by discontinued operations and the net proceeds from the sale of Plum.
Our year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $1.7 billion, reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $439 million as we continue to focus on delivering meaningful return of cash to our shareholders.
Additionally, we reduced our debt by $1.2 billion.
We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $69 million.
In June, the Board authorized a $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs.
We expect organic net sales to be minus 1% to plus 1%, adjusted EBIT of minus 8% to minus 5%, and adjusted earnings per share of minus 8% to minus 4% versus the fiscal 2021 results.
Fiscal 2021 results include a $0.12 benefit from mark-to-market gains on outstanding commodity hedges and an approximate $0.02 adjusted earnings per share contribution from Plum.
As you see on Slide 31, we expect core inflation for the year to be high single digits with a more pronounced impact in the second half of fiscal 2022, which we plan to address with price increases in trade optimization, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization.
Moving to additional assumptions, we expect ongoing supply chain productivity gains of approximately 2% to 3% for the year excluding the benefit of our cost savings program.
As previously mentioned, we expect to continue to progress on our cost savings program and expect to deliver an incremental $45 million in fiscal 2022, keeping us on track to deliver $850 million by the end of the fiscal year.
Additionally, we expect net interest expense of $190 million to $195 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%, which is largely in line with fiscal 2021.
While cognizant of our current operating environment, we expect to continue to invest in the business, targeting capital expenditures of approximately $330 million, which includes carryover projects from fiscal 2021.
