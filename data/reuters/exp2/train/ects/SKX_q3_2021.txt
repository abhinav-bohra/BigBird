Skechers third quarter revenue of $1.55 billion was a new record for the period and a remarkable achievement given the ongoing global supply chain disruptions just discussed.
For the nine months period we also achieved a sales record of over $4.6 billion.
Quarterly gross margin remained strong at 49.6% primarily driven by higher average selling prices and fewer promotions in our direct-to-consumer business, partially offset by increases in freight costs.
The third quarter sales gain of 19% was the result of a 20% increase in our domestic business and a 19% increase in our international business, which represented 58% of our total sales for the period.
Skechers direct-to-consumer business achieved the highest quarterly sales gains, increasing 44%, driven by a 61% increase in our international business and a 35% increase in our domestic business.
Worldwide comparable same-store sales increased 31% including 34% domestically and 25% internationally.
Importantly, unit volume improved 17% with an average selling price per unit increase of 23%, reflective of our less promotional stance, the success of our Comfort Technology product and a return to a more normal lifestyle and shopping behavior.
The increase in our domestic direct-to-consumer business was driven by a 43% gain in our brick-and-mortar stores where we saw higher traffic and normalized operating hours.

Our joint venture business increased 5% for the quarter due to a 10% increase in China, as well as strong sales in Mexico and Israel.
