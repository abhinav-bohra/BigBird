Specifically, we require 100% of the crew to be fully vaccinated.
The only exceptions are children under 12 and, in Florida, a minor number of people who choose not to get vaccinated.
Excluding Singapore, which is a special case, an average of 92% of the people onboard our ships in July were fully vaccinated.
Some of the key achievements include a 35% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions from our 2005 baseline.
We removed 60% of single-use plastics from our supply chain.
60% of our ships are equipped with emissions purification systems that remove 98% of sulfur oxides.
We've reduced waste to landfill by 85% from our 2007 baseline.
And we've also completed the introduction of over 2,000 certified tours in three assessments by the Global Sustainability Tourism Council.
One interesting point is that our wind farm that spans 20,000 acres in Northern Kansas has 62 turbines with a total power generation capability of 200 megawatts.
It will annually generate 760,000 megawatt-hours of carbon-free energy.
That's saving some 500,000 tons in carbon.
And to put it in perspective, it's the equivalent to the energy use of about 60,000 homes.
The last 16 months have caused much pain and much suffering, but the tide is clearly turning.
And as of today, our customer deposit balance is $2.5 billion.
At this point, a little over 35% of our customer deposit balance is associated with FCCs, compared to about 45% at the time of our last call, signaling continued strong demand.
On the liquidity front, we closed the second quarter with $5 billion in liquidity.
These assets and attributes have been instrumental in helping us raise more than $13 billion of new capital since March of last year.
And to that end, we successfully issued $650 million of senior unsecured notes at 4.25% and used those proceeds to redeem 7.25% senior secured notes in full.
This will generate approximately $17 million of cash savings annually beginning in 2022.
Now as it pertains to our debt maturities, our scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of this year and 2022 are $21 million and $2.2 billion.
But as we sit today, there are guests sailing on 29 of our 60 ships in the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Alaska, Iceland, and the Galapagos.
As a result, we anticipate having about 65% of our fleet in service at the end of the third quarter and approximately 80% of the fleet back in operation by the end of the year.
And we received about 50% more bookings in Q2 than during the previous three months, with trends improving one month to the next.
By June, we were receiving about 90% more bookings each week when compared to Q1, with bookings for 2022 practically back to 2019 levels.
This is evident in our fleet where several of our ships are now sailing with more than 50% load factors.
We have been dreaming of this moment for more than 16 months, and it's finally here.
