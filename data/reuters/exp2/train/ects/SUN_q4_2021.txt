Before I walk you through our 2021 full year results and accomplishments, I'd like to make a few comments on a recently announced acquisition of the 23,000 barrels a day transmitter facility in Huntington, Indiana.
Now, shifting over to our full year 2021 results and accomplishments, we recorded adjusted even of $754 million, above the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range and up 2% from 2020.
Distributable cash flow as adjusted was $542 million, up 5% versus the prior year.
We improved our already strong distribution coverage ratio to 1.6 times, up from 1.5 times in 2020 and 1.3 times in 2019.
Our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong with leverage at the end of the year, 4.17 times and availability on our credit facility of approximately $930 million.
Finally, our strong financial position allowed us to take advantage of a diversified set of growth opportunities in 2021, including the acquisition of 9 refined products terminals and the construction of a greenfield terminal in Brownsville terminal.
In December, we provided guidance for 2022 adjusted EBITDA of between $770 million $810 million.
Underpinning this guidance are the following assumption, fuel volumes in a range of 7.7 billion to 8.1 billion gallons.
Annual fuel margin between $10.5 and $11.5 per gallon.
Total operating expenses between $490 million and $500 million.
Maintenance capital of $50 million, in growth capital of approximately $150 million.
We will be financially disciplined with the target coverage ratio of at least 1.4 times and a target leverage ratio of 4.0 times.
Volumes for the quarter were up 3% from last year.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong margins of $0.12 per gallon.
There was over a $0.50 per gallon spread from low to high during the quarter.
Continuing with the subject of capital, the $150 million growth capex guidance provided in December will be primarily focused on expanding the fuel distribution business with some capital spent on our midstream operations.
In addition, we're thrilled to announce another meaningful expansion to our midstream portfolio with a deal to acquire a 23,000 barrels per day mixed processing and terminal facility in Huntington, Indiana, for $190 million.
The facility is the largest transmix plant in North America and has onsite product storage of approximately 750,000 barrels.
Our LTM coverage ratio is now around 1.6 times, while our leverage ratio continues to decrease toward our 4 times target.
