In the second quarter, GAAP net income was $449 million.
However, GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.42 due to the GAAP accounting treatment required for the transaction entered into with Samsung Display.
As part of the agreement, Samsung converted preferred stock into common stock, and Corning immediately repurchased 35 million shares of that common stock from Samsung.
Excluding this, U.S. GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.52.
Versus second-quarter 2020, sales grew 35% to $3.5 billion.
earnings per share grew 112% to $0.53 on the higher sales and expanding margins.
Free cash grew 65% to $471 million with first-half cash generation of $843 million.
Each of our five segments grew sales by a double-digit percentage year over year, ranging from 16% for specialty materials to 80% for environmental technologies.
Now, of course, 2020 was an easy compare so I think it's worth noting that even versus second quarter of 2019, we grew total company sales and earnings per share 17% and 18%, respectively.
About $200 million is from Hemlock and more than $300 million is organic growth with about 70% of that coming from success of our more Corning content strategy and outperforming the competition.
The other 30% of organic growth is from rising with the market.
For example, over the past few years, we have created new-to-the-world products including ceramic shield, tougher Gorilla Glasses, auto-grade glass, Valor drug packaging, Gen 10.5 display glass, innovative passive optical solutions that are dramatically increasing the ease and cost efficiency of network deployments.
We knew that BOE would need glass for its Gen 10.5 panels, that car companies would need gasoline particulate filters to meet new regulations, that bio tech companies would need high density cell culture to support gene therapy, and that smartphone OEMs would need increasingly durable, scratch-resistant cover glass as they design thinner phones and bigger cameras.
Today the build projects we undertook from 2016 to 2019 are collectively delivering return on invested capital above 20%.
They've helped us increase our sales run rate from $10 billion in 2015 and 2016 to our current run rate of $14 billion, and they've help us improve total company ROIC by three percentage points.
In the quarter, consistent with our strategy to a customer commitments and support of build initiatives, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its advanced manufacturing fund to help expand our manufacturing capacity in the United States and to support our R&D.

We're uniquely suited to address these trends and we're pursuing $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, precision glass products, and auto glass solutions.
Our solutions are enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai's new electric crossover, the IONIQ 5.
Additionally a new generation of gasoline particulate filters is helping us on our way to surpassing $500 million in annual GPF sales, well ahead of our original timeframe.
We worked with Thermo Fisher and OPTIMA Pharma to create solutions that increase [Inaudible] filling speed by nearly 70%, thereby alleviating a critical bottleneck in the medical supply chain.
Meanwhile the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity although the market for large size keys is expected and projected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2024.
And Gen 10.5 provides the most economical approach for larger sets.
We recently hosted the official opening ceremony for our Gen 10.5 facility in the city of Wuhan.
This site is co-located with a large BOE plant, allowing Corning to deliver Gen 10.5 glass substrates more efficiently to our customer for its production of large-sized display panels.
Gen 10.5 provides strong economics for our shareholders while creating options to use earlier generation fusion tanks for new applications such as automotive and cover glass.
To illustrate, remember that we launched our Gorilla Glass business back in 2007 by repurposing some of our existing fusion assets.
Broadband usage for June was up 33% versus pre-pandemic levels, and up 10% versus June 2020, which was a peak quarantine period.

I'll focus on televisions since they represent about 70% of the glass market.
Since LCD TV has emerged as mainstream technology in 2004, LCD's television units have only three times and never two years in a row an annual glass demand has never declined.
Assess 2014 television set for units are typically range bound between 225 million and 235 million while average screen size grows about an inch and a half a year.
In 2020, global TV units increased 4% above the trend line to about 242 million.
