MPC EBT is up 29%.
Operating asset NOI is higher by 1% even with lingering impacts from the pandemic.
And this was all accomplished while reducing our G&A cost by 30%.
Condo sales in Ward Village accelerated despite a shrinking supply of available units under construction and the Seaport saw steady improvements from the return of the concert series at Pier 17 and the growing popularity of our unique restaurants.
We expect these results to grow stronger especially with the recent addition of Douglas Ranch our latest MPC spanning 37000 acres in Phoenix West Valley.
In October we announced our $600 million all-cash acquisition of this fully entitled shovel-ready MPC which further adds to our depth of opportunities.
By strategically redeploying the net proceeds from our noncore asset dispositions we now have the ability to transform this blank canvas into a leading community focused on sustainability and technology a community that is entitled for 100000 homes 300000 residents and 55 million square feet of commercial development.
As such we are pleased to announce our recent Board-approved share buyback program amounting to $250 million.
During the third quarter our MPCs recorded earnings before taxes of $54.1 million a 48% increase compared to last year largely driven by the robust superpad sales activity in Summerlin as well as the strong performance of our Summit joint venture.
So far in 2021 there have been 2163 new homes sold in our MPCs a 6% increase over last year indicating further demand lies ahead.
As such we are raising our full year 2021 MPC EBT guidance by $60 million at the midpoint to a range of $275 million to $285 million primarily due to stronger-than-expected superpad sales in Summerlin.
Speaking of Summerlin this MPC drove a substantial portion of the positive results for the quarter selling 47 acres mostly made up of superpads.
This MPC generated $45.6 million in EBT a staggering 130% increase compared to the prior year period.
Additionally year-to-date new home sales have eclipsed over 1200 units and are 20% higher over the same period in 2020 which if you recall was one of the strongest years in Summerlin's history.
Another significant driver to Summerlin's results has been our joint venture at the Summit our exclusive 550-acre community in Summerlin.
The total earnings from our share of equity during the quarter totaled $8.3 million driving year-to-date earnings to $54.6 million versus only $4.4 million during the first nine months of 2020.
Lastly in the Woodlands Hills despite lower quarterly land sales due to the similar impacts experienced in Bridgeland the residential price per acre grew 18% over the prior year period to $353000 while new home sales were up 15% which points to future growth ahead as we accelerate activity across this MPC.
We saw heightened activity throughout the quarter as events and concerts at Pier 17 helped draw in spectators.
During the quarter NOI improved 43% compared to the same period in 2020 indicating the return to normalcy is near.
In July we launched our 11-week summer concert series on the Pier 17 rooftop.
Of the 30 concerts hosted 20 were fully sold out.
The turnout for these contracts proved to be very strong with approximately 74000 guests in attendance representing 90% of our available ticket inventory.
In addition to concerts we hosted several other major events including the SPs in July and the world tour for the Fujis who debuted at Pier 17 for their first show together in 15 years.
As a result our restaurant saw their average monthly sales increased 65% versus last quarter.
For the third quarter we reported $60.6 million of NOI.
When you layer in the activity from our three hotels that were sold in September this segment generated $62.9 million.
These assets generated $16.1 million of NOI during the third quarter the highest level since the first quarter of 2019.
For the third quarter we collected 83% of our retail rents with Summerlin leading the charge for the highest collections in our portfolio.
In fact Ward was the largest contributor to the sequential increase in retail NOI partly as a result of a onetime payment of deferred rent of approximately $1.4 million.
At the Las Vegas Ballpark we were able to host the remainder of the aviator season at 100% capacity.
This resulted in $5.4 million of NOI a 74% increase over the last quarter where the beginning of the season was limited to 50% capacity to comply with COVID-19 protocols.
This is a stark comparison to the same period in 2020 where the ballpark lost nearly $1 million as the season was canceled entirely due to the pandemic.
Our multifamily assets produced $9.2 million of NOI during the third quarter a 24% sequential increase almost exclusively attributable to strong leasing momentum at our most recent developments.
And during the third quarter these new developments made up 2/3 of the increase in sequential NOI growth.
For the third quarter we generated $27.8 million in NOI a 6% increase sequentially and a 17% increase compared to the same period last year.
The bulk of this increase was driven by the roll-off of free rent at select assets including 6100 Merriweather our latest office building in Downtown Columbia.
With that we are pleased to announce the launch of two medical facilities spanning 106000 square feet throughout Downtown Columbia and the Woodlands.
Encompassing approximately 86000 square feet we have already secured an anchor tenant for roughly 20% of the entire space.
In The Woodlands we will launch development on a 20000 square foot build-to-suit medical office building for Memorial Hermann.
These 263 homes will span a combined 328000 square feet and offer a unique hybrid between single-family homes for sale and multifamily for rent adding yet another new product to our operating asset portfolio.
In total these three projects represent over 430000 square feet and $114 million of development as we continue to put our capital to work and enhance our stream of recurring income.
The launch of the Tin Building has been highly anticipated and our team has been working in close partnership with the Jean Georges team to prepare for the grand opening of this 53000 square foot food hall in the first half of 2022.
Lastly we continue to make great strides through New York City's ULURP process to obtain the necessary approvals for the development of a 26-story mixed-use building at 250 Water Street.
Across our three recent towers 'A'ali'i Koula and Victoria Place we were 90% presold as of the end of the quarter with Koula and Victoria Place still under construction.
And as of the end of October we have already contracted 64% of the total units.
The sales activity across these four towers just in the third quarter translates to 316 contracted units secured by hard deposits during a period of time when travel to the island of Oahu was discouraged surrounding Delta variant concerns.
As of November two we closed on 495 units totaling $332 million in net revenue revenue that will be recognized on our fourth quarter income statement and will contribute meaningly to our bottom line.
In summary our MPCs produced $54.1 million of earnings before tax or EBT during the third quarter a 22% decrease compared to the last quarter and a 48% increase compared to the prior year period.
Our operating assets recorded a $62.9 million of NOI when including the contribution from the three Woodlands-based hotels which represented a 9% increase compared to the last quarter and a 65% increase compared to the prior year period.
At Ward Village we contracted 316 condo units which were made up of 61 units from our three towers under construction and 255 units at the park which launched presales during the quarter.
Combined sales at 'A'ali'i Koula and Victoria Place were up 36% compared to the prior quarter and increased 154% compared to the prior year period.
Finally at the Seaport we recorded a $3.6 million loss in NOI resulting in a 19% improvement over the last quarter and a 43% improvement compared to the prior year period.
We reported net income of $4.1 million or $0.07 per diluted share compared to net income of $139.7 million or $2.51 per diluted share in the prior year period.
The decrease in net income from the prior year was attributed to a onetime noncash gain of $267.5 million for the third quarter of 2020 which was related to the deconsolidation of our 110 North Wacker office tower in Chicago.
Our previous guidance range for 2021 was $210 million to $230 million.
We are now raising our guidance by $60 million at the midpoint thus revising our range to $275 million to $285 million as we are expecting a strong end to the year.
Given the recovery we are experiencing in our operating assets we are raising our full year NOI guidance by $5 million to a range of $200 million to $210 million.
We are raising this segment's guidance despite the fact that we will not receive any hospitality-related NOI during the fourth quarter as we just sold our Woodlands hotels in September for $252 million.
The sale of these assets generated $120 million of net proceeds and brings our total net proceeds from noncore asset sales to $376 million since the announcement of our strategic transformation plan in late 2019.
We are also revising our full year condo profit guidance at Ward Village by $7.5 million at the midpoint.
Our previous guidance range for 2021 was $100 million to $125 million.
With elevated condo sales following the completion of 'A'ali'i in October we are expecting condo profits to range between $115 million to $125 million.
Please note that this target excludes the $20 million repair cost incurred at Waiea during the first quarter which we fully expect to be reimbursed for.
Lastly we remain on track to meet our previously disclosed G&A guidance of $80 million to $85 million for 2021.
We ended the third quarter with $1 billion of cash on hand leaving us plenty of runway to execute on the recent capital initiatives we discussed earlier.
A couple of our recent financings include two construction loans for our latest project in Downtown Summerlin a $75 million loan for our 1700 Pavilion office development and a $59.5 million loan for our Tanager Echo multifamily development.
In addition we refinanced The Woodlands and Bridgeland credit facility into a new $275 million loan secured by Bridgeland notes receivables and land to support future horizontal development.
Lastly subsequent to quarter end we closed on a $250 million loan for 1201 Lake Robbins resulting in net proceeds of $248 million which helps elevate our overall cash position.
We announced the launch of three new development projects and we announced the $250 million share buyback.
