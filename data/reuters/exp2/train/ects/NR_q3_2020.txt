As we touched on last quarter, our market share in U.S. land has meaningfully expanded in recent months and I'm pleased to highlight that our share has remained above [Phonetic] 20% mark, throughout the third quarter, achieving a record level for Newpark.
In the Gulf of Mexico, the quarter is impacted by the repeated weather-related disruptions which led to revenues declining by nearly 50% to $7 million.

International revenues also declined $21 million or 45% year-over-year with declines seen across substantially all markets.
Despite realizing a meaningful impact from our cost actions, the third quarter operating loss was impacted by the $7 million sequential decline in revenues, cost inefficiencies driven by the unplanned activity interruptions in the Gulf of Mexico and EMEA region, the start-up of cleaning products packaging as well as ongoing efforts to drawdown excess inventories.
Turning to the Mats business, total segment revenues increased 5% sequentially to $29 million in the third quarter, driven by improvement in rental and services as well as product sales.

As of the end of the third quarter, the weighted average cash borrowing rate on our outstanding debt was approximately 3%.
The third quarter benefit from income taxes was $4.8 million, which reflects a 17% effective rate for the third quarter and 15% rate for the first nine months of 2020.

For the third quarter, cash provided by operating activities was $15 million which included a $29 million net reduction in working capital.

In the Mats segment, with the benefit of the hurricane-driven demand in the U.S. utility sector to start the fourth quarter, ongoing strength from our UK business along with the pickup in customer bidding and planning activity, we expect Q4 rental and service revenues to improve by roughly 10% from Q3.
With regards to cash flows, we have made solid progress in monetizing working capital over the past two quarters and see additional opportunities ahead with over $200 million of net working capital remaining on our books.
As illustrated by our actions over the past two quarters, we are taking prudent steps to maintain positive cash flow with a particular focus on the remaining $67 million convertible note maturity at the end of next year.
It's also worth noting that with our 30-day average share price recently falling below the NYSE's $1 listing requirement, we expect to receive notification from the NYSE regarding this non-compliance.

For examples of this, you need to look no further than our flagship products, including our fully [Indecipherable] DURA-BASE matting system which has been in the market for over 20 years and competes primarily with old-growth timber mats or our evolution water-based drilling fluid system launched in 2010, which provides customers with a number of environmental benefits over traditional diesel fuel-based products.
