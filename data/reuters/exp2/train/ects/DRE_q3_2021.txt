For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our 10-K or 10-Q that we have on file with the SEC and the company's other SEC filings.
We now have had three successive quarters of demand at or near all-time records, and projected market level rent growth has risen from the 10% range to the mid-teens percent nationally and in some submarkets as high as 35%.
During the quarter, we began roughly $350 million of new developments with expected strong value creation and IRRs, and we raised our full year guidance on starts once again.
The margins on our development pipeline are now over 60%, and our core portfolio achieved record rent growth of 22% on a cash basis from second-generation leasing activity.
These quarterly results and our improved outlook for the balance of the year resulted in our raising key components of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to be at 13.8% and growth in AFFO per share of 11.6%.
Based on these results and our optimism about the balance of the year, we have raised the dividend by almost 10%.
Industrial net absorption registered 121 million square feet, which is only one million square feet less than the all-time record.
This was more than enough to offset the new supply as completions came in at about 79 million square feet.
This positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 3.6%, setting yet another record low.
The strong fundamentals increased nationwide asking rents during the third quarter by 10% compared to the previous year.
CBRE now projects demand for the full year in the mid-300 million-square-foot range and likely to break the all-time 2016 record of 327 million square feet.
Completions for the year are projected to be about 270 million square feet.
National asking rents for the full year are expected to be in the mid-teens with some markets like Northern New Jersey and Southern California likely to see increases of 30% to 35%.
The reaction to supply chain bottlenecks continues to be in the early stages of a long-term boom for our sector, with CBRE reaffirming roughly 1.2 billion square feet of projected aggregate demand over the next five years.
Demand by occupier type remains broad-based with e-commerce and logistics services companies continuing to make up roughly 60% of our activity, with the e-commerce contribution about 10% lower compared to 2020 and the 3PL contribution about 10% higher than this time last year.
It is also noteworthy that Amazon's share of demand this year is about 10% of overall total demand compared to 18% of demand in 2020.
We executed a very strong quarter by signing 9.5 million square feet of leases.
The strong lease activity for the quarter resulted in continued growth in rents within our portfolio as we reported 35% on a GAAP basis and 22% cash, notably, with only 25% of our transactions occurring in coastal Tier one markets.
We now project our mark-to-market on a GAAP basis within our portfolio to be 28%.
We started $349 million of new development totaling two million square feet that consisted of six speculative projects and two build-to-suits in the quarter.
80% of this volume was in our coastal Tier one markets.
Our team has continued to lease our speculative projects successfully as evidenced by stabilizing seven new developments during the quarter and increasing the development pipeline to 60% leased.
To put our track record of leasing speculative projects in context, the $897 million of projects that we placed in service this year through September 30 increased from 39% leased when the construction started to 90% leased when they were placed in service.
At quarter end, we totaled $1.1 billion with 86% of this allocated to Tier one markets and 60% preleased.
We now expect value creation from this pipeline of over 60%, which is primarily due to rapid appreciation of rents and land.
We expect the lead percent of our total NOI to trend toward 25% by the end of 2022.
The outlook for new starts is strong and is reflected in our revised guidance of our midpoint being up $175 million.
On a longer-term basis, we either own or control land, primarily in coastal infill markets that can support roughly $1 billion of annual starts over the next four years if the supply/demand picture remains robust, which we believe it will.
It is also important to note the market value of the land we own is about 2 times our book basis, and on average, we've only owned this land for about two years.
For the quarter, disposition proceeds totaled $738 million, including outright sales and contributions to joint ventures.
The pricing in aggregate was at an in-place cap rate of 4.8%, which was inflated a bit by a high 5% cap rate for the St. Louis portfolio in which pricing was impacted by expected rent roll-downs on looming tax abatement expirations.
We acquired one facility in the third quarter totaling $24 million, a 63,000-square-foot facility in the San Gabriel Valley submarket of Southern California.
This third quarter activity has further shifted the geographic position of our portfolio on an NOI basis to approximately 40% in the coastal Tier one market.
Let me also note that just after quarter end in very early October, we closed on the sale of a 517,000-square-foot Amazon facility in Columbus, Ohio.
Core FFO for the quarter was $0.46 per share, which represents 15% growth over the $0.40 per share from the third quarter of 2020.
AFFO totaled $151 million for the quarter compared to $135 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the three and nine months ended 2021 compared to the same periods of 2020 was 3.8% and 5.3%, respectively.
The growth in the same-property NOI for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 was mainly due to rent growth, partially offset by an 80 basis point decrease in occupancy in our same-property portfolio due to an extremely high occupancy comp of 98.6 in 2020.
We had $273 million of sale proceeds in 1031 escrow accounts at the end of the quarter that will be used to fund near-term building and land acquisitions.
As a result of our continued strong operating results, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 in a range of $1.71 to $1.75 per share compared to the previous range of $1.69 to $1.73 per share.
The $1.73 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents a nearly 14% increase over 2020.
For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we have increased our guidance to a range of 5% to 5.4% from the previous range of 4.75% to 5.25%.
Based on these prospects, our revised guidance for development starts is between $1.3 billion and $1.45 billion compared to the previous range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.
We started the year with very solid growth expectations and have exceeded every one of them, resulting in a nearly 14% growth in core FFO at the revised midpoint.
Our shareholders should be very pleased with our dividend increase of $0.025 per share.
This 9.8% increase marks our seventh straight year of annual dividend increases, representing a growth of over 65% over that period.
These drivers, combined with the undersupply of new available warehouse product, will allow us to maintain our high occupancy rates and rent growth while creating substantial profit margins on our $1 billion-plus development pipeline.
The net result of these factors is our belief we can continue to grow earnings at approximately 10% pace for the foreseeable future.
