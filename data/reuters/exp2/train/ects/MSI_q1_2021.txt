In fixed video, which makes up approximately 70% of the total video security revenue, our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control and NDAA-compliant manufacturing is differentiating us from our competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market.
Additionally, during the quarter, we announced two new offerings, the integration of our V300 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, which allow us to leverage our market-leading LMR installed base and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, which offers every police agency in the U.S. with affordable access to a video solution that's fully integrated with our command central software suite.
Today, almost half our revenue is generated from these higher growth areas, up from 20% five years ago, and our addressable market has tripled over that same period of time.
