Second quarter FFO per share as adjusted for comparability of $0.58 exceeded the high end of guidance by a $0.01.
Additionally, NOI from real estate operations in the quarter was up 8% and AFFO increased 17% from a year ago.
Through the second quarter, we completed total leasing of 1.7 million square feet, which included 815,000 square feet of renewals, 205,000 square feet of vacancy leasing and 641,000 square feet of development leasing.
So far in the third quarter we've executed 53,000 square feet of development leasing and we are in advanced negotiations on another 250,000 square feet that should close this quarter.
Based on this activity we're highly confident we will achieve our 1 million square foot growth for the year.
Regarding our large renewal at DC-6, we have not finalized the lease yet.
During the quarter, we placed 197,000 square feet of development projects in the service including Project EL, 107,000 square foot specialized facility we built for a defense contractor in San Antonio.
We expect to deliver NoVA C in 610 Guardian Way earlier than planned, which combined with Project EL are adding nearly $0.03 to this year's FFO per share.
The $2.26 midpoint of updated 2021 guidance is $0.07 above our original midpoint and 6.6% higher than 2020 results.
In the second quarter, we leased 1.4 million square feet including 661,000 square feet of renewals for a very strong retention rate of 89%.
Cash rents on renewals rolled up 0.1% and annual escalations averaged 2.6%.
For the 6-month period, we completed 815,000 square feet of renewal leasing with a 78% retention rate and average lease term of 4.3 years and cash rents rolling down 0.2%.
Late in the quarter, we learned that a tenant at Redstone Gateway did not win the recompete of a large contract and at the end of the year will vacate RG 1200, a 121,000 square feet building.
This will be our first opportunity in 10 years to demonstrate the strength of demand for second-generation space at the park.
In terms of vacancy leasing, we completed 111,000 square feet in the quarter, representing 10% of our available space at the beginning of the period.
For the first half of the year, we completed 205,000 square feet of vacancy leasing.
Our leasing activity ratio is 105%, the highest level since well before the pandemic demonstrating continued growth in demand across our portfolio.
Regarding development leasing, second quarter achievement was a robust 630,000 square feet and consisted of a 265,000 square foot data center shell in Northern Virginia for our cloud computing customer and 179,000 square feet at Redstone Gateway in the form of two major pre-leases with KBRwyle.
We also executed a 183,000 square foot build-to-suit at the National Business Park.
The tenant is a Fortune 100 company and an important defense contractor that provides secure infrastructure, artificial intelligence and cloud computing services to U.S. Defense and Intelligence agencies.
So far in the third quarter we have executed a 53,000 square foot lease in 8000 Rideout Road with i3, a defense contractor that specializes in software engineering, systems integration and IT.
As a result, that project is now 73% leased and we are in advanced negotiations on leases that will stabilize the building.
Lastly, we are in advanced negotiations with a defense contractor for a two-building campus at Redstone Gateway for 250,000 square feet.
These leases would bring our total development leasing for the year to 950,000 square feet.
Based on the 1.8 million square feet of opportunities in our development leasing pipeline, we are highly confident we will meet our 2021 development leasing goal.
Second quarter FFO per share as adjusted for comparability of $0.58 exceeded the high end of guidance by $0.01 driven primarily by stronger same property results.
Lower operating costs due to effective expense management and the timing of R&M projects boosted second quarter same property cash NOI by nearly $0.02 above our second quarter forecast.
We expect to complete these R&M projects in the third and fourth quarters, which will impact quarterly same property cash NOI and FFO per share as shown on page 18 of the results deck.
We now expect same property cash NOI for the year to either be flat or increase as much as 1%, which at the midpoint is a 150 basis point increase relative to our original guidance.
We are maintaining our full year occupancy guidance of 90% to 92%, which continues to incorporate the negative impact of joint venturing fully occupied wholly owned datacenter shells to raise equity as well as the unexpected vacancy of the 121,000 square foot contractor building at Redstone Gateway in December.
In early June, we sold two data center shells to a new 90%/10% joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate, which generated proceeds of $107 million.
The assets were valued at $119 million, which represented a 48% profit and demonstrated the value we create through development.
Including three properties under development, we wholly own 10 data center shells that we estimate represent more than $750 million of equity value we can monetize to fund the equity component of future development.
Lastly, and for reasons already discussed, we are increasing our full year guidance from a previously elevated range of $2.19 to $2.25 to a new range of $2.24 to $2.28.
Our updated guidance range implies 5.7% to 7.5% growth over 2020 results and 6.6% at the midpoint.
For the third and fourth quarters we are establishing ranges for FFO per share guidance as adjusted for comparability of $0.54 to $0.56 and $0.56 to $0.58 respectively.
The $0.55 midpoint in the third quarter reflects a full quarter's dilution from the two data center shells we joint ventured in June and executing additional R&M projects.
