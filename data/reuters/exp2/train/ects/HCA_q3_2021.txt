For the quarter, COVID patients accounted for 13% of total admissions.
This level compares to 3% in the second quarter, 10% in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter of last year.
Our teams provided record levels of inpatient care during the quarter, which drove revenue growth of 15% as compared to the prior year.
Inpatient revenue grew 18% and outpatient revenue grew 11%.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at over 21%.
Diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of facilities, increased to $4.57, which is a notable increase over the prior year, even considering that last year's third quarter included the $1.72 per share effect of the reversal of the government stimulus income, which as you may recall, resulted from our decision to return or repay early approximately $6 billion of governmental assistance we received from the CARES Act.
Overall, we believe demand will return to historical trends for us, with volumes growing across most categories in the 2% to 3% zone.
We estimate that approximately 3% to 5% of our total admissions will be COVID-related.
Our cash flow from operations was $2.28 billion as compared to $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2020.
In the prior year, we had received approximately $300 million of stimulus income and deferred approximately $200 million of payroll taxes.
Capital spending for the quarter was $889 million.
And we have approximately $3.9 billion of approved capital in the pipeline that is scheduled to come online between now and the end of 2023.
We completed just over $2.3 billion of share repurchases during the quarter.
We have approximately $2.7 billion remaining on our authorization.
And we anticipate completing approximately $8 billion of share repurchases for full-year 2021.
Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.55 times at the end of the third quarter, which is the lowest it has been in over 15 years.
We had approximately $5.9 billion of available liquidity at the end of the quarter.
Also during the quarter, we recorded about $1 billion gain on sale of facilities related to the sale of four hospitals in Georgia and other healthcare entity investments.
We anticipate we will generate approximately $1.5 billion of after-tax proceeds from our announced divestitures.
As I conclude my remarks, I think it's important to reflect on the financial condition of the company as we have navigated the past 20 months of this pandemic.
