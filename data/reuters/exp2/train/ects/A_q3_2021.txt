In addition, we are on track to deliver roughly $100 million in COVID-related revenue in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year.
We expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share to a range of $4.28 to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year.
This translates the fourth quarter revenue ranging from $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion.
This represents reported growth of 10% to 12% and core growth of 8.5% to 10% on top of the 6% growth in Q4 of last year when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns.
So, our core growth excluding COVID would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%.
We are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum, but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $1.15 and $1.18 with growth of 17% to 20%.
