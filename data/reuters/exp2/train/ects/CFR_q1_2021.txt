In general, energy loans continued to decline as a percentage of our portfolio falling to 7.5% of our non-PPP portfolio at the end of the first quarter.

Now let me share with you where we stand with the expansion as of March for the 22 locations we had opened at that time and it excludes PPP loans.
Our numbers of new households were 144% of target and represent over 8,700 new individuals and businesses.
Our loan volumes were 212% of target and represented $263 million in outstandings.
About 85% represent commercial credits with about 15% consumer.
They represent just under half C&I loans, about 1/4 investor real estate, 15% consumer and around 10% nonprofit in public finance.
Finally, with only three loans over $10 million, over 80% are core loans.
At $343 million, they represent 114% of target.
We've seen increasing momentum over the last year when we were about 68% of our target.
And that's why I'm happy to share that we will be taking the lessons and skills we've learned in the Houston market to a very similar opportunity we have before us in Dallas early next year with 25 new locations over a 30-month period.
To date, we've taken in about 12,400 new loan applications in the second round of PPP with over $1.3 billion funded.
Combined with our total from the first round last year, we funded more than 31,000 loans or $4.6 billion, just amazing.
We've invited all of the round one borrowers to apply for forgiveness, and we've submitted 70% of those loan balances to the SBA, and we've received forgiveness on about 50% already.
We're excited to announce that on April 15, we've launched a new feature for our consumer customers called $100 overdraft grace.
Our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was 2.72%, down 10 basis points from the 2.82% reported last quarter.
Interest-bearing deposits at the Fed earning 10 basis points averaged $9.9 billion or 25% of our earning assets in the first quarter, up from $7.7 billion or 20% of earning assets in the prior quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans, our net interest margin percentage would have been 2.59% in the first quarter, down from an adjusted 2.75% for the fourth quarter.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the first quarter was 3.87%, up 13 basis points from the previous quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been 3.77%, basically flat with the prior quarter.
Average loan volumes in the first quarter of 17.7 billion were down 260 million from the fourth quarter average of 17.9 billion.
Excluding PPP loans, average loans in the first quarter were down about 184 million, or 1.2% from the fourth quarter, with about three quarters of that decrease related to energy loans.
To add some additional color on our PPP loans, as Phil mentioned, we funded over 1.3 billion of round two PPP loans during the first quarter.
This was offset by approximately 580 million and forgiveness payments during the quarter on round one loan, bringing our total round one forgiveness payments to approximately 1.4 billion.
At the end of the first quarter we had approximately 73 million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized with about one third of this related to round one loans.
As a result, we currently expect about 90% of the remaining net defer fees to be recognized this year.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged 12.2 billion during the first quarter, down about 335 million from the fourth quarter average of 12.6 billion.
The taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was 3.41% in the first quarter, flat with the fourth quarter.
The yield on the taxable portfolio, which averaged 4 billion was 2.06% down 6 basis points from the fourth quarter as a result of higher premium amortization associated with our agency mortgage backed security given faster prepayment speed, and to a lesser extent, lower yields associated with recent purchases.
Our municipal portfolio averaged about 8.2 billion during the first quarter, down 154 million from the fourth quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of 4.09% flat with the prior quarter.
At the end of the first quarter 78% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded, or PSF insured.
Investment purchases during the first quarter were approximately 500 million and consistent about 200 million each in treasuries and mortgage backed securities respectively with the remainder being municipal.
Our current projections only assumed that we make investment purchases of about 1.4 billion for the year, which will help us to offset a portion of our maturities and expected prepayments and calls.
Regarding non-interest expense looking at the full year 2021, we currently expect an annual expense growth of something around the 3.5% to 4% range from our 2020 total reported non-interest expenses.
We currently believe that the current mean of analysts' estimates of $5.42 is too low.
