Our occupation is currently 97%, leasing activity is strong, and turnover remains low.
Same-property revenue growth was 4.1% for the quarter and was positive in all markets, both year-over-year and sequentially.
We have remarkable growth in Phoenix and Tampa both at 9.1%, Southeast Florida at 8.6%, Atlanta at 5.7% and Raleigh at 4.6%.
We thought the April new lease and renewal numbers we reported on last quarter's call were pretty good at nearly 5%.
For the second quarter of '21, signed new leases were 9.3% and renewals were 6.7% for a blended rate of 8%.
For leases which were signed earlier and became effective during the end -- during the second quarter, new lease growth was 5.4% with renewals at 4% for a blended rate of 4.7%.
July 2021 looks to be one of the best months we've ever had with new signed -- signed new leases trending at 18.7%, renewals at 10.5% and a blended rate of 14.6%.
Renewal offers for August and September were sent out with an average increase of around 11%.
Occupancy has also continued to improve, going from 96% in the first quarter this year to 96.9% in the second quarter and is currently at 97.1% for July.
Net turnover ticked up slightly in the second quarter to 45% versus 41% last year due to the aggressive pricing increases we instituted, but it remains well below long-term historical levels.
Move-outs to home purchases also ticked up slightly from 16.9% in the first quarter this year to 17.7% in the second quarter, which reflects normal seasonal patterns in our markets.
So despite the constant headlines regarding increased number of single-family home sales, it really has not had an effect on our portfolio performance as the move-outs to purchase homes are still slightly below our long-term average of about 18%.
Improving the lives of our team and customers has in turn improved the lives of shareholders, including the approximately 500 Camden employees who participated in the employee share purchase plan this year.
During the second quarter of 2021, as previously mentioned, we entered the Nashville market with a $186 million purchase of Camden Music Row, a recently constructed, 430-unit, 18-story community and the $105 million purchase of Camden Franklin Park, a recently constructed 328-unit, 5-story community.
Both assets were purchased at just under a 4% yield.
Also, during the quarter, we stabilized both Camden RiNo, a 233-unit $7 million new development in Denver, generating an approximate 6% yield in Camden Cypress Creek II, a 234-unit joint venture in Houston, Texas, generating an approximate 7.75% yield.
Additionally, during the quarter, we began leasing at Camden Hillcrest, a 132-unit, $95 million new development in San Diego.
On the financing side, during the quarter, we issued approximately $360 million of shares under our existing ATM program.
In the quarter, we collected 98.7% of our scheduled rents with only 1.3% delinquent.
For multifamily residents, we have currently reserved $11 million as uncollectible revenue against a receivable of $12 million.
Last night, we reported funds from operations for the second quarter of 2021 of $131.2 million or $1.28 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.03 per share.
This $0.03 per share outperformance for the second quarter resulted primarily from approximately $0.03 in higher same-store NOI, resulting from $0.025 of higher revenue, driven by higher rental rates, higher occupancy and lower bad debt and $0.05 of lower operating expenses driven by a combination of lower water expense and lower salaries due to open positions on site and approximately $0.02 in better-than-anticipated results from our non-same-store and development communities.
This $0.05 aggregate outperformance was partially offset by $0.01 of higher overhead costs, primarily associated with our employee stock purchase plan, combined with a $0.01 impact from our higher share count resulting from our recent ATM activity.
Taking into consideration the previously mentioned significant improvement in new leases, renewals and occupancy, and our resulting expectations for the remainder of the year, we have increased the midpoint of our full year revenue growth from 1.6% to 3.75%.
Additionally, as a result of our slightly better-than-expected second quarter same-store expense performance and our anticipation of the trend continuing throughout the year, we decreased the midpoint of our full year expense growth from 3.9% to 3.75%.
The result of both of these changes is a 350 basis point increase to the midpoint of our 2021 same-store NOI guidance from 0.25% to 3.75%.
Our 3.75% same-store revenue growth assumptions are based upon occupancy averaging approximately 97% for the remainder of the year, with the blend of new lease and renewals averaging approximately 11%.
Last night, we also increased the midpoint of our full year 2021 FFO guidance by $0.18 per share.
Our new 2021 FFO guidance is $5.17 to $5.37 with a midpoint of $5.27 per share.
This $0.18 per share increase results from our anticipated 350 basis points or $0.21 increase in 2021 same-store operating results, $0.03 of this increase occurred in the second quarter, with the remainder anticipated over the third and fourth quarters and an approximate $0.06 increase from our non-same-store and development communities.
This $0.27 aggregate increase in FFO is partially offset by an approximate $0.09 impact from our second quarter ATM activity.
We have made no changes to our full year guidance of $450 million of acquisitions and $450 million of dispositions.
We expect FFO per share for the third quarter to be within the range of $1.30 to $1.36.
The midpoint of $1.33 represents a $0.05 per share improvement from the second quarter, which is anticipated to result from a $0.04 per share or approximate 2.5% expected sequential increase in same-store NOI, driven primarily by higher rental rates, partially offset by our normal second to third quarter seasonal increase in utility, repair and maintenance, unit turnover and personnel expenses.
A $0.015 per share increase in NOI from our development communities in lease-up, our other nonsame-store communities and the incremental contributions from our joint venture communities.
And a $0.02 per share increase in FFO resulting from the full quarter contributions of our recent acquisitions.
This aggregate $0.075 increase is partially offset by $0.025 incremental impact from our second quarter ATM activity.
Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt-to-EBITDA at 4.6 times and a total fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.4 times.
As of today, we have approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $300 million in cash and cash equivalents and no amounts outstanding under our $900 million unsecured facility.
At quarter-end, we had $302 million left to spend over the next three years under our existing development pipeline, and we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2022.
Our current excess cash is invested with various banks, earning approximately 25 basis points.
