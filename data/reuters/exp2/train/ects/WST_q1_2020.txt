On Slide 2 is our safe harbor statement.
We take great pride that for nearly 100 years, we have provided innovative, high-quality products and solutions for the containment and delivery of injectable medicines.
Turning to Slide 4.
As shown on Slide 5, despite today's uncertain environment, I am pleased to report that we had a strong first-quarter performance, and we entered the second quarter well-positioned.
We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales.
GAAP measures are described in slides 13 to 16.
We recorded net sales of $491.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 12.7% and 30 basis points of inorganic growth.
Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 11.8% in the quarter.
High-value products, which make up more than 63% of Proprietary Products sales, grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1.
Moving to Slide 7.
We recorded $167 million in gross profit, $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year, and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90-basis point expansion from the same period last year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter, compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase.
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180-basis point increase from the same period last year.
And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 36% for Q1.
Excluding stock tax benefit, earnings per share grew by approximately 31%.
On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter.
Volume and mix contributed $51.1 million or 11.5 percentage points of growth.
Sales price increases contributed $6.6 million or 1.5 percentage points of growth.
And changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced sales by $9.7 million or a reduction of 2.2 percentage points.
Looking at margin performance, Slide 9 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 34% for Q1 2020, up from 33.1% in Q1 2019.
Proprietary Products' first-quarter gross profit margin of 40.2% was 130 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019.
Production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, contract manufacturing's first-quarter gross profit margin of 14.3% was 30 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2019.
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180-basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products' gross profit expansion.
On Slide 10, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
Operating cash flow was $57.1 million for the first quarter of 2020, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the same period last year, a 20% increase.
Our Q1 2020 capital spending was $32.1 million, $3.3 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
Working capital of $633.1 million at March 31, 2020, was $74 million lower than at December 31, 2019 primarily due to a reduction in our cash and cash equivalents.
Our cash balance of March 31 of $335.3 million was $103.8 million less than our December 2019 balance primarily due to $115 million of expenditures under our share repurchase program.
Slide 11 provides a high-level summary.
Full-year 2020 net sales guidance continues to be in a range of between $1.95 billion and $1.97 billion.
This includes an estimated headwind of $26 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to prior guidance, which forecasted a $15 million headwind.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 8%.
We expect our full-year 2020 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $3.52 to $3.62, compared to prior guidance of $3.45 to $3.55.
Capital expenditure will be in the range of $130 million to $140 million.
Estimated FX headwind on earnings per share has an impact of approximately $0.07 based on current foreign currency exchange rates, compared to prior guidance of $0.04.
The revised guidance also includes a $0.07 earnings per share impact from our first-quarter tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter, strong top-line growth in both Proprietary and contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.
