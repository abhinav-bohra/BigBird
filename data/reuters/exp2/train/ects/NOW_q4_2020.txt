Q4 subscription revenues were $1.184 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth, inclusive of a three-point tailwind from FX.
Q4 subscription billings were very strong at $1.828 billion, representing 41% year-over-year growth and $183 million beat versus the high end of our guidance.
Adjusted growth was 38% year over year.
The outperformance was driven by tremendous execution from our sales team, which resulted in significant net new ACV upside for the quarter as well as $80 million of billings pulled forward from 2021 due to early customer payments.
Excluding these early payments, normalized Q4 billings would have grown 35% year over year, still well ahead of our guidance.
Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $8.9 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth.
And current RPO was approximately $4.4 billion, representing 33% year-over-year growth.
It's this attention to our customers' needs that's driving our best-in-class renewal rate of 99%, demonstrating the stickiness of our business as the Now Platform remains a mission-critical part of our customers' operations.
We closed 89 deals greater than $1 million in ACV in the quarter, with average deal sizes up 18% year over year.
In 2020, we added nearly 700 net new customers, ending the year with almost 6,900 enterprises.
The number of customers paying us $5 million or more in ACV grew over 40% in fiscal 2020.
Q4 operating margin was 22%, a 100-basis-point beat versus our guidance, driven by our strong top line outperformance.
Our free cash flow margin was 45%, up 900 basis points year over year, driven by lower T&E spend and strong collection.
For full year 2020, operating margin was 25%, up 300 basis points year over year.
And free cash flow was 32%, up 400 basis points year over year.
The highly affected industries we outlined early last year, which represented about 20% of our business, continue to see macro headwinds but remained resilient.
Three of our top 20 deals in the quarter were from highly impacted industries, including retail, automotive and energy.
First, as I noted earlier, we saw $80 million in early payments from customers in Q4, which was an approximately 200-basis-point tailwind to full year subscription billings growth in 2020.
These result in a more significant headwind of about 350 basis points for 2021 billings growth.
And as Bill noted, we recently announced our first ever $100 million investment in a racial equity fund to build equitable opportunity for Black communities.
With that in mind, for Q1, we expect subscription revenues between $1.275 billion and $1.28 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including a four-point FX tailwind.
We expect subscription billings between $1.31 billion and $1.315 billion, representing 24% to 25% year-over-year growth.
Excluding the early payments from customers in 2020, our Q1 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 32% year over year.
We expect CRPO growth of 32% year over year, including a five-point FX tailwind.
We expect an operating margin of 25% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter.
For the full-year 2021, we expect subscription revenues between $5.48 billion and $5.5 billion, representing 28% year-over-year growth, including a three-point FX tailwind.
We expect subscription billings between $6.205 billion and $6.225 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth.
Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our 2021 normalized subscription billings growth outlook would be 28% to 29% year-over-year growth.
We expect subscription gross margin of 85%, reflecting some federal and public sector customers moving to our newly launched Azure offering as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements.
We expect an operating margin of 23.5%, representing 150-basis-points expansion off of our pre-COVID 2020 run rate.
I would note that this is also an incremental 50 basis points more than the 100 basis points of expansion we target each year.
Finally, we expect free cash flow margin of 30% and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the year.
We're well on our way to becoming a $10 billion revenue company on the strength of incredible organic innovation.
