We recorded adjusted net income of $8 million in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year adjusted net income to $21.8 million, a $40 million increase compared to 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we released nearly all the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, which has led to approximately $7 million of income tax expense recorded for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2021.
Our potash segment generated $12.5 million and $35.8 million of gross margin in the fourth quarter and full year 2021, respectively.
As we capitalized on rising prices and continued strong demand, fourth-quarter realized pricing for potash increased to $504 per ton, a $120 increase over the third quarter of 2021.
Price increases announced in both the fourth quarter of last year and most recently, in February of 2022, will continue our trend of rising prices through spring as we expect our realized price per ton to increase between $680 and $690 in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of approximately $180 per ton over the fourth quarter of 2021.
Posted prices moved up $30 to $40 per ton in December 2021, and we recently announced another $35 per ton price increase, which is in effect as we speak today.
We expect our first quarter 2022 net realized price for trio will increase between $440 and $450 per ton, and we are currently booking sales for second-quarter shipments at the increased price level, which is approximately $215 more over last year.
As expected, our balance sheet remains in solid shape with $36 million of cash on hand at the very end of the year, a number which has since increased to well over $60 million as of early this week.
We are uniquely able to provide this service at its HB Solar Solution mine, which currently utilizes naturally occurring salt brine and groundwater as permitted injectades, which could potentially turn our approximate 100,000 barrel a day injection system into a revenue stream with the opportunity to actually grow those volumes.
Full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA increased to $67.6 million, more than three times our 2020 EBITDA of approximately $21 million and we expect 2022 will again deliver outstanding year-over-year growth.
Along with the release of the valuation allowance, we recorded approximately $7 million of income tax expense for the full year 2021, all of which was incurred in our fourth-quarter results.
Going forward, we expect a book tax rate of approximately 26%, but with significant state and federal net operating loss carryforwards available to us, we expect to pay minimal cash tax, less than $350,000 annually for at least the next few years.
Additional details regarding our deferred tax assets are included in our 10-K, which we expect to file later today.
We are now coming off nearly 18 months of strong potash demand, which combined with our production shortfalls, has left us with lower inventory levels and less product available for sale than in the first half of 2021.
We expect first half 2022 potash sales of approximately 130,000 to 140,000 tons, split evenly between the first and second quarters.
Although we remain on allocation for our granular and premium trio products, we expect sales volumes to closely follow prior year with 130,000 to 140,000 tons for first half 2022, split evenly between the first and second quarters.
Turning toward 2022 and liquidity, we expect to spend approximately $40 million to $60 million on capital investments in 2022 with $25 million to $35 million of that on sustaining capital.
