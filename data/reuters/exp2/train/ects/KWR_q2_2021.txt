While sales volumes were down 3% from the first quarter, the first quarter was unusually strong as we believe some of our customers were replenishing their inventories.
If we compare our second quarter sales to the fourth quarter of 2020, which was another strong quarter for us, our current quarter sales volumes were up 4%.
You can see from chart 8 where we show our sales volume trends that our sales volumes were up 35% from the second quarter of last year and has sequentially improved at a steady rate since then with the first quarter being unusually high as I mentioned earlier.
Overall, our top line revenue was up 52% from the second quarter of 2020 with all segments showing strong growth since 2020 was particularly hard-hit from COVID.
On a sequential basis sales were up 1% from the first quarter with 3 of our 4 segments showing growth, but our Asia Pacific segment was down 5%.
We are also seeing higher selling prices, which we estimate increased an overall 6% in the quarter, with increases in all 4 segments.
I also want to point out that our ability to gain new pieces of the business and take market share also contributed to the strong performance as our analysis shows, we had total organic sales growth due to net share gains of approximately 4% in the second quarter of 2021 versus the second quarter of 2020.
So we continue to feel good about our ability to deliver on our historical performance of consistently growing 2% to 4% points above the market due to our share gains.
Overall, our cost of raw materials have increased an additional 10% since our last call in May when our original expectation was that it will begin to stabilize in June.
Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is now $277 million compared to the $222 million in 2020.
Synergy achievement also was a factor in our results as we achieved $18.5 million in the current quarter compared to $12.5 million last year.
However, our leverage ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA continued to improve from 3.1 at the end of the first quarter to 2.7 now.
We will have a step change in our profitability essentially complete our integration cost synergies continue to grow above the market by taking share and reach our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage of 2.5%.
As I begin to discuss our quarterly performance, I'll point you to Slide 6, 7 and 8 in our call charts, which provide a further look into our financials.
Our record net sales of $435.3 million increased 52% from the prior year and this was driven by 35% higher volumes, 8% from foreign exchange, 5% percent from acquisitions and 4% from price and mix.
When looking sequentially, we were up 1% from the first quarter as increases from our pricing initiatives offset about 3% lower volumes quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to our gross margin trend, our second quarter margin ended at 35.5% which as we expected, was down roughly 1% sequentially due to the pricing lag that Mike previously discussed.
That said we did show improvement compared to 34% in the prior year, but this 1.5% improvement year-over-year is really due to the impact of fixed manufacturing costs on prior year volume levels as well as the benefit of strong execution of integration synergies, which offset higher raw material costs in the current quarter.
SG&A was up $22 million compared to the prior year quarter as we had additional direct selling costs due to our increase in sales, higher labor and other costs that were directly impacted by COVID last year.
The net of this performance resulted in our second highest ever adjusted EBITDA of $70.1 million for the quarter, up 118% compared to the prior year COVID impacted, $32 million.
As you could see in chart 9, this increased our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA to a record $277 million.
From a tax perspective, we had an effective tax rate of 32.2% in the quarter compared to 57.9% in the prior year.
Excluding various one-time items in each period, our tax rate would have been 24% for the current quarter compared to 18% in the prior year, which was a bit low due to the impacts from COVID on our effective tax rate.
To note, we do expect both our 3rd quarter and full-year effective tax rates will be in the range of 24% to 26%.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.82 grew over 700% compared to the prior year as our strong operating earnings, coupled with over $1 million of interest savings due to lower borrowing rates or partially offset by slightly higher tax expense.
As we look to the Company's liquidity summarized on chart 10, our net debt of $759.2 million increased about $9 million in the quarter, which is primarily driven by $7.1 million of dividends paid, $6 million of additional investments in normal CapEx as well as a small acquisition, which were partially offset by $3 million of operating cash flow.
Despite an increase in net debt, the company was able to significantly improved our reported leverage ratio to 2.7 times as of Q2 2021 compared to 3.1 times at the end of March.
This includes prioritizing debt reduction, while continuing to pay our dividends, which we just to get out the 5% increase as well as investing in acquisitions that provide growth opportunities which make strategic sense.
And all while remaining committed to reducing our leverage, which we still expect to be at our target of 2.5 times by the end of the year.
