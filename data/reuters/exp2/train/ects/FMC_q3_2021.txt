We grew our revenue by 10%, EBITDA by 12%, earnings per share by 17% and importantly, expanded our EBITDA margins despite continuing cost pressures.
New products introduced in the last 12 months continue to gain momentum, and we are now forecasting sales from these products to account for more than 1/3 of our revenue growth this year.
In addition, FMC's Plant Health business had an excellent quarter with 40% year over year growth led by biologicals.

Adjusted EBITDA was $293 million, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year period and $18 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.
EBITDA margins were 24.6%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by mix improvement as well as operational discipline and price increases in all regions.

Plant Health products grew approximately 50% in the region led by biologicals and seed treatment.
EMEA grew revenue 12% and 10% organically, driven by strong demand for our herbicides and diamides across the whole region despite headwinds from registration cancellations.
Our U.S. and Canada branded business grew greater than 20%, driven by strong demand for our diamides and four herbicide applications as well as pricing actions.
Overall, North America sales decreased 6% year over year and 6% organically due to the continued shift of diamide global partner sales in the quarter from North America to other regions as we have described in previous calls.
Despite continuing supply issues across the industry, FMC's third quarter revenue increased by 10% versus prior year, driven by a 9% contribution from volume.
Gross prices increased 1% in the quarter as our most recent pricing actions went into effect.
EBITDA in the third quarter was up 12% year over year, primarily due to broad based volume gains.

We forecast EBITDA growth of 29% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020 and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 41% year over year.

Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% price contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX.
These sales are now expected to contribute $140 million in year over year growth, up from our last forecast of $130 million and our initial view of $100 million.
Interest expense for the quarter was $33.1 million, down $2.4 million from the prior year period, driven by the benefit of lower debt balances and lower LIBOR rates.
We continue to expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year.

We returned $262 million to shareholders in the quarter via $62 million in dividends and $200 million of share repurchases, buying back 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $95.26 per share.
We have now repurchased just over three million shares this year, reducing our share count by nearly 2.5% since the beginning of the year.
Year to date, we've returned $486 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases.
For the full year, we continue to anticipate paying dividends of roughly $250 million and to repurchase $350 million to $450 million of FMC shares.
Turning to slide 10.
Taking all this into consideration, our current early thinking would suggest year over year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, EBITDA growth of 7% to 9% and earnings per share growth at over 10%, in line with our long range plan.
