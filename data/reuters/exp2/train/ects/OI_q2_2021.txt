We reported adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share.
Shipments improved 18% and production rebounded 27% compared to the prior year, which was impacted by the onset of the pandemic.
We expect third quarter adjusted earnings will approximate $0.47 to $0.52, which is a significant improvement from the prior year.
We now anticipate full year earnings of between $1.65 and $1.75 per share and $260 million of cash flow.
Total shipments increased 18% this year compared to a 15% decline last year.
In the Americas, second quarter shipments were up 17%, with all geographies improving from the prior year.
In Europe, shipments were up 22% and all geographies improved double digits from last year.
The chart on the right illustrates how food and beverage consumption patterns should evolve across channels over the next 18 to 24 months.
While markets had already rebounded well in the third quarter of last year, we expect our shipments to be flat to up 1% in the third quarter of this year.
While our prior guidance called for 3% to 4% growth, we now expect growth of between 4% and 5% in 2021.
We have targeted $50 million of initiative benefits as well as continued performance improvement in North America.
Benefits totaled $40 million during the first half, and we now expect to exceed our original $50 million target for the full year.
Our digital marketing campaign is well underway with over 660 million impressions program to date and the campaign has reached over 80 million people across the U.S.
Regarding our divestiture program, we have completed or entered into agreements for $930 million of assets sales to date.
So we are over 80% of our way toward our targeted divestitures by the end of 2022.
O-I reported adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share.
Results exceeded our guidance of $0.45 to $0.50, given stronger-than-anticipated shipments and favorable cost performance.
In particular, sales volume was up more than 18% from last year compared to our expectation of 15% or higher.
Segment profit was $232 million and significantly exceeded prior year results, which were impacted by the onset of the pandemic.
Likewise, favorable cost performance was driven by a 27% improvement in production levels as the prior year was impacted by forced curtailment due to lockdown measures.
In the Americas, segment profit was $124 million, which is a significant increase compared to $52 million last year.
Higher earnings reflected 17% higher sales volume as the prior year was impacted by the onset of the pandemic.
In Europe, segment profit was $108 million compared to $42 million last year.
The significant earnings improvement reflected a 22% increase in sales volume, while the benefit of higher selling prices partially offset cost inflation.
In the case of both regions, very good operating performance, mostly reflected higher production, which increased 28% in each segment, while supply chains remain very tight across the globe.
Adjusted primarily for the divestiture of ANZ, segment profit was up $7 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2019.
I'm now on page 10.
As illustrated on the chart, our second quarter cash flow was $117 million and was comparable to the prior year, which benefited from significant inventory reduction due to forced production curtailment.
Second, we preserved our strong liquidity and finished the second quarter with approximately $2.2 billion committed liquidity well above the established floor.
We expect net debt will end the year below $4.4 billion, and our BCA leverage ratio should end the year in the high 3s compared to 4.4 times at the end of 2020.
At the end of the second quarter, net debt was down almost $1 billion from the same period last year, reflecting improved free cash flow and proceeds from divestitures.
Furthermore, our bank credit agreement leverage ratio was around 3.8 times as of midyear, which is well below our covenant limit.
Finally, we intend to derisk legacy liabilities as we advance the Paddock Chapter 11 process.
As previously announced, we have an agreement-in-principle for a consensual plan of reorganization, whereby O-I will support Paddock's funding of a 524(g) trust.
Total consideration is $610 million to be funded at the effective date of the plan.
I'm now on page 11.
We expect third quarter adjusted earnings will approximate $0.47 to $0.52 per share.
Overall, we expect shipments will be flat to up 1% from the prior year.
Production should be up about 8% to 10% from last year, which was still impacted by lockdown measures in some markets.
We now expect adjusted earnings of $1.65 to $1.75 per share and free cash flow of approximately $260 million.
This adjustment reflects higher expected shipment levels, which we now anticipate will increase 4% to 5% compared to 2020.
Likewise, we expect the benefit of our margin expansion initiatives will also exceed our original goal of $50 million.
Let me wrap up with a few comments on slide 12.
