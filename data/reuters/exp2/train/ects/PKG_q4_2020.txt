Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2020 net income of $124 million or $1.30 per share.
Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2020 net income was $127 million or $1.33 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019's net income of $163 million or $1.71 per share.
Fourth quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019.
Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $293 million in 2020 and $335 million in 2019.
Fourth quarter net income included special items of $3 million primarily for facilities closure and restructuring costs.
In addition, we also reported full year 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share compared to 2019's earnings excluding special items of $726 million or $7.65 per share.
Net sales were $6.7 billion in 2020 and $7 billion in 2019.
Excluding the special items, total company EBITDA in 2020 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.45 billion in 2019.
Excluding special items, the $0.38 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2020 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.30; the Paper segment, $0.05; lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.27 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs of $0.08.
High demand for trucks due to low inventories along with driver shortages and rail rate increases drove higher freight expenses of $0.07 and our tax rate was $0.05 per share higher primarily due to some of the benefits we had in 2019 that were not repeated in 2020.
These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.40 per share and excellent management of costs during the quarter, which resulted in lower operating costs of $0.01 and lower other costs of $0.03 per share.
EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $303 million with sales of $1.54 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.46 billion or a 21% margin.
For the full year 2020, Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 21% margin compared to full year 2019 EBITDA of $1.3 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or 22% margin.
As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year.
Said another way, although there were three less shipping days this quarter compared to the third quarter, our total fourth quarter shipments exceeded the third quarter by 2.2%.
For the full year, annual corrugated shipment records were set as well, both in total and per day, up 5.8% and 5.4%, respectively, with one more shipping day compared to 2019.
Outside sales volume of containerboard was 16,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter as we ran our containerboard system to supply the record needs of our box plants.
Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and down $0.11 per share versus the third quarter of 2020 primarily due to a less rich mix as the graphics and point-of-purchase display business as well as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest tails off during this period.
Export containerboard prices were $0.01 per share above both the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as the third quarter of 2020.
Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $10 million with sales of $156 million or 6% margin compared to fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA of $53 million and sales of $244 million or a 22% margin.
For the full year 2020, Paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was $73 million with sales of $675 million or an 11% margin compared to the full year 2019 EBITDA of $213 million with sales of $964 million or a 22% margin.
As expected, sales volume was below seasonally stronger third quarter levels and over 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019.
Average paper prices and mix were 1% below the third quarter of 2020 and approximately 3% below the fourth quarter of 2019.
For the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations of $271 million and free cash flow of $103 million.
The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $168 million.
Common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $51 million for federal and state income tax payments and net interest payments of $40 million.
We ended the year with $975 million of cash on hand or just over $1.1 billion, including marketable securities.
Our liquidity at December 31 was just under $1.5 billion.
For the full year 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion.
We had capital spending of $421 million.
Free cash flow was $612 million.
Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25% and our final reported cash tax rate was 18%.
Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $500 million to $525 million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion since that is still being evaluated, as Mark indicated earlier.
DD&A is expected to be approximately $407 million.
Pension and post-retirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million, which is net of a nonoperating pension benefit of almost $20 million primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020.
We also expect to make cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million.
Based on the recent 27% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $380 million.
Our full year interest expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $95 million and net cash interest payments should be about $93 million.
The estimate for our 2021 combined federal and state cash tax rate is about 20.5% and for our book effective tax rate, approximately 25%.
Currently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2021 will result in approximately 81,000 less tons of containerboard production compared to 2020.
The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, is expected to be $0.90 per share compared to the $0.65 per share we had in 2020.
The current estimated impact by quarter in 2021 is $0.10 per share in the first quarter, $0.25 in the second, $0.13 in the third quarter and $0.42 per share in the fourth.
These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC.
