For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 12%, with growth across all segments.
Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 130 basis points of price.
Of the approximately $220 million in acquired revenue, about 65% is consumable revenue from both Key and Cantel Medical, about 20% of the balance is capital equipment revenue, with the last 15% being service revenue.
Gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points compared to the prior year to 46.2%, as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by higher material and labor costs.
Combined, material and labor costs were about $10 million in the quarter, significantly higher than we were expecting.
As we look at the second half of the fiscal year, we anticipate that higher material labor costs will continue to impact gross margin by approximately $20 million or more.
EBIT margin for the quarter was 23.3% of revenue, an increase of 80 basis points from the second quarter of last year.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22%, higher than last year, but in line with our expectations for the full fiscal year.
Net income in the quarter increased to $200.3 million and earnings per share were $1.99.
Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter is now below 2.8 times.
The total cash settlement value was approximately $371.4 million.
At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $383.5 million.
During the first half, capital expenditures totaled $133.4 million, while depreciation and amortization was $201.7 million, reflecting recent acquisitions.
Free cash flow for the first half was $135.8 million.
In particular, growth in our AST segment remained strong, with 23% constant currency organic growth year-to-date despite some tough comparisons in the second quarter of last year.
Healthcare has also rebounded nicely, with 17% constant currency organic growth in the first half and record backlog of $311 million at the end of the quarter for the legacy STERIS products.
Life Sciences consumables have stabilized, contributing 3% constant currency organic growth in the first half.
