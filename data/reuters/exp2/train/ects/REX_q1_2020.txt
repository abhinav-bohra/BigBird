Sales for the quarter decreased 20.4%, primarily due to lower production levels, as we idled our NuGen plant mid first quarter as the crush margin for this plant was affected by local corn availability, the COVID-19 pandemic and lower oil pricing and the impact on ethanol demand and pricing.
Ethanol sales for the quarter were based upon 48.3 million gallons this year versus 61.3 million last year.
We reported a gross loss of $8.2 million for the ethanol and byproduct segment versus a gross profit of $6.1 million in the prior year.
Gross margin in the current year was not only impacted by the lower volume and negative ethanol corn crush spread, but also by the $9.1 million lower of cost or net realizable value charge as corn and ethanol values fell sharply, due in part to the slowdown in demand from the COVID-19 impact, all of which was offset somewhat by a hedge gain of $3.1 million.
Our refined coal segment had a gross loss of $1.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 versus $2.5 million for the prior year based upon lower volume.
These losses are offset by tax benefits of $959,000 and $3.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively recorded for the Section 45 credits and the tax benefits from operating losses.
We had a loss of $477,000 from our unconsolidated equity investment in this year's first quarter versus income of $126,000 for the prior year, reflecting ethanol industry conditions.
Interest and other income declined from $1.1 million to $669,000, primarily due to lower interest rates on our cash and short-term investments, as interest rates fell sharply during the quarter.
We recorded a tax benefit of $5.3 million for the first quarter of this year versus $3.5 million in the prior year.
We recorded our federal tax benefits from losses at 35% rather than the current 21% federal tax rate, based upon our ability to carry back losses five years due to the CARES Act passed in the first quarter.
The above factors led to a net loss attributable to REX shareholders of $7.6 million in this year's first quarter versus net income of $2.8 million in the prior year.
In terms of quarter-end, we had $195 million roughly in cash on a consolidated basis.
We bought in 108,706 shares during the first quarter.
And since the first quarter, we're authorized to buy 241,185 more.
