Economic earnings per share of $4.03 grew 47% year over year and represented the strongest second quarter in our history, primarily driven by EBITDA growth of 40% and ongoing share repurchase activity.
Together with our recent investment in Boston Common, a long-term leader in impact investing, we expect that these new affiliates will contribute over 90 million in EBITDA in 2022 and contribute meaningfully to our organic growth over time.
With the addition of Parnassus, our run-rate EBITDA is now over 1 billion, increasing our opportunity to invest in new affiliates and areas of secular growth and in resources to enhance the growth of our existing affiliates, including strategic growth capital and distribution.
With the addition of Parnassus, Boston Common, and Inclusive Capital Partners, AMG's affiliates will now manage more than 80 billion in dedicated ESG strategies, and more than 600 billion in strategies that integrate ESG into their investment process, and they are positioned to capitalize on future growth as investors around the world continue to turn to active managers for responsible and impact investing.
A pioneer in sustainable investing, Parnassus has a 37-year track record of investing based on principles and performance, achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns by building portfolios that also have a positive societal impact.
We have received shareholder approval for all funds transitioning from external sub-advisors, resulting in an incremental 4 billion in assets now being managed by our affiliates.
Several years ago, we ceded the AMG Pantheon's fund with $10 million, given the opportunity we saw to provide U.S. wealth investors access to private equity portfolios.
And last week, the fund reached a significant milestone, crossing the $0.5 billion mark in AUM.
For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of 227 million grew 40% year over year, driven by strong affiliate investment performance in markets and the impact of our growth investments.
Economic earnings per share of $4.03 grew 47% year over year.
Net client cash inflows, excluding certain quantitative strategies, worth 3 billion in the quarter, driven by private markets, specialty fixed income, U.S. equities, ESG strategies, and the strategic evolution of our U.S. wealth platform, AMG Funds.
Outflows from certain quant strategies totaled 11 billion and had a de minimis impact on our earnings.
In alternatives, our illiquid strategies posted another strong quarter, with 3.7 billion in net inflows, led by strong fundraising at Pantheon, EIG, and Bearing.
Performance in this category remained strong, with more than 90% of assets outperforming benchmarks in the most recent and prior vintages.
Within liquid alternatives, net inflows were 1.4 billion, supported by continued client appetite for alternative sources of risk and return in the low-yield environment.
We reported net outflows of 6.3 billion, driven by idiosyncratic, lower fee institutional reallocation activity.
Momentum in our U.S. equity strategies continues with inflows of 2.9 billion, driven by strong client demand, particularly for our value-focused strategies managed by leading firms such as River Road and Yactman and our small-cap strategies.
Our multi-asset and fixed-income category generated inflows of nearly $1 billion, primarily driven by ongoing demand for muni-bond strategies and wealth-management solutions, particularly at GW&K and Baker Street this quarter.
For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA of 227 million grew 40% year over year, driven by strong affiliate performance in markets and additional earnings power from our recent new affiliate investments.
Our adjusted EBITDA included 16 million of performance fees, and as I mentioned previously, reflects excellent affiliate investment performance, particularly in our liquid alternatives category.
Economic earnings per share of $4.03 grew 47% year over year, further benefiting from ongoing share repurchase activity.
Net of onetime transaction costs, we expect Parnassus to contribute approximately $15 million to our fourth-quarter EBITDA results.
On a full-year 2022 basis, we expect Parnassus to contribute approximately 70 million of EBITDA and $1.30 of economic earnings per share.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 215 to 220 million based on current AUM levels, which reflect a flat market blend through yesterday and seasonally lower performance fees of up to 5 million.
Our share of interest expense was $27 million for the second quarter, and we expect interest expense to be 28 million in the third quarter, reflecting our recent hybrid bond offering.
Controlling interest depreciation was 2 million in the second quarter, and we expect the third quarter to be at a similar level.
Our share of reported amortization and impairments was 36 million for the second quarter, and we expect it to be similar in the third quarter.
Our effective GAAP and cash tax rates were 36 and 18%, respectively, for the second quarter and we expect GAAP and cash tax rates to be 25 and 18%, respectively, for the third quarter.
Intangible-related deferred taxes were 31 million this quarter and we expect this to decline to a more normalized level of 12 million in the third quarter.
Other economic items were negative 4 million.
In the third quarter, for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items, excluding any mark-to-market impact on GPNC to be 1 million.
Our adjusted weighted average share count for the second quarter was 42.5 million, and we expect our share count to be approximately 42.1 million for the third quarter.
Earlier this month, we further enhanced the balance sheet by issuing a 40-year $200 million hybrid bond at an asset management industry low coupon of 4.2%.
In the second quarter, we repurchased $80 million of shares, bringing us to $290 million year to date, and we remain on track for $500 million of repurchases for the full year, subject to market conditions and the timing of new affiliate investments.
Over the last 24 months, we've returned nearly $1 billion of excess capital to shareholders, having repurchased nearly 20% of our shares outstanding, while simultaneously partnering with seven new affiliates, and investing in our existing affiliates and centralized capabilities.
