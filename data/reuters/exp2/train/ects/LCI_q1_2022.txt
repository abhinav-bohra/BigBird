In total, we anticipate cost savings approximately $20 million annually.
We currently have approximately 12 ANDAs pending at the FDA, including partner products, plus three additional products that are approved and pending launch.
We also have more than 20 products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts.
With regard to our large, durable partnered product pipeline, I'll provide an update on two of the 5, starting with our generic ADVAIR DISKUS product.
The plan is expected to be completed in approximately 18 months and generate annual cost savings of approximately $20 million.
