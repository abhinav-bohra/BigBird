As a result of the strong operating performance in the quarter, our cash flow from operations was 2.25 billion, as compared to 8.7 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
In the prior-year period, cash flow from operations was positively impacted by approximately 5.8 billion due to CARES Act receipts.

We have approximately 5 billion remaining on our authorization.
