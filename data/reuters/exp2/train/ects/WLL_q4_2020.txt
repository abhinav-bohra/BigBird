We filed our 10-K yesterday, and you can refer to it for detailed information, so I hope to highlight some of the significant items.
Adjusted EBITDAX was $120 million for the quarter and $382 million for the year after adjusting for the nonrecurring items related to the restructuring and reorganization compared to $241 million and $979 million for the respective periods of 2019.
Despite the lower activity level and commodity price environment, the company generated nearly $90 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to approximately $86 million in the same period of 2019.
On September 1, 2020, the company emerged with $425 million drawn on its $750 million facility.
As of December 31, 2020, the company's debt was down to $334 million net of cash on hand, and is projected to be paid down to approximately $275 million as we exit February.
We would've paid down $150 million since September 1 and as we generate free cash flow, we'll continue to reduce our borrowings as that is part of our credit facility that was set up at emergence, and is our liquidity and dry powder as we think about future opportunities.
Our production for the quarter averaged 91,700 barrels of oil equivalent, of which 61% was crude oil.
Our capital program and guidance is designed to essentially hold 2021 production flat from our December 31, 2020 exit rate, and we estimate full-year 2021 production to be in the range of 82,000 to 88,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and oil to be in the range of 48,000 to 52,000 barrels of oil per day.
We spent $21 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter to bring five wells onto production and commenced completion operations on an additional six wells.
In 2021, we expect to spend $240 million at the midpoint of our capital expenditure guidance.
We plan on turning 56 wells to production in 2021, of which 13 are scheduled for the first quarter that were drilled and uncompleted wells as of year-end.
Lease operating expenses were $55 million or $6.57 per BOE for the fourth quarter.
I will note that winter has since returned to North Dakota in early February, where temperatures have been below 0 for the most consecutive days since 1936, with temperatures frequently reaching negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
We currently have 70% of our total forecasted crude oil hedged in 2021 and 75% of our natural gas.
We have utilized a combination of fixed price swaps and collars, which are further detailed in our 10-K.
As we have guided previously, we believe we will generate over $150 million of free cash flow in 2021 at a $45 WTI crude oil price and a $2.50 NYMEX natural gas price.
As a rule of thumb, for every $1 move in WTI, we expect approximately $10 million change in cash flows, but this will be affected by hedging at varying price levels.
Our estimated proved reserves were 260 million barrels of oil equivalent with a PV10 of $1.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to 485 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2019.
The pricing per barrel under SEC rules for December 31, 2020 was approximately $40 per barrel compared to December 31, 2019, which was approximately $56 per barrel or a total reduction of just over $16 per barrel.
Gas per Mcf decreased to $1.99 from $2.58 for the same two periods.
Interestingly, since we have experienced a significant change in WTI pricing over the last few months, we wanted to internally run our reserves at $50 per barrel and $3 natural gas to see the impact on our reserves.
This pricing increased our proved reserves by approximately 20% and doubled our PV10 values.
As you may have seen in the prerelease, we agreed to a settlement with a general unsecured claimant where we released approximately 949,000 shares from the bankruptcy settlement pool in exchange for a release of claims, which eliminates certain obligations in our Redtail project.
These shares have a lockup feature, preventing to sell more than 50% of the shares during any 30-day period.
After the settlement, our share count is approximately 39 million beginning in the first quarter of 2021.
