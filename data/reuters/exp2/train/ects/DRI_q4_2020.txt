It has been 14 weeks since our last earnings call.
I don't know about all of you, but it's felt more like 14 months.
Prior to the pandemic, total annual sales for the casual dining industry was approximately $108 billion.
In addition to rolling out permanent paid sick leave, we introduced a three-week emergency pay program that provided nearly $75 million of pay during the fourth quarter for our hourly team members who could not work.
During the quarter, online ordering at Olive Garden grew by more than 300% over prior year and accounted for 58% of To Go sales.
At LongHorn, online ordering grew by 400% and accounted for 49% of the gross sales.
We have also brought 60,000 furloughed restaurant team members back to work, and we expect to bring at least another 40,000 back as business continues to improve.
During the quarter, we suspended the dividend and share repurchases, fully drew down our $750 million credit facility, took out a $270 million term loan and raised over $500 million in a follow-on equity offering.
Now turning to the results, the total sales were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 43%.
Same restaurant sales decreased 47.7%, and adjusted diluted net loss per share was $1.24.
As we look at the labor line, there was significant deleverage in management labor, including approximately $25 million in manager bonuses.
However, we saw an improvement in hourly labor as a percent of sales of over 150 basis points, even with a substantial reduction in sales.
Restaurant expenses per operating week decreased over 20%, given our focus on cost management, even as we incurred over $5 million in incremental cleaning supplies and PPE related to COVID-19.
For marketing and G&A expense, we were able to reduce the absolute spend by $37 million and $17 million respectively versus last year.
Included in our restaurant labor and to a small extent G&A is approximately $50 million of investments net of retention credits.
This negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.30, which was not adjusted out of reported earnings.
During the quarter, we impaired $390 million of assets as a result of lower sales, reduced profitability and lower market capitalization.
The impairments related to $314 million of Cheddar's goodwill and trademark assets, $47 million of restaurant level assets and $29 million of other assets.
We permanently closed 11 restaurants in the quarter, six of which were already impaired.
The entire $300 million -- $390 million of impairment charges were adjusted out of our reported earnings.
We ended the quarter with $763 million in cash and another $750 million available in our credit facility.
This gives us over $1.5 billion of liquidity available to weather the crisis and make appropriate investments to grow profitably.
Our adjusted debt to adjusted capital at the end of the quarter was 61%, well within our debt covenant of 75%.
With last week's blended same restaurant sales down 30%, we are operating cash flow positive at these levels.
We expect to achieve approximately 70% of prior year sales levels, total EBITDA of at least $75 million and diluted net earnings per share of greater than or equal to zero on a diluted share base of 131 million shares.
For the full year, we intend to open between 35 and 40 net new restaurants.
In total, we expect between $250 million and $350 million of capital spending for fiscal '21.
Dave and I have been partners on this journey for 23 years.
He was a joint venture partner for LongHorn when I joined [Indecipherable] in 1997.
Over the last 23 years, Dave has been successful in every one of his leadership positions.
For many of the last 23 years, Dave and I have had lunched together on Monday to discuss what happened in the previous week and talk about what needed to get done going forward.
Not much has changed over those 23 years, except today, we order salads instead of two or three entrees each.
