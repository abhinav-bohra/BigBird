In the second quarter, net income was $200 million, or $1.92 per share compared to $173 million or $1.62 per share a year ago.
Net operating income for the quarter was $193 million or $1.85 per share, an increase of 12% per share from a year ago.
On a GAAP reported basis return on equity as of June 30 was 9% for the first half of the year and 9.7% for the second quarter.
Book value per share was $83.59.
Excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities, return on equity was 12.4% for the first half of the year and 13.5% for the second quarter.
In addition, book value per share grew 9% to $55.66.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue increased 9% from the year ago quarter to $728 million.
Life underwriting margin was $179 million, up 11% from a year ago.
For the year, we expect life premium revenue to grow between 8% to 9% and underwriting margin to grow 5% to 6%.
In health insurance, premium revenue grew 4% to $296 million and health underwriting margin was up 16% to $74 million.
For the year, we expect health premium revenue to grow between 4% and 5% and underwriting margin to grow around 9%.
Administrative expenses were $68 million for the quarter, up 10% from a year ago.
As a percentage of premium, administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.5% a year ago.
For the full year, we expect administrative expenses to grow 8% to 9% and be around 6.7% of premium due primarily to increased IT and information security cost, higher pension expense, and a gradual increase in travel and facility costs.
At American Income Life, life premiums were up over the year ago quarter to $348 million and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $108 million.
In the second quarter of 2021, net life sales were $73 million, up 42%.

Net life sales increased 67% to $18 million and net health sales were $6 million, up 52% from the year ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count and increased agent productivity.
The average producing agent count for the second quarter was 2,700, up 13% from the year ago quarter, while down 1% from the first quarter.
The producing agent count at Liberty National ended the quarter at 2,700.
At Family Heritage, health premiums increased 9% over the year ago quarter to $85 million and health underwriting margin increased 18% to $22 million.
Net health sales were up 41% to $19 million due to increased agent productivity.

At United American General Agency, health premiums increased 3% over the year ago quarter to $116 million and health underwriting margin increased 16% to $18 million.
Net health sales were $12 million, up 1% compared to the year ago quarter.
We expect the producing agent count for each agency at the end of 2021 to be in the following ranges: American Income Life, 3% to 6% growth; Liberty National, 1% to 8% growth; Family Heritage, a decline of 1% to 9%.
Net life sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: American Income Life, an increase of 13% to 17%; Liberty National, an increase of 26% to 32%; direct-to-consumer, a decrease of 10% to flat.
Net health sales for the full year 2021 are expected to be as follows: Liberty National, an increase of 12% to 18%; Family Heritage, an increase of 4% to 8%; United American Individual Medicare Supplement, a decrease of 1% to an increase of 9%.
Excess investment income, which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt, was $60 million, a 2% decline from the year ago quarter.
On a per share basis, reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program, excess investment income grew 2%.
For the full year, we expect excess investment income to decline 1% to 2%, but to grow around 2% on a per share basis.
In the second quarter, we invested $116 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the financial, municipal and industrial sectors.
We invested at an average yield of 3.69%, an average rating of A, and an average life of 35 years.
We also invested $72 million in limited partnerships that invest in credit instruments.
For the entire fixed maturity portfolio, the second quarter yield was 5.24%, down 14 basis points from the second quarter of 2020.
As of June 30, the portfolio yield was 5.23%.
Invested assets are $19.1 billion, including $17.5 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost.
Of the fixed maturities, $16.7 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A- and below investment grade bonds are $764 million compared to $802 million at the end of the first quarter.
The percentage of below investment grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.4%.
Excluding net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio, the low investment grade bonds as a percentage of equity was 13%.
Consistent with recent years, bonds rated BBB are 55% of the fixed maturity portfolio.
At the midpoint of our guidance, we are assuming an average new money rate of around 3.45% for fixed maturities for the remainder of 2021.
Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited, as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next five years.
The parent ended the second with liquid assets of approximately $545 million.
This amount is higher than last quarter, because in June, the company issued a 40-year $325 million junior subordinated note with a coupon rate of 4.15%.
Net proceeds were $317 million.
On July 15, the company utilized the proceeds to call our $300 million 6.125% junior subordinated notes due 2056.
We anticipate the parent company's excess cash flow for the full year to be approximately $365 million.
Of which, approximately $185 million will be generated in the second half of 2021.
In the second quarter, the company repurchased 1.2 million shares of Global Life Inc. common stock at a total cost of $123 million at an average share price of $101.05.
The total spend was higher than anticipated as we took advantage of the sharp drop in share price at the end of the quarter and accelerated approximately $30 million of purchases from the second half of the year to repurchase shares at an average price of $95.62.
So far in July, we have spent $32 million to repurchase 343,000 shares at an average price of $93.81.
Thus, for the full year through today, we have spent approximately $246 million to purchase 2.5 million shares at an average price of $97.96.
Taking into account the liquid assets of $545 million at the end of the second quarter, plus approximately $185 million of excess cash flows that we are expected to generate in the second half of the year, less the $32 million spent on share repurchases in July and the $300 million to call our junior subordinated note, we will have approximately $400 million of assets available to the parent for the remainder of the year.
However, at this time, the midpoint of our earnings guidance only reflects approximately $120 million of share repurchases over the remainder of the year.
As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated company action level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%.
At December 31, 2020, our consolidated RBC ratio was 309%.
At this RBC ratio, our insurance subsidiaries have approximately $50 million of capital over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated RBC target of 300%.
This excess capital, along with the roughly $400 million of liquid assets we expect to be available at the parent, provide sufficient liquidity to fund future capital needs.
In our base case, we anticipate approximately $370 million of additional NAIC 1 notch downgrades.
Combined, our base case approximately $105 million of additional capital will be needed at our insurance subsidiaries to offset the adverse impact of the new factors and additional downgrades in order to maintain the midpoint of our consolidated RBC targets.
In the first half of 2021, the company has incurred approximately $49 million of COVID death claims, including $11 million in the second quarter.
The $11 million incurred is $10 million less than incurred in the year ago quarter and is in line with our expectations for the quarter.
The total COVID death benefits in the second quarter included $4.6 million incurred in our direct-to-consumer division or 2% of its second quarter premium income, $1.5 million incurred at Liberty National or 2% of its premium for the quarter and $3.5 million at American Income or 1% of its second quarter premium.
At the midpoint of our guidance, we anticipate approximately 20,000 to 30,000 additional COVID deaths to occur over the remainder of 2021.
As in prior quarters, we continue to estimate that we will incur COVID life claims of roughly $2 million for every 10,000 U.S. deaths.
We are estimating a range of COVID death claims of $53 million to $55 million for the substantially unchanged from our previous guidance.
As such, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance from $7.36 to $7.44 with an overall range of $7.34 to $7.54 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
