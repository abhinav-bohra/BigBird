Bruce joined First Industrial as our CEO in 2009 during a difficult period and provided tremendous leadership to help stabilize and transform our business model and portfolio.
As of yesterday, we have collected 98% of 2Q monthly rental billings and so far, we've collected 97% of July billings, which is ahead of the pace we experienced in the second quarter.
If we include collections from government-related tenants that regularly pay at the end of the month, our collection rate for July would also be 98%.
About 65% of the outstanding monthly rental billings in the second quarter were in jurisdictions that have moratoriums on the landlord's right to evict, which we believe, is a contributing factor toward the open receivables for this group.
Including surrendered security deposits and bad debt reserves recognized in the second quarter, our outstanding accounts receivable related to our monthly rental billings in 2Q is only $550,000.
During the COVID-19 crisis to-date, we have established rent deferment agreements with 14 tenants totaling $750,000 or about 18 basis points of annualized billings.
The average term for these deferrals is 1.3 months.
In its second quarter preliminary flash report, CBRE reported 19 million square feet of net absorption versus 56 million square feet of completion.
This view is supported by CBRE's recent forecast that annual net industrial absorption will total more than 333 million square feet by 2022.
If they are right, net absorption for the sector will exceed the high watermark, post a great financial crisis of 324 million square feet in 2016 and the all-time mark of 329 million square feet in 2000.
Despite completions exceeding net absorption nationally in the quarter, our portfolio occupancy increased to 97.7% at quarter-end.
We also achieved a big leasing win at our Nottingham Ridge Logistics Center in the I-95 North submarket in Baltimore.
We leased 100% of the 585,000 square foot Building A to a leading e-commerce provider on a long term basis, which commenced in late June.
Considering we purchased this asset in the first quarter, we leased this property significantly ahead of the 12-month lease-up budgeted in our guidance.
With just 54,000 square feet remaining to lease, we are now 93% occupied at this 751,000 square foot two-building project.
As of July 22nd, we have signed 83% of our 2020 lease expirations at a cash rental rate increase of 8.6%.
For the full year, we expect our cash rental rate change on new and renewal leasing to be approximately 10%.
We acquired a 39,000 square-footer in Fremont in Northern California and added an adjacent building comprised of 46,000 square feet.
The aggregate purchase price was $17.8 million with a weighted average initial yield of approximately 4.6%.
We also added a 9.7-acre covered land investment in the Inland Empire for $3.5 million.
The site has a 3% in-place yield for the next several years, generating some cash for us as we entitled the site.
The site will accommodate a 155,000 square foot development.
Thus far in the third quarter, we have closed on a 6.6-acre site in Seattle for $6.1 million that can accommodate a 129,000 square foot building.
The building will be 221,000 square feet and it's leased on a long term basis to a manufacturer of material handling systems.
Total investment is $22.4 million and the initial cash yield will be approximately 6.2%.
We are proceeding with all of our developments in process, which totaled 1 million square feet and a total investment of $94.7 million at June 30th.
In addition to our on-balance sheet developments, construction on the 643,000 square foot spec building in our Phoenix joint venture at PV303 is progressing well.
Our portion of the investment is $21 million and our targeted yield is 7%.
Our on-balance sheet land holdings will accommodate approximately 13 million square feet of future developments, the vast majority of which is entitled and ready to go.
In the second quarter, we sold three buildings totaling 211,000 square feet for $14.6 million.
Year-to-date, we sold 437,000 square feet for a total of $41.1 million.
As a reminder, in the third quarter, we expect to close on the $55 million sale in Phoenix, in which the tenant exercised its purchase option in 2019.
On July 7th, we entered into a private placement agreement to issue $300 million in total of 10 and 12 year notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.81%.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.28 versus $0.31 one year-ago and NAREIT funds from operations were $0.46 per fully diluted share compared to $0.43 per share in 2Q 2019.
Second quarter 2020 FFO includes approximately $500,000 of cash bad debt expense related to tenant accounts receivable and $400,000 of non-cash bad debt expense related to the write-off of certain deferred rent receivables.
Pier 1 has paid July rents and we are assuming they pay August rent, which in total represents a $500,000 pick up from our prior guidance.
Occupancy was strong at 97.7%, up 60 basis points from the prior quarter and up 40 basis points from a year-ago.
As for leasing volume during the quarter, we commenced approximately 2.9 million square feet of leases, 600,000 were new, 1.6 million were renewals and 700,000 were for developments and acquisitions with lease-up.
Tenant retention by square footage was 88.7%.
Same-store NOI growth on a cash basis, excluding termination fees, was 6.3% helped by increase in rental rates on new and renewal leasing, a decrease in free rent and rental rate bumps embedded in our leases.
Cash rental rates were up 11% overall with renewals up 8.9% and new leasing 16.7%.
And on a straight-line basis, overall rental rates were up 32.4% with renewals increasing 30.6% and new leasing up 37.5%.
First, we entered into an agreement to issue $300 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes in a private placement offering.
The notes are comprised of two tranches, $100 million with a 10-year term at a rate of 2.74% and $200 million with a 12-year term at a rate of 2.84%.
We also refinanced our $200 million unsecured term loan, previously scheduled to mature at the end of January 2021.
The loan features interest-only payments and bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points.
In conjunction with the new term loan, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements that convert the loan to a fixed interest rate of 2.49%, beginning in February 2021.
After these two executions, one of our remaining 2021 maturities is the aforementioned $63 million of secure debt in the fourth quarter.
Our leverage is also in good shape with our net debt plus preferred stock to EBITDA at 5.2 times at January -- at June 30th.
Our guidance range for NAREIT FFO and FFO before one-time items is now $1.76 to $1.84 per share with a midpoint of $1.80.
This is an increase of $0.02 per share compared to the midpoint of our guidance on our first quarter call.
The increase is primarily due to the early lease up of the 585,000 square foot building at the Nottingham Ridge Logistics Center as well as two months of additional rental income from Pier 1.
Our assumption for the average -- for the range of average quarter-end occupancy remains 96% to 97% and our cash bad debt expense assumption remains $900,000 for each of the third and fourth quarters.
Other key assumptions for guidance are as follows, same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 3.25% to 4.25%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint and a tightening of the range.
Our G&A guidance range remains at $31 million to $32 million and guidance also includes the anticipated 2020 costs related to our completed and under construction developments at June 30th, plus the third quarter start of First Nandina II.
In total, for the full year 2020, we expect to capitalize about $0.04 per share of interest related to our developments.
