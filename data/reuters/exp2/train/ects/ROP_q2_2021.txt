Specific to the financial metrics, which Rob will detail shortly, revenue, EBITDA, Dearnings per share and cash flow, all grew north of 20% in the quarter.
Our software businesses, which now make up over 55% of our revenue base performed very well in the quarter.
Specifically, on an organic basis, we grew our Application Software segment 9% and grew our software businesses within our NSS segment 10%.
Across our software businesses, we saw the acceleration of our recurring revenue growth, approximately 80% of our soft revenues from mid-singles to high-singles and a solid recovery of perpetual license activity.
Importantly, and consistent with our guidance over the last three quarters, we continue to delever our balance sheet at a rapid pace now under 4 times debt to EBITDA.
Total revenue increased 22% to $1.59 billion another record for any Roper quarter.
Q2 organic revenue growth was 7% versus last year's comp of minus 3.
Q2 EBITDA grew 26% to $579 million and EBITDA margin increased to 110 basis points to 36.4%.
Adjusted Dearnings per share was $3.76, 28% above prior year and also above our Q2 guidance range of $3.61 to $3.65.
Free cash flow was $409 million, up a very strong 30% versus last year.
Net working capital was negative 8%, we continue to benefit from Roper's transformation to a high recurring revenue, majority software business model that is structurally designed to consistently drive high cash conversion.
Lastly, we have been laser-focused on debt reduction this year after last year's record capital deployment and we continue to make great progress on that front with an additional $375 million paid down in Q2.
Through the first half of 2021, we have now reduced our net debt by nearly $900 million, raising the total debt reduction to approximately $1.4 billion, since completing the 2020 acquisitions late last year.
Our debt reduction along with the meaningful contributions from our 2020 acquisitions has enabled us to rapidly lower our net debt to EBITDA ratio from 4.7 times to 3.8 times in only six months.
Revenues in this segment were $592 million, up 9% on an organic basis.
As a reminder, this segment grew 1% organically last year aided by strong results from our lab software franchises that were critical to the COVID response.
EBITDA margins were 43.7% in the quarter.
Across the segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased approximately 9%.
To that end, the non-recurring organic revenue in this segment grew 9% as well.
Turning to Page 10.
Revenues in our network segment were $459 million, up 5% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 42.5% in the quarter.
Our software businesses in this segment about 65% of the revenues were, up 10% on an organic basis.
This growth was broad-based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 11%.
Based on the New York TransCore project pushing to the right, we now expect about $40 million of this projects revenue to push-out of the second half of the year and into 2022.

Now please turn to Page 14 and I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021.
Based on strong first half performance improvement to our recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we are raising our full-year adjusted Dearnings per share to be in the range of $15 and $15.20 per share.
Of note, our prior high-end Dearnings per share guidance was 15% now the bottom end of our range.
Also, we are increasing our guidance notwithstanding pushing roughly $40 million of the TransCore New York City project into next year, providing everyone a good sense of how strong the balance of our portfolio is performing.
Our full-year organic growth is expected to be 7% or a touch higher.
Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range.
For the third quarter, we're establishing adjusted Dearnings per share guidance to be between $3.80 and $3.84.
Turning to Page 15, and our closing summary.
