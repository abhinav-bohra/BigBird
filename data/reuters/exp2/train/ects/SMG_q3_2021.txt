Those are filed with our Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We've taken full advantage of the unique opportunity that presented itself over the past 18 months and have put ourselves in a great position.
We were up 48% in the quarter, and we continue to expect growth of 40% to 45% on a full-year basis.
Of course, a lot of that benefit in excess of $1 a share has been offset by commodity pressures that every company in the consumer product space is trying to navigate.
Entering the season, our research suggested about 85% of consumers who came into the category last year would return.
We believe the actual number was probably closer to 75%; however, we're confident we benefited from a higher overall level of participation as one-third of all consumers said they increased their participation in our category this spring.
When we subtract consumers who did less gardening this year from those who did more, our data suggests participation was up 8%.
Entering August, POS dollars at our largest four retail partners were up 4%.
In units, the number is 8%.
In our soils business, where four-for-10 and five-for-10 promotions were reintroduced, POS dollars are up 5% year to date.
But units, a more accurate reflection of our shipments, as well as consumer activity, are up 8%.
In mulch, dollars were up 11% and units up 20%.
And our other branded categories where the year-over-year impact of promotional activity is less pronounced, like lawn fertilizer, weed control, and grass seed, POS dollars were up 3%, 8%, and 14%, respectively.
Still, we've given up a lot of the POS gains we reported on the last call when the year-to-date number was plus 20%.
By September 30, I suspect weather will have cost us at least 2 points of growth in fiscal '21.
Our third quarter historically accounts for about 55% of full-year POS.
In the 13-week period from April through June, POS was down 1% this year compared to 2020, but it's up 24% in those same weeks compared to 2019.
POS was down 12% from 2020 levels.
However, it's up 30% from 2019 during that same nine-week window.
Compared to 2019, we expect POS for 2021 to be up more than 25%.
The current consumer trends, combined with planned higher retail inventory levels, give us a high degree of confidence in our full-year sales growth guidance for the U.S. consumer business, which we set at the range of 7% to 9%.
Through June, sales are 60% higher on a year-to-date basis as the business continues to build on its market-leading position.
In Q3, our lighting business grew 77%.
Nutrient sales were up 54% in the quarter and growing media was up 32%.
General Hydroponics grew roughly 30 points more than the total nutrient portfolio, and our Mother Earth and Botanicare brands grew three times faster than the rest of our growing media business.
The across-the-board strength led to the 48% growth we saw in the quarter, which ended with our largest sales month ever in June.
But based on everything we're seeing, it's hard to imagine growth being below 10% to 20% next year.
We have a lot of work to do over the next 90 days and our thoughts could change.
I told Cory, I'm comfortable allocating upwards of $250 million to share repurchase in the months ahead under our existing authorization, so look for us to do that.
Companywide sales were up 8% in Q3 and we're now up 29% year to date.
consumer business, where sales declined 4% in the quarter but are 19% higher year to date.
That leaves us right on track with the guidance I provided back in June when we said we expect a sales growth of 7% to 9%.
To get to our guidance means shipments in the U.S. consumer would decline by 40% to 50% year over year in Q4, and for our Hawthorne guidance to hold means a range of flat growth to plus 15%, which is obviously lower than what we've been seeing over the past year.
consumer business grew 92% in Q4 and Hawthorne grew by 64%, so the comps are extremely high.
While the shift had a negative impact of approximately $115 million on companywide sales in Q3, it has added approximately $50 million on a year-to-date basis, which is pretty evenly divided between U.S. consumer and Hawthorne.
Of course, that means we'll have fewer days in Q4 so that $50 million would come out of Q4 in order for the shift to be neutral on a full-year basis.
In Hawthorne, the other major year-over-year headwind in Q4 is the 82% comp we're up against in California, which accounts for about 45% of our annual sales in the U.S.
But net-net, we still expect Hawthorne to finish the year with 40% to 50% growth on top of last year's 60% growth.
In fact, our sales after nine months this year are already 7% higher than all of 2020.
In the third quarter, these issues led to an adjusted gross margin rate of 30.8%, a decline of 530 basis points from a year ago.
I expect another significant decline in the fourth quarter, which would likely result in a full-year decline of approximately 275 basis points.
Through nine months, the adjusted gross margin rate is 280 points lower than last year.
Year to date, higher distribution costs impacted the gross margin rate by 260 basis points and higher material costs put another 130 points of pressure on that rate.
Those pressures were partially offset by more than 100 basis points of fixed-cost leverage.
However, of the 390 points of downward rate pressure, about 235 basis points were unplanned.
As we look ahead to next year, only about 25% of our costs are locked right now.
The pricing that just took effect in the U.S. consumer was a little more than 5%.
If you recall, we originally said Bonnie would add $0.12 to $0.15 to earnings this year.
Since then, we saw further erosion of their results, which is now leading to about a $0.20 headwind for the full year.
Remember, our results this year exclude Bonnie's first quarter due to the timing of when we struck our 50-50 JV with them.
We currently are contemplating another bond offering to lock in longer-term bonds, probably with a 10- to 12-year maturity at roughly 4%.
Bringing things down to the bottom line, GAAP earnings were $4 per share in the quarter and $9.90 year to date, an increase of 12% and 47%, respectively.
On a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which is how we provide guidance, earnings per share in the quarter improved 5% to $3.98 per share and 39% to $10.04 per share year to date.
In addition, our low debt leverage, which was less than 2.2 times at the end of the quarter, gives us an enormous amount of financial flexibility to continue funding acquisitions and infrastructure improvement while also returning cash to shareholders.
