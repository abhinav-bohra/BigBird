These results are especially impressive considering the fact that the dollar value of announced M&A transactions globally declined 24% in the first quarter and the dollar value of closed M&A transaction fell by 37% compared to the quarter a year ago.
Due to the strength of our advisory revenues compared to the declines experienced by our larger competitors, we expect to increase again our market share of advisory fees among all publicly reporting firms on a trailing 12-month basis, the 8.6% from 7.9% for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2019, and from 8.3% at the end of 2019.

For the first quarter of 2020, net revenues, net income and earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $427 million, $31.2 million and $0.74 respectively.

Our GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 25.8% compared to 9.1% in the prior year period.
On a GAAP basis, our share count was 42.3 million shares for the first quarter.
On an adjusted basis, the share count was 47.7 million, down versus the prior-year period, driven by share repurchases and a lower average share price.
Finally, we hold approximately $588 million of cash and $264 million in investment securities as of March 31, 2020, with our current assets exceeding current liabilities by approximately $880 million.
