As we've previously noted, the $151 million initial seed sale to RGMZ will close in tranches over the course of 2021.
The first tranche of 13 parcels closed on March five for just over $36 million.
Our Northborough Crossing deal in the Boston MSA as currently under contract for $104 million is a perfect example of what we are trying to achieve with the net lease platform.
Our expectations are that we could sell up to $75 million of the center to RGMZ, resulting in a significantly reduced basis for RPT.
Consistent with our thesis regarding the value dislocation between multi-tenant and net lease properties, our effective acquisition yield on the retained multi-tenant asset could improve by up to 300 basis points after the acquisition and parcelization processes close.
For RGMZ, they get access to high-quality tenants and a location with household incomes of about $148,000 that no other triple-net investor has access to.
Additionally, we are in active contract negotiations on several other deals and have embedded a total of $100 million of net acquisitions at our pro rata share and after parcel sales to RGMZ into our guidance.
We remain optimistic that we will be able to deploy the vast majority of our current cash and future proceeds from the rest of the net lease platform seed sale by year-end, reflecting about $150 million of upside to what is currently reflected in our guidance range.
We are currently tracking a diverse pipeline of over $2 billion in markets like Boston, Atlanta, Tampa, Nashville, Miami, Jacksonville and Orlando.
Last quarter, we outlined 11 remerchandising opportunities consisting of redemising, expansions or combinations.
three other projects were also added this quarter, bringing the total in-progress pipeline to over $13 million with expected returns in the high single digits.
Troy Marketplace is a dominant power center that has maintained a high level of occupancy throughout the pandemic, was 97% leased at quarter end.
We were able to generate an 88% rent spread on the new lease.
Although the incremental return on capital is tighter than our typical underwriting, we believe that attracting a premier grocer at this already strong center will create significant value via cap rate compression of almost 200 basis points and position the asset for success for years to come.
First quarter operating FFO per share of $0.19 was up $0.01 versus last quarter, driven by our improving rent collections as we experienced a decline in rent not probable collection and abatement, which totaled $3.2 million in the quarter, down from $4.4 million last quarter.
Further, as disclosed on page 33 of our supplemental, our first quarter rental income, excluding prior year amounts, has ticked up since last quarter and is now only down 5% from first quarter of 2020 despite the continued nonpayment of our theater tenants who have remained closed since the onset of the pandemic.
Our four Regals are slated to open in late May and account for about 75% of our total theater exposure.
We continue to take a conservative stance with uncollected rents and have reserved nearly 80% of our uncollected first quarter recurring billings.
As of quarter end, $18 million of our recurring billings for the trailing 12 months remain outstanding, of which $12 million has been reserved with the majority of the $6 million balance expected to be repaid over the course of '21 and 2022.
We started 2021 on a high note, signing 62 deals in the quarter covering 556,000 square feet.
Blended rent spreads were up 9% as we achieved a 51% comparable new lease spread, our best quarterly spread in almost three years, driven by our Troy Marketplace grocery deal that Brian previously noted.
While the TI related to this deal was outsized, it was more than offset by the value of nearly $20 million that was created by cap rate compression.
Excluding this deal, our new lease spread would have been up 26%, highlighting a solid, broad-based demand and mark-to-market opportunities in our portfolio.
Our renewal spreads also continued to improve, up 3.9%, making the third consecutive quarter of improving renewal spreads.
Given our strong leasing activity, we ended the first quarter with a signed not open backlog of $3.3 million, the majority of which will come online over the next 12 months.
We also have a full pipeline of deals with over $2 million of leases in advanced legal negotiations.
In the spirit of transparency, we have outlined these active and pipeline remerchandising opportunities on page 19 and 20 of our supplemental.
Occupancy for the quarter was 90.6%, down 90 basis points sequentially due primarily to the proactive and planned recapture of our space at our Troy Marketplace and West Broward properties that will facilitate new grocer deals.
We ended the first quarter with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA of 7.2 times, down from 7.6 times last quarter.
Looking forward, we continue to target leverage in the 5.5 to 6.5 times range, which will be driven by the normalization of EBITDA as the impacts of COVID-19 reverse course in '21 and 2022, the stabilization of our portfolio and as future tranches of the RGMZ seed close in 2021.
From a liquidity perspective, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $143 million and a fully unused $350 million unsecured line of credit.
Including the expected proceeds from the remaining RGMZ seed sales, our pro forma cash balance would be about $250 million.
Regarding our pending debt maturities through 2022, we have just one $37 million private placement note that matures in June and a $52 million mortgage that is prepayable starting in November and carries an above-market 5.7% interest rate.
However, given our strong liquidity position and as an interim step, we may repay our $37 million private placement note due in June ahead of our expected refinancing.
As with any debt issuance, we look to maintain a flat maturity ladder with a goal of having no more than 15% of our debt stack maturing in any given year.
The last topic I want to touch on is our updated 2021 OFFO per share guidance of $0.81 to $0.89, which is up $0.03 at the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $0.77 to $0.87.
Also assumed in our forecast are $100 million of net acquisitions at our pro rata share.
The net impact of the initial seed sales and net acquisition activity of $100 million is expected to add $0.02 of upside relative to the midpoint of prior guidance.
The other $0.01 of upside stems from outperformance in the first quarter that we are now projecting in future periods.
And lastly, although we have $100 million of net acquisitions formally built into guidance, we believe we can deploy as much as $250 million into opportunistic acquisitions within our target markets that meet our disciplined underwriting standards, representing upside to our guidance range.
