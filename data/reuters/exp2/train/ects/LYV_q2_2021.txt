In the U.S. and U.K., we're seeing strong ticket sales, and the restart of our concerts and festivals highlighted over the past weekends by Lollapalooza and Rolling Loud in the U.S. and Latitude in the U.K. hosting 750,000 fans combined.
This was driven in part by our U.S. concert division putting the highest number of shows on sale ever during a single month, 50% more than the next highest mark back in 2019.
We expect to have over six million fans attend our festivals during the second half of the year, with about 2/3 of our festivals increasing their attendance compared to 2019.
Most of our major festivals sold out in record time, while average ticket prices have been 10% higher than 2019.
At the same time, Ticketmaster's leading-edge technology continues to attract new clients, adding 11 million net new fee-bearing tickets so far this year, already surpassing any previous full year growth.
We have structurally reduced our cost basis by $200 million, making us more nimble in converting more of our revenue to AOI.
While we expect to generate positive AOI overall and for each segment for the second half of the year, we will also reduce costs this year by over $800 million and reduce cash spend by $1.5 billion relative to pre-pandemic plans.
Revenue for the quarter was $576 million compared to $74 million in the second quarter of 2020 for growth of over $0.5 billion.
Our AOI for the quarter was $10 million compared to a loss of $432 million for the second quarter of 2020.
Our Q2 2021 AOI consisted of $351 million of contribution margin, which included $364 million from operations, along with various onetime items, including gains from insurance recoveries and government support and losses from ticketing service fee refunds paid out.
This was then offset by $341 million in operational fixed costs.
Contribution margin for the quarter was $204 million or nearly 60% of our total contribution margin, delivering $99 million in AOI.
Ticketing revenue for the quarter was $244 million or just over 40% of our total revenue for the quarter.
In general, North America drove much of this resurgence, accounting for over 75% of total transacted tickets in the quarter as compared to approximately 2/3 of transacted tickets for 2019.
Concert tickets drove much of this activity, and as a result, the top 10 artists sold over $513 million in GTV during the second quarter this year compared to $329 million in the second quarter of 2019.
For the second quarter, our concerts AOI loss of $84 million was an improvement of $127 million relative to Q2 last year, and our revenue was up $145 million relative to Q2 last year as we promoted nearly 1,700 shows for 1.3 million fans during the quarter.
More importantly, these ticket sales drove our event-related deferred revenue up to $2.1 billion, representing a pipeline of future activity even higher than the $1.6 billion we had at the end of the second quarter in 2019.
In part, this event-related deferred revenue is associated with over 25 million tickets we have sold for our concerts in the second half of this year, along with also being part of the 14 million tickets that we have already sold for concerts in 2022, which reflects strong double-digit growth in our 2022 pipeline for show count and fans relative to 2019.
Our sponsorship and advertising AOI for the quarter was $13 million and revenue was $45 million, with the bulk of our activity tied to our ticketing platform and concert presales.
As of June 30, we had total cash of $4 billion, including $1.1 billion in ticketing client cash and $1.8 billion in net concert event-related cash, leaving free cash of $1.1 billion.
Our free cash, along with $971 million of available debt capacity, gives us $2.1 billion in readily available liquidity, up from $1.6 billion at the end of 2020 and steady with our Q1 ending liquidity.
Benefiting our free cash position in the second quarter was $161 million in favorable timing, largely the result of classification of our event-related deferred revenue between short term and long term.
Our total free cash usage in the quarter was $163 million or $54 million per month, which included $115 million per month of operational burn, up from $100 million per month in the first quarter as furloughed employees returned to prepare for our reopening and we reinstated full pay for most employees, plus another $58 million per month of nonoperational cash costs, including investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions and artists and ticket client advances, to give us $173 million average per month in gross burn.
And in Q2, we had $119 million average per month cash contribution margin, double our Q1 average.
At the end of the second quarter, event-related deferred revenue for shows that will play in the next 12 months was $2.1 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter.
Ticket sales in the second quarter were nearly $900 million, while refunds totaled $100 million, and a shift to deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows that were rescheduled into the back half of 2022 totaled $150 million.
Our total capital expenditures were $52 million for the first six months, with $38 million spent on revenue-generating items.
As a result, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $170 million, with over 60% of the spend going into revenue-generating capex projects.
Our total debt as of June 30 was $5.3 billion.
And our weighted average cost of debt was 4.4%, with about 90% of that debt at a fixed rate.
