And as evidenced by our second quarter results, this company and our team of over 45,000 dedicated professionals are arising to the challenge.
In the second quarter, in the face of an unprecedented 29% decline in revenues, ITW delivered $449 million in operating income, $681 million in free cash flow and operating margins of 17.5%.
We leveraged our flexible cost structure to reduce operating expenses by more than $140 million without any centralized cost takeout mandate from corporate while providing full compensation and benefit support to every ITW team member, sustaining investments in key long-term growth strategies and positioning for full participation in the recovery.
As we outlined during our first quarter earnings call, we have an integrated 4-pronged strategy for managing the company through the pandemic: protect and support our people, continue to serve our customers with excellence, maintain our financial strength and strategic optionality and win the recovery.
And indeed, organic revenues declined an unprecedented 27%.
At the enterprise level, total revenues declined 29% as organic revenues declined 27%, and foreign currency and last year's divestitures further reduced revenues by about one point each.
Nevertheless, our businesses still generated $449 million of operating income and delivered resilient operating margin performance of 17.5%, with operating expenses down more than $140 million and enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis points.
As expected, free cash flow was strong at $681 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and 213% of net income.
Q2 cash flow performance did benefit from the delayed timing of U.S. income tax payments of $158 million, which were paid in the third quarter.
The balance sheet and our liquidity remained strong throughout the containment phase as we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash on hand, essentially no short-term debt, no commercial paper, a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier one credit ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.3 billion.
As you can see, the demand contraction was global as North America declined 26%, Europe was down 37% and Asia Pacific was down 7%.
On a positive note, China was up 1% after being down 24% in Q1 as the early phase of their recovery began to take hold.
It is also notable that five of seven segments delivered operating margins above 20% despite organic revenue declines ranging from 9% to 25%.
Overall, organic revenues were down 53% year-over-year, although we did see a significant uptick in June that is continuing in July.
North America was down 62%; Europe, down 59%; and China was the bright spot with organic revenue up 6%.
Also, as expected, the second hardest hit segment was Food Equipment as organic revenue declined 38%.
North America organic revenue was down 33% and international declined 44%.
Equipment sales were down 38% and service was down 37%.
Institutional sales, including healthcare facilities and hospitals were slightly more resilient, down about 30%.
And not surprisingly, restaurants, QSR were down about 45%.
Relatively speaking, sales to grocery retail customers held up better, down only 14%, with some equipment orders being pushed out due to COVID concerns, and retail service sales were flat with prior year.
Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue declined 11%, with Test & Measurement down 12% and Electronics down 9%.
And despite negative volume leverage, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.7% with excellent cost management and enterprise initiatives as the main contributors.
In Welding, demand slowed significantly as organic revenue declined by 25% with equipment sales down 28% and consumables down 21%.
Industrial end markets declined 40% while commercial end markets were fairly resilient, down only 11%.
That said, despite a 29% decline in revenues, Q2 operating margin was 21.6%.
Polymers & Fluids organic revenue was down 14%.
Polymers was down 20%, in line with industrial and MRO trends.
Auto Aftermarket was down 14%, with retail sales improving in a meaningful way as stores opened back up as the quarter progressed.
Fluids had the best performance, with organic revenue down only 5% helped by product sales into health and hygiene end markets.
Operating margin was up 30 basis points to 23.1%, driven by enterprise initiatives and strong tactical cost management.
Moving to Slide 10.
Construction organic revenue was down 9% with North America, which is almost half the segment, up 1%, with double-digit growth in the residential renovation market served through the home center channel.
This strength was partially offset by a 21% decline in the North America commercial business and internationally as Europe was down 28%, reflecting a more restrictive quarantine protocol.
Australia and New Zealand sales were down only 3%.
Specialty organic revenue was down 16%, with North America down 15% and the international side down 19%.
So let's move to Slide 11 for an update on some full year 2020 performance scenarios.
And while we're not providing formal guidance as we sit here today, we are tracking closest to the mid scenario, with second half organic revenues down about 12%, which would translate into a full year organic decline of approximately 14.5% and operating margins of 20% to 22%.
And in an unprecedented year like this, should this scenario hold, we would still make somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion of operating income and generate more than $1.8 billion in free cash flow.
As a result, we expect an increase in working capital and, therefore, lower free cash flow of about $600 million in the second half of the year.
We currently project that we will spend about $60 million in restructuring projects in the second half of the year, including $45 million of 80/20 front-to-back projects that were already planned for 2020 that we placed on a temporary hold as the early stages of the pandemic unfolded.
As a reference, we spent about $80 million on restructuring in 2019 and about $30 million of that was in the second half of the year.
It is worth noting that the average payback for these projects is projected to be less than 12 months.
In that regard, core to the recovery planning process in every one of our 84 divisions is the identification and actioning of specific pandemic-related share gain programs and opportunities that are aligned with our long-term enterprise strategy.
In the last quarter, we landed new programs worth a combined $105 million annually with a handful of key customers based largely on our ability to provide immediate supply.
Just recently, one of our businesses was awarded nearly $10 million in new business as a result of one of their key customers moving to build more local supply capability.
As just one illustration, in the second quarter, our new patent filings were up 24% over last year.
