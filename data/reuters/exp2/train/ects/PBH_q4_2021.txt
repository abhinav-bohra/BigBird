Full year gross margin came in at 58%, essentially flat to last year on an adjusted basis.
Adjusted earnings per share grew nearly 10%, achieving the high end of our long-term expectations as we continued to benefit from our operating model, leading financial profile and ongoing debt reduction.
Adjusted free cash flow of $213 million also grew versus the prior year and continues to fuel our disciplined capital deployment efforts.
Each brand won significant market share during fiscal '21, outpacing category growth by five, 15 and seven percentage points respectively.
This drove double-digit category declines and a 500-plus basis point headwind to our full year sales performance.
A final highlight to make that helped drive fiscal '21 results was e-commerce, which now represents about 11% of revenue.
Q4 revenue of $237.8 million declined 5.4% and 6.6% on an organic basis versus the prior year, which excludes the effects of foreign currency.
By segment, North America revenues were down approximately 4%.
International OTC declined approximately 24% in Q4 after excluding the effects of foreign currency.
earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.79 per share, down $0.03 versus the prior year as lower interest expense from debt pay down and lower share count only partially offset the decline in revenues versus year ago.
For the full year fiscal '21, revenues declined 2.4% versus the prior year in constant currency.
Total company gross margin of 58% was approximately flat to last year's adjusted gross margin of 58.3%.

Advertising and marketing came in at 14.9% for the fiscal year.
Following an unusual Q1 related to COVID-19, A&M returned to normalized levels of spend of approximately 14% to 16%.

G&A expenses were just over 9% of sales in fiscal '21 versus the prior year, owed largely to disciplined cost management.
For the upcoming year, we anticipate G&A expenses to approximate just over 9% of sales.

As of March 31, we finished the year with approximately $1.5 billion in net debt and a leverage ratio of 4.2 times.
During the year, we reduced debt by $250 million and opportunistically repurchased $12 million in shares during the year, enabled by our strong generation and cash position entering the year.
As a result, we were able to issue $600 million of new senior notes during the quarter, which replaced prior notes that were due in 2024.
The transaction both extended a key debt maturity to 2031 and resulted in annual interest savings of over $15 million.
As a result, interest expense for fiscal '22 is expected to be approximately $60 million.
For the full year fiscal '22, we anticipate revenues of approximately $957 million to $962 million, including organic revenue growth of 1.5% to 2%.
This revenue outlook assumes our portfolio continues to generate approximately 2.5% long-term organic revenue growth, partially offset by certain categories like cough cold, which we expect to remain flat to fiscal '21.
We anticipate earnings per share of $3.58 or more for fiscal '22.
We anticipate free cash flow of $225 million or more.
