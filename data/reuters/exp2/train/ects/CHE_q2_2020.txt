Before we begin, let me remind you that the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
Operating two separate and distinct service business segments with 17,000 employees during a national pandemic brings unique, unpredictable and abrupt challenges.
We closely followed the myriad of federal, state and local regulations in the development and implementation of infrastructure necessary to safely allow our field, support and corporate support staff to safely limit as much as practical, physical interaction among our 17,000 employees.
On the VITAS segment, the federal government and specifically HHS and CMS have been exceptionally supportive in terms of relaxing regulations, allowing the use of telehealth capabilities where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our 19,000 plus patient census.
On April 10, 2020, VITAS without application received $80.2 million of CARES Act funds, that was formulaically determined by the federal government based on our 2019 Medicare fee-for-service revenue.
The ability of VITAS to retain and utilize the full $80.2 million from the relief fund will depend on the magnitude, timing and nature of the economic impact of COVID-19 within VITAS, as well as the guidelines and rules of the relief fund program.
This financial support is material for VITAS in maintaining its operational capacity at the safely care for our 19,000 patients.
This disruption did materialize in our second quarter 2020 admissions declined 3.8% over the prior year.
Our April 2020 admissions were challenging and had a decline of 6.6%, may improve slightly with admission decline of 5.8%.
June showed significant improvement generated in admissions growth of 1.1%.
As a reminder, historically, commercial services represented approximately 28% of Roto-Rooters consolidated revenue.
This is reflected in our monthly performance with Roto-Rooter and unit-for-unit commercial revenue declining 38.6% in April, improving slightly to 31.8% decline in May and declining 19.7% in June.
Our residential services have proven to be exceptionally resilient, with our unit-for-unit residential revenue declining a modest 1.6% in April, increasing 11.7% in May and 18.7% in June.
All this translated into Roto-Rooter -- I mean unit-for-unit basis, having the second quarter 2020 commercial revenue declining 29.1%, residential revenue increasing 10.4% and Roto-Rooter consolidated unit-for-unit revenue declining a modest 1.6% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Including acquisitions Roto-Rooter generated consolidate revenue -- consolidated revenue growth of 8.6%.
Roto-Rooter's adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2020 totaled $46.8 million, an increase of 20.7%.
The adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, which is a 269 basis point increase when compared to, I'm sorry, excuse me.
I'm very appreciative of the hard work, creative solutions and willingness of our 7,000 employees to adjust our operational routines and embrace new procedures.
VITAS' net revenue was $327 million in the second quarter of 2020, which is an increase of 4.7% when compared to our prior year period.
This revenue increase is comprised primarily by 2.8% increase in days of care, a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase, including the suspension of sequestration on May 1 of 2020 of approximately 5.4% and acuity mix shift, which reduced the blended average Medicare rate increase by approximately 310 basis points.
The combination of increased Medicare Cap and a decrease in Medicaid net room and board pass-throughs, as well as reductions in other contra revenue activity, reduced total revenue growth in additional 42 basis points in the quarter.
Our average revenue per patient per day in the second quarter of 2020 was $194.02, which including the impact from acuity mix shift is 2.3% above the prior year period.
Reimbursement for routine home care and high acuity care averaged $165.22 and $985.23, respectively.
During the quarter, high acuity days of care were 3.5% of our total days of care, 69 basis points less than the prior year quarter.
This 69 basis points mix shift and high acuity days of care reduce the increase in average revenue per patient per day from 5.4% to 2.3% in the quarter.
VITAS accrued $5.8 million in Medicare Cap billing limitations and then second quarter of 2020.
This $5.8 million of Medicare Cap, includes approximately $2.3 million of cap liability attributed to the pandemic.
The suspension of sequestration resulted in additional 2% increase in reimbursement effective May 1 of 2020.
In Medicare, provider numbers that we're in a Medicare cap liability situation, there is 2% reimbursement increase was effectively eliminated by a corresponding increase in Medicare cap liability in those markets.
The second quarter 2020 gross margin excluding Medicare Cap increased cost for personal protection equipment or PPE disinfecting facilities and increased costs for additional paid off or PTO for our front-line employees was 27.2%, which is a 352 basis point margin improvement when compared to the second quarter of 2019.
Roto-Rooter generated quarterly revenue of $175 million in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $13.9 million or 8.6% over the prior year quarter.
Roto-Rooter generated revenue of $158 million for the second quarter of 2020 a modest decline of 1.6% over the prior year quarter.
Total Roto-Rooter commercial revenue, excluding acquisitions, decreased 29.1% in the quarter.
This aggregate commercial revenue decline consisted of drain cleaning revenue decreasing 31.2%, commercial plumbing and excavation declining 28%, and commercial water restoration declining 20.3%.
Total residential revenue, excluding acquisitions increased 10.4%.
This aggregate revenue growth for residential consisted of residential drain cleaning increasing 10.2%, plumbing and excavation expanding 14.4% and commercial water restoration increasing 4.3%.
Roto-Rooter's gross margin in the quarter was 51.2%, a 247 basis point increase when compared to the second quarter of 2019.
As of June 30, 2020 Chemed had total cash and cash equivalents of $20.4 million and no long-term debt.
With that said, revenue growth for VITAS in 2020, prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be in the range of 5% to 7%.
Our Average Daily Census in 2020 is estimated to expand approximately 2% to 4%.
And our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 19% to 20%.
We are currently estimating $17 million for Medicare Cap billing limitations for the calendar year 2020.
We also anticipate the $80.2 million of CARES Act funds that Chemed just -- Kevin described earlier that our formulaically calculated by the federal government based upon our 2019 Medicare fee-for-service revenue will be adequate to cover our increased costs specifically related to operating our healthcare unit during the pandemic, as well as any incremental Medicare Cap billing limitations that are triggered from declines in Medicare admissions.
Roto-Rooter is forecasted to achieve the full year 2020 revenue growth of 9% to 10%.
Adjusted EBITDA for Roto-Rooter for 2020 is estimated to be in the range of 23% to 25%, Based upon this discussion, our full-year 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding non-cash expense for stock options, tax benefits from stock options, cost related to litigation, CARES Act funds used for lost revenue and other discrete items is estimated to be in the range of $16.20 to $16.40.
This 2020 full year, calendar year guidance assumes an effective corporate tax rate of 25.2% and as a comparison Chemed's 2019 reported adjusted earnings per diluted share were $13.96.
All of this enabled us to care for 19,185 patients each day within the quarter, while bringing on the service 16,822 patients who needed high quality hospice care during this pandemic.
As I mentioned in the second quarter, our average daily census was 19,195 patients, an increase of 2.8% over the prior year.
Total admissions in the quarter were 16,822.
This is a 3.8% decline in admissions when compared to the second quarter of 2019.
In the second quarter, our admissions increased 7.1% in our home-based preadmit locations.
However, this admission group -- admission growth was more than offset by the combination of hospital admissions declining 4%, nursing home management's decreasing 22.8% and assisted living facility admissions declining 10.2% when compared to the prior year quarter.
Our average length of stay in the quarter was 90.9 days.
This compares to 91.1 days in the second quarter of 2019, in 90.7 days in the first quarter of 2020.
Our median length of stay was 14 days in the quarter, which is two days less than the 16 day median in the second quarter of 2019 and equal to the first quarter of 2020.
