For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
We reported fourth-quarter revenue of $106.7 million, an operating margin of 39% and net income of $1.05 per share.
For the full year, we had revenue of $301 million, an operating margin of 15% and net income of $0.45 per share.
Our quarterly revenue was up 20%, and earnings per share was up 133% from the same period last year.
For the full year, our revenue was down 14%, and earnings per share was down 68%.
With respect to costs, our compensation ratio for the year was 59%, slightly above our target level as a result of lower revenue for the year.
For the quarter, the compensation ratio was an unusually low 42% in order to offset unusually high ratios in the first two quarters of the year.
Our non-compensation operating expenses for the quarter were $21 million, which was $3.7 million higher than the same period last year due to some foreign currency-related losses compared to gains the prior year along with a charge for an uncollectible account receivable from a client in financial difficulty.
Our effective tax rate was 33% for the quarter and 40% for the year.
We continue to expect a rate generally in the mid-20% range going forward.
During the quarter, we purchased 1.5 million shares and share equivalents at an average price of $15.98 per share.
For the full year, we purchased 3.8 million shares and share equivalents at an average price of $18.04 per share.
For 2020, our Board has authorized $60 million in purchases of shares and share equivalents, which compares to $69 million we spent for such purchases during 2019.
In the quarter to date, we have repurchased 345,723 shares of common stock at an average price of $16.47 per share for $5.7 million in total, meaning we have repurchase authority of $54.3 million left for the remainder of the year.
We also declared a quarterly dividend for the quarter of $0.05 per share.
We ended the year with cash of $114 million and debt of $365.6 million, meaning we had net debt of $251.6 million.
As of yesterday, our cash balance was up to $133.9 million despite the incremental share repurchases in January with the debt amount unchanged.
In the past year, we added a net five client-facing managing directors, such that we have 79 today, and we increased our total professional headcount by 11%.
Our brand for high-quality and independent advice has been built over decades of client service, and our team collectively owns 48% of the economic value of our firm through common stock and restricted stock and is, thereby, highly incentivized to generate strong results and create value for all shareholders.
