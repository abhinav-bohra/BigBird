On Slide 2 is the safe harbor statement.
Moving to Slide 5, West is uniquely positioned to satisfy increasing market demand by leveraging our global operation of scale and our resources.
And now turning to Slide 6, the disruption caused by the pandemic has impacted the way all of us conduct business in our daily lives.
So, turning now to Slide 7 and our performance in the third quarter, our financial results remain strong.
And we've had over 18% organic sales growth in the third quarter, driven again by robust high value product sales, as well as sales in contract manufacturing.
Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16 to 20.
We recorded net sales of $548 million, representing organic sales growth of 18.2%.
COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $32 million in the quarter.
Excluding net COVID impact, organic sales grew by approximately 11%.
Looking at Slide 9.
Proprietary product sales grew organically by 20.3% in the quarter.
High-Value Products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double-digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q3.
We recorded $194.6 million gross profit, $46.8 million or 31.7% above Q3 of last year.
And our gross profit margin of 35.5% was a 310 basis point expansion from the same period last year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $103.9 million recorded this quarter, compared to $70.1 million in the same period last year for a 48.2% increase.
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 19% was a 360 basis point increase from the same period last year.
Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 46% for Q3.
Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.02 in Q3, earnings per share grew by some 53%.
On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter.
Volume and mix contributed $77.1 million or 16.9 percentage points of growth, including approximately $32 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand.
Sales price increases contributed $6.1 million or 1.3 percentage points of growth, and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $8.7 million or a reduction of 1.9 percentage points.
Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 35.5% for Q3 2020, up from 32.4% in Q3 2019.
Proprietary products third-quarter gross profit margin of 40.8% was 260 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019.
Contract Manufacturing third-quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% was 350 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019.
On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
Operating cash flow was $323.8 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $63 million, compared to the same period last year, a 24.2% increase.
Our year-to-date capital spending was also $116.7 million, $27.9 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.
Working capital of $790.6 million at September 30, 2020 was $73.5 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Accounts Receivable due to increased sales activity and inventory, mainly as a result of increasing safety stock.
Our cash balance at September 30 of the $519.4 million was $80.3 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results.
Turning to guidance, slide 13 provides a high-level summary.
Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.1 billion and $2.11 billion.
This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of also approximately $85 million.
There is an estimated headwind of $4 million based on current foreign exchange rates.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 14% to 15%.
This compares to prior guidance of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion and growth of approximately 12%.
We expect our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $4.50 to $4.55, compared to prior guidance of $4.15 to $4.25.
Capex guidance remains at $170 million to $180 million.
Estimated FX headwinds on earnings per share has had an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates.
The revised guidance also includes $0.18 earnings per share impact from tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
Our sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct or approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.
Before I close, I'm pleased to share that last evening we received FDA clearance for West to market our 20 millimeter Vial2Bag advanced product.
