For the first nine months of 2020, net income, again excluding investment gains and losses was $1.50 per diluted share, which was up 10.3% from 2019.
Consolidated net premiums and fees earned grew by roughly 6.5% during the third quarter and 6% for the first nine months of the year.
This growth was primarily fueled by our Title operation, as it reported strong 17% growth for both this year's third quarter, as well as on a year-to-date basis.
Net premiums earned for the General Insurance Group were relatively flat in 2020 compared to the same periods a year ago, posting an approximate 1% decline in both 2020 periods.

On a consolidated basis, this reduced the reported claim ratios for the current quarter and year-to-date periods by 1.5 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points respectively.
Approximately three-quarters of the portfolio is invested in bonds and short-term investments, remaining 25% is allocated to equity securities, primarily large cap companies that have a long history of paying and steadily increasing dividends.
Further improvement in financial markets resulted in a third quarter rise in the valuation of our equity portfolio by roughly $79 million.
At September 30th, the equity portfolio reflected an unrealized gain of $412 million.
And as of yesterday's close, the portfolio had rebounded by an additional $100 million.
The retention of earnings in excess of dividends paid in combination with increases in the fair value of investments during the quarter contributed to the book value per share reaching $20.39 at the end of the quarter net, inclusive of dividends paid is a 4.7% increase from June.
One positive development is that the business has returned to operating profitability, which totaled $4.5 million for the third quarter and $8 million on a year-to-date basis.
During the third quarter, delinquencies declined by 4.4%.
And another positive note is that the proportion of delinquent loans in forbearance increased to 47% of the total, up from 41% at June.
From a capital perspective, the mortgage companies' statutory capital at the end of September totaled roughly $424 million.

The overall combined ratio improved from 97.7% to 95.5% in the quarter and improved from 97.1% to 96.5% year-to-date.
The claim ratios we reported were inclusive of prior year favorable development of 0.8 percentage points in the quarter and 0.5 percentage points year-to-date.
Again compared to the 2019 third quarter, net premiums earned in commercial auto grew by 1%, while net premiums written grew by 6%.
Our third quarter commercial auto claim ratio improved to 80.4% compared to 85.6% in the same period of 2019.
Turning to workers' compensation, compared to the 2019 third quarter workers' comp net premiums earned and written both fell 11% reflecting reduced exposure base, as payrolls have not rebounded certainly not to the extent that we saw with commercial auto exposures.
The workers' compensation [Technical Issues] ratio came in at 54.1% compared to 55.4% in the third quarter of 2019.
They continue to behave as we discussed following the first and second quarters with 95% of our COVID-19 workers' compensation claims coming from loss sensitive business, such as large deductibles.
And then separately 95% of the COVID-19 claims continue to be very mild in nature with very low claim payment, with less than 1% of the claim severe or fatal.
So for the three of those coverages combined, the commercial auto work comp and general liability, the third quarter claim ratio came in at 72% as compared to 73% in last year's third quarter.
As Karl reported earlier, total premium and fee revenue was up approximately 17% for both the quarter and year-to-date.
Our pre-tax operating income of $103 million for the quarter compared to $73 million in last year's third quarter, an increase of $30 million or 41.5%.
Year-to-date, pre-tax operating income of $212 million compares to $154 million in the prior year-to-date period, an increase of $58 million or 37.9%.
Year-to-date 2020, our combined ratio of 91.2% compares favorably to the 92.9% reported for the comparable 2019 period.
As with past challenges, we will rely on the same guiding principles of integrity, managing through the long run, financial strength, protection of our policyholders, and the well-being of our employees and customers that have served us well for over the last 10 or plus years.
