Some major producers have suggested the chip and electronic component shortages could extend 12 or even 18 months.
It's very similar to our approach to ventilator allocation during the peaks of the COVID crisis these last 18 months.
2 player to our No.
1 leading market position in almost all of the 140 countries that we compete in worldwide.
This news from our competitor was only released to the market on June 14, so we are in the first 7.5 weeks of our response.
Based upon our latest supply chain information and analysis, we see a path to $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022, over and above our previously planned revenue growth for fiscal 2022.
Our experience over the last seven-plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%.
They can drive their own patient adherence rates up to over 87% and beyond.
And yes, during the near distant future, we will be starting the full product launch of our brand-new next-generation platform called AirSense 11.
But there is a wide variance in that total patient flow from 75% of pre-COVID levels in some countries around the world to 95% or even 100% of pre-COVID levels in other countries.
We will continue to support frontline respiratory therapists and physicians, as well as providers, patients and our ResMedian team throughout the 140-plus countries that we operate in.
This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID-related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter and with some tailwinds from our competitors' recall right at the end of the quarter.
While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year, with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal-year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit, and all the while, fighting for recovery of patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts.
Quite a performance from our team of 8,000 ResMedians, helping people in 140 countries.
During the quarter, we generated over $227 million of operating cash flow, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders these last 90 days.
Today, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend for shareholders to $0.42 per share.
We lead the field of remote patient engagement and population health management with over 15 million cloud-connectable medical devices in the market.
We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium- and long-term value with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio, including over 8,200 patents and designs.
We now have over 9 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions.
We have over 16.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution for physicians.
This new myAir 2.0 release supports our next-generation platform called AirSense 11.
The AirSense 11 platform comes to the market with new capabilities, with improved data delivery, with scalable architecture and with support for full-cycle teams.
We have over 110 million patients managed within our Software-as-a-Service network for out-of-hospital care.
Last quarter, we previewed our next-gen platform called AirSense 11.
Responding to the current industry situation, our market-leading research and development team accelerated the launch of the AirSense 11.
This AirSense 11 device launch will be a device launch like no other in the history of ResMed.
Our market-leading AirSense 10 continues to be very strongly adopted, and we believe that it is better than any other device currently on the market.
In short, it makes sense to continue to sell the AirSense 10 at scale, particularly as this will help maximize the overall CPAP, APAP and bi-level volume available for our customers for sale given the unprecedented demand for new patients to receive ResMed devices in the market right now.
The bottom line is that we're gonna be selling both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 in parallel for quite some time as we meet this extraordinary market demand over the coming fiscal year and as we continue to expand the availability of AirSense 11 to new markets and new geographies around the ResMed world.
We are very excited to bring the AirSense 11 to market.
AirSense 11 benefits patients and bed partners, and the device and software platform combination will also benefit physicians, providers, payers and overall healthcare systems.
All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud-connectable with upgraded digital health technology to increase patient engagement and adherence, to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within our customers' own healthcare systems, engaging patients directly in their own digital therapy like never before in the industry.
Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide.
We announced that our respiratory care business benefited this time last year in the June 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilation devices and mask solutions to meet the growing demand for COVID on an acute scale to the tune of $125 million in sales.
They were under $20 million in sales, just under.
We are balancing the growth in demand with the supply of ventilators that made it to market throughout the last 18 months as customers balance their inventory with ongoing acute and chronic ventilation patient needs.
Our mission and specific goal to improve 250 million lives through better healthcare in 2025 drives and motivates ResMedians every day.
With over 1.5 billion people around the world suffering from sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, we see incredible opportunities for greater identification, enrollment and engagement of people within our digital health ecosystem.
We are relentlessly driving innovation and development to provide the scale needed to expand the impact of this technology across all of the 140 countries that we operate in.
Before I hand the call over to Brett for his remarks, I want to again express my sincere gratitude to the more than 8,000 ResMedians for their perseverance, hard work and dedication during the most unusual, almost perfect storm of circumstances.
You have helped save the lives of many hundreds of thousands of people around the world with emergency needs for ventilation these last 18 months as we suffered through COVID.
