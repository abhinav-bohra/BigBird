The sale impacted our third-quarter average results by approximately $800 million and $3.3 billion on an ending basis.
Compared to the prior quarter, average loans were down 0.7%.
Adjusting for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio, our loans were up approximately $100 million on average and up over $1 billion on an ending basis.
Adding to the comments on our core loan growth, adjusting for both the indirect auto loan sale and PPP loans our linked quarter total loan growth would have been 4.3%.

Our net interest margin was 2.47% for the third-quarter 2021, compared to 2.62% for the same period last year and 2.52% for the prior quarter.

We had a record third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $235 million driven by broad-based growth across the platform, including strong M&A fees.

Compared to the second quarter, noninterest income increased by $47 million.
I'm now on Slide 10.
We total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.112 billion, compared to $1.037 billion last year and $1.076 billion in the prior quarter.
The quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses was primarily driven by two areas: the first, personnel expense related to one additional day of salary expense in the quarter and slightly higher employee benefits; the second was an increase in other expense of $18 million, largely related pension settlement charge and higher charitable contributions.
Now moving to Slide 11.
For the third quarter, net charge-offs were $29 million or 11 basis points of average loans.

Of the 593 million in common share repurchases, $468 million were related to the initial settlement of our accelerated share repurchase program, representing 80% of the $585 million authorization.
The remaining $125 million were purchased in the open market.
The remaining 20% of the ASR will be settled in the fourth quarter.
On Slide 13, similar to prior years, we provided guidance for the fourth quarter relative to our third-quarter results.
We expect our net charge-offs to be below 20 basis points for the fourth quarter.
And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate has remained unchanged at 20%.
