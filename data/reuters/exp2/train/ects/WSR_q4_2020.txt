What we have witnessed, however, is in the real estate industry 10 years of this Freshman was condensed into 10 months.
In the second quarter, we collected 81% versus an industry average of 73%.
In the third quarter, we collected 90% versus the industry average of 88%.
And in the fourth quarter, we collected 95% versus the industry average of 93%.
We are pleased to see the continued upward trend and are happy to announce 96% collections for the month of January.
And our leasing spreads were quite strong, as we ended the year with blended leasing spreads of 8.9% for new and renew leases.
We have maintained levels between 88% and 90% and ended the fourth quarter with an occupancy level at 8.2%, roughly just 2% below Whitestone's 2019 year-end occupancy.
We consider the upside of bringing our occupancy into the 90% to 95% range, very doable.
With minimal tenant bankruptcies, another example of the sustainability of our tenant mix is we have less than 0.5% of our Annualized Space Rents, ABR are only six out of almost 1,400 tenants that are in bankruptcy.
A December article by S&P Global highlighted, Whitestone's number one ranking, for the shopping centre industry in foot traffic recovery on Black Friday with an 81% year-over-year recovery.
This far outpaced the industry average of only 48%.
It also supported and confirm, our internal research using third-party artificial intelligence software that showed over 80% year-over-year recovery at the properties for the entire month of November.
With the strength, stability and predictability of our cash flows, we continue uninterrupted payouts for now going on 126 consecutive months.
First, we increase the dividend, most recently our Board decided to raise the dividend by 2.4%.
Second, we repaid the $30 million of COVID borrowings.
Again, I reiterate that the strength of our operations have mitigated the need for our precautionary $30 million drawdown of our credit facility availability during COVID.
By year end, we had repaid the entire $30 million of borrowings and strengthened our balance sheet.
99% of our businesses are open as of year end.
We eagerly anticipate getting back to our growth value add strategy that includes our $250 million of internal intrinsic value opportunities, and $500 billion of an external acquisition pipeline prospects, with a proven model, stronger platform with greater financial flexibility, and a leaner, more cohesive team to scale our business.
Our occupancy has been impacted, but only by about 2%.
Despite having a significant amount of our tenant businesses impacted, we only had a handful of tenants close for good, such that the portfolio occupancy rate held up well, ending the year at 88.2%, down 2.1% from last year, or approximately 100,000 less least square feet, representing the net loss of only nine tenants year over year.
Also, our annualized base rent per square foot at the end of the quarter was $19.43 and $19.58 on a cash and straight line basis.
This represents a 1% decrease on both a cash and straight line basis from a year ago.
The change on a straight line basis is largely related to the conversion of 102 tenants to cash basis accounting and the associated write-off of accrued straight line rents.
During 2020, the impact to funds from operations from these cash basis conversions was approximately $3.5 million $0.08 per share.
At year end, we have 54 tenants on a cash basis, representing 4.2% of our gross leasable area and 4.6% of our annualized base rent.
Cash basis tenants paid 65% of contractual rents in the fourth quarter, up from 63% in Q3 and 41% in Q2.
Our square foot leasing activity was 10% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 and our blended leasing spreads on new and renewal leases on a GAAP basis was a positive 8.9% for the year.
As Jim mentioned, for the quarter, we collected 95% of our rents.
Our deferred rents for the quarter were 2.6% of our total contractual billings.
Funds from operations core was $0.24 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.93 per share for the full year.
Same-store net operating income was 4.2% lower for the quarter and 4.4% lower for the full year.
The impact on FFO core for the quarter and year from incremental COVID reserves was approximately $0.02 and $0.13 respectively.
All of our tenant categories were above 90% collections in Q4, with the exception of fitness, representing 4% of our revenue at 82% and entertainment, representing only 2% of our revenue at 48%.
Our largest tenant categories, restaurants, grocery, and financial services were at 96%, 99%, and 99%, respectively.
At year end, we had $23 million in accrued rents and accounts receivable, broken down the components of the $23 million consists of $16.3 million of accrued straight line rents and other receivables, $20.7 million of billed receivables, $2.2 million of deferred receivables, offset by a bad debt reserve of $16.4 million.
Since the beginning of the year, our billed receivable balance has increased $4 million and our deferred receivables have increased $2.2 million for a total billed and deferred receivable balance increase of $6.2 million.
Against this increase, we have recorded and uncollectible reserve in 2020 of $5.6 million or 90%.
Our liquidity representing cash and availability on our corporate credit facility stands at $44 million at year end, down only 6% from $47 million at year end 2019.
During the fourth quarter, we paid off all COVID-19 liquidity borrowings, and our total net real estate debt is down $12 million from a year ago.
Currently, we have $131 million of undrawn capacity, and $18 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility.
