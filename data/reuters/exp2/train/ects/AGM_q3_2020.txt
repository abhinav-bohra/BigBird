In evaluating Farmer Mac, you should consider these risks and uncertainties as well as those described in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February as updated in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC today.
Core earnings were a record $27.7 million, reflecting an 18% year-over-year growth.
Net effective spread was 96 basis points in the third quarter and 92 basis points year-to-date, a modest increase compared to prior periods as we benefited from excellent funding and asset liability management and we're beginning to see a shift in the composition of our portfolio toward some higher spread loan purchase products.
Since March, we have approved 465 payment deferral --deferment requests from borrowers related to COVID-19 that was through October 30th, and that's with a total principal balance of $454 million or 1.7% of total outstanding credit.
As of October 15th, $4.6 million of Farm & Ranch COVID deferments have been repaid in full, and another $153.3 million and that's compared to that $454 million of Farm & Ranch deferments or 35% of loans deferred have ended their deferral period and they are not delinquent.
Turning to business volume, we provided $1.3 billion in new credit to rural America in the third quarter of 2020.
However, maturities and repayments in our Institutional Credit line of business and net pay-downs of loans under long-term standby purchase commitments modestly outpaced new business this quarter, and our outstanding business volume decreased by $52 million from the second quarter to just under $22 billion at quarter end.
We provided $741 million in gross new Farm & Ranch loan purchases in the third quarter and $1.8 billion year-to-date.
This compares with $761 million in the first nine months of 2019.
As Brad mentioned, business volume modestly decreased $52.8 million to $22.0 billion in the third quarter of 2020.
It is important to note that a driver of our quarterly volume decrease reflects continued decreases in certain pass through securitization and off balance sheet products, specifically long term standby purchase commitments and loans held in trusts of a combined $177.6 million.
Turning to our on-balance sheet loan purchase products, net volume growth was up $480.3 million during the quarter driven by significant growth in our core loan purchase products in Farm & Ranch, USDA Securities and rural infrastructure.
The sequential quarter and year-to-date growth rates in net loan purchases in these lines of business were 5.6% and 20.3% respectively.
This strong net volume growth overcame a large decrease in AgVantage securities of $335.3 million, which I will discuss in more detail later.
Loan purchase net volume growth in our foundational Farm & Ranch line of business was $399.5 million during the quarter, over three times greater than the same period in 2019 and as Brad mentioned, the single quarter exceeded the net volume growth during the first three quarters of 2019 combined by over $160 million.
On a year-to-date basis, loan purchase net volume growth in our Farm & Ranch line of business was $905.3 million compared to $239.0 million in 2019.
The consistent growth we've seen in Farm & Ranch loan purchases over the last 12 months reflects the success of our customer acquisition and retention initiatives, our ability to provide competitive interest rates across our product set and our efficient and effective execution in the loan approval and purchase process.
Additionally, our strong business volume growth over the last year has outpaced the broader agricultural credit markets, specifically Farmer Mac's agricultural mortgage loan portfolio grew 21.1% over the last 12 months compared to the year-over-year growth rate of the total agricultural mortgage loan market of approximately 3.5% through June 2020.
As Brad mentioned, the team completed a milestone for Farmer Mac this quarter completing a $15 million syndication of a newly purchased $59.2 million agricultural loan.
Turning to our USDA Securities line of business, we achieved record gross loan purchase volume this quarter of $225 million resulting in net volume increase of $73 million.
The year-to-date net volume growth of $188.9 million reflects our focus on customer acquisition and retention strategies, the consistent and reliable liquidity, we're able to provide and the increased USDA loan limits authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill.
Net loan purchases in our Rural Utilities line of business increased modestly by $7.8 million during the quarter, reflecting $62.3 million in new loan purchases offset by scheduled amortization and maturities.
As part of our renewable energy project finance strategic initiative, Farmer Mac purchased a $10 million loan in connection with a wind project financing.
Our Institutional Credit line of business experienced a net decrease of $335.3 million during the quarter.
I'm proud to say, we recently launched the doubling of the eligible loan size that sellers can offer their borrowers for our AgXpress scorecard product from $750,000 to $1.5 million.
Improving consumer spend and increases in inventories helped to boost inflation adjusted third quarter U.S. gross domestic product or GDP at historic pace of 33.1% on an annualized basis.
The strong quarter put the U.S. on track to close the year approximately 4% below 2019 levels, according to data released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the national unemployment rate improved to 6.9% in October and continuing unemployment claims fell across 49 states in the four weeks leading up to their October 16th data release.
U.S. consumers continue to spend at food and beverage stores at levels 10% above 2019 levels.
The USDA distributed over $10.3 billion in direct payments to farmers and ranchers from June to October through its first Coronavirus Food Assistance Program or CFAP1 and the small business administration has distributed more than $8.1 billion in paycheck protection program or PPP loans to businesses involved in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting.
In September, USDA announced a second round of CFAP payments and through October 25th, the USDA has distributed an additional $7.6 billion in payments across the country of their allocated $14 billion set aside for this program.
Loans past due by 90 days or more increased in the third quarter of 2020 to 1.07% of the outstanding Farm & Ranch portfolio or 0.4% across all four lines of business.
The increase is typical of the seasonal patterns and scheduled loan payments as most loans have a July 1st payment due date and the end of our third quarter marks 90 days from that payment date.
Individual loan risk ratings held steady in the third quarter of 2020 with substandard loans totaling $326 million across all loans and guarantees.
This volume is spread across 50 different commodities and over 200 counties in 38 states.
We continue to maintain spreads in the range of 90 basis points plus or minus a few basis points.
We remain well capitalized with strong liquidity and maintained a total cash position of over $900 million as of September 30th.
You will also note that we've enhanced our capital position once again this quarter through the issuance of $120 million of non-cumulative perpetual Series F preferred stock.
We used $60 million of the net proceeds to redeem the outstanding non-cumulative Series A preferred stock that had been outstanding.
This issuance strengthened our Tier 1 capital position, which increased in total by 83 basis points going from 13.42% to 14.25% and positions us well for our various growth initiatives, but also buffers us in case of unforeseen stress.
Due to the timing of the preferred stock issuance, Farmer Mac incurred dividends on both Series A and Series F preferred stock for 30 days during the third quarter and recognized deferred issuance costs of $1.7 million related to the redemption of the Series A preferred stock.
Turning to financials, core earnings increased $4.3 million to $27.7 million for third quarter 2020 as compared to $23.4 million in third quarter 2019.
Our net effective spread was $51.8 million in third quarter 2020 compared to $42.5 million in the same period last year.
Net effective spread in percentage terms of 96 basis points this quarter exceeded our previously disclosed target range of plus or minus 5 basis points of 90 basis points, and this is primarily due to a decrease in funding cost and from higher spread business volume.
The increase in core earnings was primarily due to a $7.4 million after-tax increase in net effective spread and this was partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in preferred stock dividends, a $0.8 million after-tax increase in operating expenses and a $0.5 million after-tax increase in the total provision for credit losses.
Operating expenses increased by 7% in third quarter 2020 compared to third quarter 2019.
The provision this quarter for loan losses of $1.2 million was largely attributable to continued net growth in the rural utilities portfolio and credit downgrades in the Farm & Ranch long term standby purchase commitment portfolio.
Turning to our sequential results, our core earnings increased by $1.3 million on an after-tax basis, compared to second quarter 2020.
This increase was driven by higher net effective spread of $4.2 million after tax, and this was partially offset by $0.9 million after-tax increase in the total provision for credit losses, a $1.2 million increase in preferred stock dividends, and a $0.4 million after-tax increase in operating expenses.
Farmer Mac's $984 million of core capital as of September 30th, 2020 exceeded our statutory requirement by $314 million or 47%.
This compares to $916 million of core capital as of June 30th, which exceeded our statutory requirement by $248 million or 37%.
This brings our Tier 1 capital ratio to 14.25% from 13.45%, an increase of 83 basis points from the prior quarter.
The increase in capital from the prior quarter is primarily due to the previously mentioned issuance of Series F preferred stock as well as a $10 million increase in retained earnings in the third quarter of 2020.
More complete information about Farmer Mac's third quarter 2020 performance is in the 10-Q we filed today with the SEC.
We have generated consistent, strong core earnings against not only a tough COVID backdrop, but also amid an investing environment with benchmark interest rates around the world at near 0%.
