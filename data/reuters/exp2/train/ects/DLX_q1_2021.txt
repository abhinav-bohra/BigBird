Additional information about factors that may cause our actual results to differ from projections is contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and in other company SEC filings.
Revenue was $441 million with a rate of decline on a year-over-year basis of 9%, a meaningful sequential improvement over the fourth quarter decline of nearly 13%.
Adjusted EBITDA margin improved nearly 340 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%.
Adjusted earnings per share improved nearly 17%.
Free cash flow improved 47% year-over-year to $18 million.
We closed more than 1,600 deals, including the single largest win in Deluxe history with financial services leader, PNC, as well as the significant deal with TD Bank.
We closed 20 deals with ACV over $1 million each.
And the top six deals had a combined ACV of over $50 million.
Since we started our One Deluxe sales approach over six quarters ago and including a recent win which was signed in April, we have closed nine of the 13 largest deals of the last decade and two of the largest in company's history.
Our success and our now proven strategy put us in the position to announce the largest acquisition in the company's 106-year history, First American Payment Systems, which is expected to close later in this current quarter.
The transaction will expand our payments business by adding merchant services to our product offering and will double the size of the Payments segment to approximately $600 million with 20% plus adjusted EBITDA margins and strong growth rates.
Our Q4 earnings call and again at the First American payment transaction call on April 22, I confirmed we had met all 5.
In Cloud, aside from PNC, which will also benefit our Promotional Solutions segment, key wins include another top 50 financial institution, where we will deliver full end-to-end campaign management services for its branch transformation initiatives.
Excluding these impacts, the cloud rate of decline was about 10% or just over half of the reported rate, and sequentially before the business grew 5%.
Importantly, adjusted EBITDA margin improved over 600 basis points year over year, which Keith will also touch on in a moment.
We posted total revenue of $441.3 million.
While this is a decline of 9.3% as compared to the same period last year, importantly, it was a 360 basis point improvement in the rate of decline experienced in the prior quarter.
We reported GAAP net income of $24.3 million in the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.6% to $90.5 million and adjusted EBITDA margin improved nearly 340 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%.
Consistent with our expectations shared on the fourth quarter call, Payments grew Q1 revenue 3.2% year-over-year to $79.5 million.
Payments also grew nearly 2% sequentially from the fourth quarter.
The quarterly performance was led by our treasury management business, which grew 4% year-over-year.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.7% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was 23%, down 40 basis points as product mix impacted gross profit rates versus the prior year.
And as such, we are assuming adjusted EBITDA margins will remain in the low 20% range through the year.
On a GAAP basis, revenue declined 18.2% year-over-year to $62.2 million in the quarter, but increased 5% sequentially from Q4.
8% of the year-over-year decline was due to the impact of exits and divestitures and revenue benefited from additions in the data-driven marketing business.
In Q1, cloud's adjusted EBITDA margin improved over 800 basis points versus prior year, driven by expense alignment to post-COVID operating model targets and improved mix related to our prior year business exits.
We expect cloud margins to remain healthy in the low to mid-20% range.
Promotional Solutions first quarter 2021 revenue was $124.5 million.
While down 12.8% year-over-year, the sequential rate of decline improved 380 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.2%, up 640 basis points due to year-over-year reductions in SG&A expenses.
Checks first quarter revenue declined 8.1% from last year to $175.1 million due to anticipated secular trends compounded by the impact of the pandemic.
The rate of decline did improve 180 basis points sequentially from Q4 despite severe weather impacts, clearly signaling to COVID recovery.
First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin levels continue to be strong at 47.7%.
We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $427.7 million, including $125.4 million of cash.
During the quarter, the amount drawn under the credit facility was unchanged from the year-end and remained at $840 million.
Resulting net debt decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter, ending the quarter at $714.6 million, the lowest level in nearly three years.
Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operating activities plus capital expenditures, was $17.9 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $5.7 million or 46.7% improvement compared to last year.
Our Board approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share on all outstanding shares.
As a result and on a stand-alone basis, without the impact of First American, we are reiterating our guidance for full year 2021 revenue growth of 0% to 2% and full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of 20% to 21%.
We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $90 million as we continue with important transformation work, innovation investments and building future scale across our product categories.
We also continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 25%.
We sat in the past 2.5 years preparing Deluxe to reenter the M&A market by improving our technology, reorganizing our sales structure and strategy, expanding our product set, building out our management team and strengthening our balance sheet.
