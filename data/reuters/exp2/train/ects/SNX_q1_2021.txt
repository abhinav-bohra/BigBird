This transaction is valued at $7.2 billion, including net debt; and at close, SYNNEX will issue 44 million shares.
Pro forma ownership will be 55% SYNNEX shareholders and 45% Tech Data shareholders.
From a financial perspective, the combined company will be on very solid footing with pro forma revenue of $57 billion, healthy earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flow generation.
We expect the transaction to be accretive to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by more than 25% in year one.
From a cost perspective, we expect to realize $100 million of net synergies in year one, and $200 million in year two.
It will consist of a $1.5 billion term loan A and $2.5 billion of unsecured bonds at varying maturities, bolstered by a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which we expect to be undrawn at close.
The expected cash balance at close will be approximately $1 billion.
The expected leverage ratio of approximately 2.7 times at transaction close is expected to decline to approximately 2 times within 12 months.
With the combined entity generating LTM pro forma adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion, this will provide us with ample ability to de-lever quickly while also remaining focused on optimizing the core and driving organic growth.
