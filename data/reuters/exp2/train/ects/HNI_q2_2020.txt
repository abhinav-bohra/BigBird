First, we are restoring salaries to their pre-pandemic levels, 60 to 90 days earlier than initially anticipated.
Orders in domestic Workplace Furnishings, excluding our e-commerce business, were down 36% in Q2.
Over the past five weeks, they are down 33%.
E-commerce orders were up 114% in Q2 and up 87% over the past five weeks.
Residential Building Products orders were up 2% in Q2, and we continue to see positive growth rates over the past five weeks.
Consolidated non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.20.
That was down from the $0.38 we reported in the second quarter of 2019.
Second quarter consolidated organic sales decreased 21.2% versus the prior year.
Including the benefit of acquisitions, sales were down 20.6%.
Consolidated non-GAAP operating income declined $9.4 million versus prior year on a sales decline of $109 million, which means our deleverage rates or decremental margin was 8.6%.
That's well below our targeted range of 25%, which includes the benefits of cost actions.
In the Workplace Furnishings segment, first quarter sales decreased 24.8% year-over-year.
Despite the top line pressure, we were able to generate $7.8 million of non-GAAP operating income in the segment.
While that is down from the $19.7 million in the prior year quarter, the decremental margin was only 11%.
Sales in our Residential Building Products segment decreased 8.6% year-over-year organically and 6.1% when including acquisitions.
Within the segment, new residential construction revenue declined 5% organically, and sales of remodel and retrofit products were down 15% year-over-year.
Operating profit totaled $14.4 million compared to $13.4 million in the prior year period, and operating margin was 13.1%, up from 11.5% in the second quarter of 2019.
For HNI, overall, second quarter gross profit margin was 36.1%.
This is down 50 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to volume.
Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was 32.5%.
At the end of the second quarter, we had $183 million in total debt, which was down $47 million from the first quarter and was $103 million lower than the prior year quarter.
Our gross leverage or gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8.
This remains well below the 3.5 times gross leverage covenant in our existing loan agreements.
From a net debt perspective, our leverage ratio of 0.7 is down from 0.8 last quarter and 1.2 in Q2 of last year.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $54 million, more than double the $23 million we generated in the second quarter of 2019.
We expect to reduce year-end net debt below last year's level, and we project free cash flow will be significantly above our $52 million dividend.
Third, we continue to believe 25% is the appropriate deleverage or decremental margin estimate over time.
As a result, we expect decrementals to be in the range of 20% for the full year 2020.
