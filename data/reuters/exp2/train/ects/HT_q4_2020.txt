January started off stronger than we anticipated for our portfolio returning to greater than $60 RevPAR with South Florida and Washington DC offsetting lock downs on the West Coast and the Northeast.
Most corporate accounts anticipate returning to at least 50% of pre-COVID travel by the end of 2021 and more than 40% of these accounts expect a full recovery in corporate travel by 2022.
This portfolio of hotels is about 25% of our pre-pandemic EBITDA, had a weighted average occupancy nearing 40% and realized ADR growth of 2% for the full year 2020.
Across the country in Key West the Parrot Key Hotel and Villas was our best performing asset during the fourth quarter, generating 55% occupancy and 8.4% year-over-year ADR growth to $306 for the period.
The holiday weeks were especially strong, most notably the period between Christmas and New Year's which had greater than 90% occupancy and saw ADR exceed 2019 levels at the hotel.
Our largest asset the Cadillac Hotel and Beach Club on Miami Beach is seeing increased demand on weekends entering special events, generating occupancies approximating 90% with rate on pace to improve incrementally throughout the balance of the quarter.
The Ritz Carlton Georgetown was able to hold a $1,000 ADR for the peak nights for the few leisure guests in town.
One of our better performing markets during the fourth quarter from our forecast perspective was our New York City portfolio, finishing the quarter with close to 40% occupancy, which came in spite of having few leisure oriented attractions open in the city.
These customers, the New York Fire and Police Departments and a few medical groups continue to get rest at the new hotel Brooklyn and the Hampton Inn Seaport resulting in January occupancy of 97% and 51% respectively.
It may not actualize as high as 25% as some of predicted, but the confirmed closures in 2020 alone provide a concrete realism that the supply will contract.
Our goal is to generate $150 million to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales to pay down our senior credit facility.
The 6 recently announced asset sales will generate net proceeds of approximately $191 million.
Many of these hotels represented those with capital intensive projects on the horizon and the successful completion of these sales will lower our capex budget by approximately $20 million over the coming years.
We transacted at a discount to pre-COVID value, but we focused our sales on mature hotels, hotels that we don't for nearly 10 years, hotels that would require additional capital investment during the recovery, and the slowest growth hotel in each of our geographic clusters.
We were also pleased to announce last week and fund just yesterday our strategic financial commitment with affiliates of Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank providing a $150 million unsecured term loan, which can be expanded to $200 million.
Amazon announcing the addition of 3,000 jobs in the Boston Seaport, walking distance from our Envoy Hotel.
Last week, we announced a strategic financing commitment with affiliates of Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank to provide a $150 million in unsecured notes, which can be upsized to $200 million at any point on or before September 30th of this year with a maturity date on the notes of February of 2026.
This capital is unsecured and fully subordinated to our bank facility and allows us to defer cash interest on 50% of our financing for the first year, creating substantial near-term cash savings and providing us additional runway during this period of recovery.
Last week, we also highlighted that we went under contract to sell two additional hotels, bringing our year-to-date total asset value of disposition to $178.5 million.
The successful closing closing of these sales in addition to the Sheraton Wilmington, which closed in December and the Duane Street Hotel, which is expected to close during the second quarter will generate total proceeds of $216 million, and following the repayment of the $25 million mortgage loan on the Capitol Hill Hotel net proceeds from these dispositions will amount to approximately $191 million, which we will utilize in tandem with the proceeds from our unsecured notes to pay off our 2021 term loan and reduce our overall debt by approximately $150 million.
With the resulting reduction of overall leverage and the payment in current feature of our unsecured notes we estimate that our cash interest expense will decrease by approximately $4 million in 2021, and that our total interest expense including the deferred interest from the notes will remain similar to our 2020 interest expense.
We completed these asset sales and closed on the unsecured notes placement contemporaneously with the amendment of our revolving credit facility, and we're very pleased with the continued support from our consortium of over 15 Bank group members.
Results at our properties of incrementally improved over the past 6 weeks and ultimately led to the validation of our breakeven forecast during January, in what is seasonally the slowest month of the year our properties generated positive property-level cash flow during the month of January on 40% occupancy with RevPAR levels 60% below January of 2020.
In January, 20 of our 36 operational hotels broke even on the GOP line with 14 achieving EBITDA breakeven level.
These results represent a 75% increase and 40% increase in properties that broke even on the EBITDA line compared to November and December respectively.
Based on January's results and our forecast for the first quarter, we are comfortable with our previous estimates that the entire portfolio breaks even at property level with GOP with a 60% RevPAR decline.
At the corporate level, our RevPAR breakeven occurs at a 40% decline.
The model affords flexibility to continue to operate in current staffing levels at our breakeven occupancies approximating 30% up to 55% to 60% at some of the hotels.
As occupancies increased at our hotels we are seeing flow throughs as high as 70% on the GOP line, and as we push both rate and occupancy we anticipate maintaining them for the remainder of the year.
Our total property-level cash burn for the fourth quarter was $5.9 million and in January the property generated property-level cash flow for the first time since March of last year.
Corporate cash burn of $4.3 million in January represents a 60% reduction compared to April of 2020 at the depths of the crisis.
As you may recall, following our 2016 transaction where we sold a majority of this portfolio and in which we netted a gain of $213 million, we retained a subordinated minority interest in the portfolio, which was junior to thin debt to equity position.
We removed these 7 hotels from our portfolio count and they will no longer be part of our operating results after the first quarter.
We ended the 4th quarter with $23.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and deposits.
During the quarter we received $8.1 million dollars in business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Irma's impact on our South Florida portfolio, and these receivables had a positive impact on our AFFO performance in the quarter.
We spent $4.3 million on capital projects last quarter, bringing our 2020 spend to $26 million, approximately $15 million below our forecast at the beginning of the year.
Our 2021 capex load will be primarily focused on maintenance capex and life safety renovation, and we anticipate it will be roughly 35% below our 2020 spent.
As we have very minimal capex moving forward after the $200 million we have spent on capital projects since 2017 and the recent disposition of lower growth, higher cost hotels our portfolio will experience very little disruption or capital spend for the coming years.
These actions increased our weighted average debt maturity to 3.6 years and resulted more than 88% of our debt being either fixed or swapped.
