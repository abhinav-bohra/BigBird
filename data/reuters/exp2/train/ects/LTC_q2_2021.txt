Over the last 25 weeks, SNF have seen occupancy rise in each week except one, when census remained flat.
Additionally, there is about $25 billion remaining for distribution to all healthcare providers in the Provider Relief Fund.

It has been LTC's practice to support a dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% of FAD.
As a result, of the financial support we have provided some of our operators and the significant senior lifestyle and senior care defaults our second quarter 2021 dividend payout ratio was 98%.
Total revenue increased $9.6 million compared with last year's second quarter resulting primarily from a $9.5 million increase in rental revenue, which was due to a $17.7 million write-off in last year's second quarter related to Senior Lifestyle straight-line rent and lease incentive balances.
The increase in revenue was partially offset by reduced rent from senior lifestyle net of rent received from releasing 11 properties in the portfolio defaulted Senior Care lease obligations, abated and deferred rent and a decrease in property tax revenue.
Interest income increased $113000 from the prior year due to the funding of expansion and renovation projects offset by scheduled principal pay downs.
Interest expense decreased by $686000 due to scheduled principal paydowns on our senior unsecured notes lower interest rates and a lower outstanding balance under our line of credit partially offset by lower capitalized interest in 2021.
Property tax expense decreased $311000 compared with last year's second quarter as a result of the timing of certain operators property tax escrow receipts and the payment of related taxes partially offset by completed development projects.
G&A was $757,000 greater than last year due to the timing of accrual for incentive compensation salary increases and restricted stock vesting.

During the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a net gain on sale of real estate of $5.5 million related to the sale of three properties in Wisconsin and a closed property in Nebraska all previously leased to Senior Lifestyle.
The lease has a five-year term and provides a purchase option for $5.5 million, which is exercisable after the first year of the lease.
Cash rents starting in the second year of the lease is $150,000 increasing to $300,000 in the third year and escalating 2% annually thereafter.
Net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2021, increased by $16.4 million primarily due to the senior lifestyle write-off in the prior year and the gain on sale of the three Wisconsin properties this year.

In annualized adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.3 times and a debt to enterprise value of 29%.
We expect to see this 5.3 ratio come down as we receive more rent from assets formerly operated by Senior Lifestyle and eventually we expect to be able to collect rent from assets involved in the most recent senior care bankruptcy.
