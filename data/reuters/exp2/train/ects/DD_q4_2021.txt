Our 2020 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.
Our fourth quarter results are highlighted by 6% volume gains, including a 9% increase in the E&I segment and a 12% increase in W&P.
Customer demand was broad-based across the portfolio, led by greater than 20% volume growth in semiconductor technologies and high teens volume growth in Water.
Our top-line performance also reflects significant pricing actions we took to offset $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter.
We are taking additional actions as we work to offset logistics costs, which, during the fourth quarter, were a $50 million headwind, mostly in W&P.
Turning to Slide 3, I will provide an update on our portfolio transformation and will review how our focus on those strategic actions, balanced capital allocation, and innovation-led growth position us extremely well heading into 2022 to continue unlocking value for our shareholders, innovating for our customers, and creating opportunity for our employees.
Combined with Laird, these acquisitions increase the total addressable market of our E&I business by approximately 50% and will deepen our penetration into markets such as electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and industrial technologies.
A lot of work has been done to plan for the cost synergies associated with the Rogers acquisition, which we expect to be approximately 150 million.
We also have line of sight to about 63 million of cost synergies from the Laird acquisition from last summer, which is ahead of our target.
Today, we announced that our board has approved a 10% per share increase to our dividend, which is consistent with our commitment for a dividend payout in the range of 35% to 45% and to grow the dividend annually in line with earnings.
In addition, our board has also authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program, which enables us to continue returning value to our shareholders as we expect to complete the remaining 375 million under our existing authorization in the first quarter, ahead of the planned expiration.
We will also generate strong cash flow this year in addition to the 240 million gross proceeds from the biomaterials divestiture, which is the last of our non core divestitures.
The 6% volume growth we delivered in the quarter and 10% volume growth for the year benchmarks well against our top peers.
For the quarter, our volume gains, excluding M&M segment, were up 10%.
In addition, we have solid cash flow generation and returned over 650 million in capital to shareholders during the quarter through 500 million in share repurchases and over 150 million in dividends.
For the year, we returned more than 2.7 billion in cash flow to shareholders, 32.1 billion in share repurchases, and 600 million in dividends.
Turning to Slide 4.
Net sales of 4.3 billion were up 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2020, up 13% on an organic basis.
Organic sales growth consists of 7% price gains, reflecting the continued actions we are taking to address inflationary pressure and 6% volume growth.
A 2% portfolio tailwind reflects the net impact of strong top-line results related to our acquisition of Laird and headwind from non core divestitures.
Currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter.
From an earnings perspective, we reported fourth quarter operating EBITDA of 973 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 per share, up 5% and 54%, respectively, from the year-ago period.
Net of these impacts, our incremental margin was about 33% in 4Q.
Ed mentioned earlier the pricing actions that we took throughout the year, resulting in us offsetting about 250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter.
The raw material inflation, coupled with about 50 million of higher logistics costs in the quarter, were headwinds to our margins.
From a segment perspective, E&I delivered 10% operating EBITDA growth on volume gains and earnings uplift from Laird, which more than offset raw material and logistics segments, as well as start-up costs associated with our Kapton capacity expansion.
In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 7% as pricing gains and volume growth more than offset higher raw material and logistics costs.
M&M operating EBITDA declined 3% as net pricing gains were more than offset by lower equity earnings due to higher natural gas costs in Europe.
In the quarter, cash flow from operating activities was 621 million and capex was 184 million, resulting in free cash flow of 437 million.
Free cash flow conversion was 100%.
In addition, we received gross proceeds of about 500 million during the quarter from our Clean Technologies divestiture, which was closed at the end of December.
Full year net sales of 16.7 billion grew 16% and were up 14% on an organic basis.
The organic growth consists of a 10% increase in volume and a 4% increase in price.
The 10% increase in volume for the year consists of gains in all three reporting segments and within all nine business lines, reflecting robust global customer demand in secular growth areas, such as electronics and water, along with recovery in end markets negatively impacted by the pandemic in prior year, such as automotive, commercial construction, and select industrial markets.
Full year operating EBITDA of 4.2 billion increased 21%, reflecting 1.3 times operating leverage, operating EBITDA margin expansion of about 100 basis points, an incremental margin of 32%.
Full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.30 per share was up about 95% from prior year on higher segment earnings, a lower share count, and lower interest expense.
Slide 5 shows the impact that price cost inflation had on our operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter.
In total, pricing actions fully offset about 250 million of raw material inflation, which was higher than our expectations for input costs coming into the quarter and mainly in the M&M segment.
While our pricing actions have enabled us to maintain earnings, the price cost inflation resulted in a significant headwind of about 150 basis points to operating EBITDA margins versus the year-ago period.
Additionally, higher logistics cost of about 50 million in the quarter resulted in a margin headwind of about 120 basis points.
Offsetting the headwinds from raws and logistics was a 70 basis-point improvement in operating EBITDA margin, which includes volume growth in E&I and W&P and the benefit associated with the Laird acquisition.
If you exclude the price cost and logistics headwinds in the quarter, on an ex-M&M segment basis, our operating EBITDA margin was above 26.5% in the fourth quarter, further illustrating our strong performance and putting an emphasis on our planned portfolio actions.
Turning to Slide 6, which provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in the net sales for the quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, organic sales growth of 13% during the quarter consists of 7% pricing gains and 6% volume growth.
In E&I, volume gains delivered 9% organic sales growth for the segment, led by higher volumes in semiconductor technologies of more than 20%.
For W&P, 17% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of a 12% increase in volume, including volume gains in all three businesses, and 5% pricing gains.
Year-over-year pricing gains of 5% during the quarter relate primarily to actions taken in safety and shelter in response to raw material inflation and also reflect sequential price improvement from all three business lines within W&P versus the third quarter.
For the full year, W&P delivered 10% organic sales growth on 8% volume improvement and 2% pricing gains.
For M&M, 13% organic sales growth during the quarter was driven by a 16% increase in price, offset slightly by a 3% decline in volumes.
The 60% local price increase during the quarter reflects continued actions taken to offset higher raw material and logistics costs.
For the year, M&M organic sales growth was 24% on 12% higher volume and 12% pricing gains.
All three business lines within M&M delivered organic sales growth of greater than 20% for the full year.
Turning to Slide 7.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 per share was up 54% from $0.70 per share in the year-ago period.
For full year 2022, we expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%.
Let me close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 8.
In 2022, we are planning that raw material and logistics costs will remain at elevated levels with approximately 600 million of year-over-year headwinds versus 2021, primarily in the first half.
In the first quarter, we expect net sales between 4.2 billion and 4.3 billion and operating EBITDA between 940 million and 980 million.
For the full year, net sales of 17.4 billion to 17.8 billion and operating EBITDA of approximately 4.4 billion at the midpoint reflects volume growth and acceleration of additional pricing gains throughout the year to offset the impact of both raw material and logistics cost increases.
We delivered 6% volume growth well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter.
