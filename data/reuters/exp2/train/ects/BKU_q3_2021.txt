Information on these factors can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and any subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K, which are available at the SEC website www.
It's 18 months into it.
Quickly getting into our quarter, we posted net income of $87 million or $0.94 a share.
This compares to $104 million we posted last quarter, which was $1.11 per share.
The annualized returns so far for the 9 months so far -- our return on equity is 12.4% and return on assets of 1.09%.
Net interest income declined slightly to $195 million from $198 million last quarter, but it was up compared to the third quarter of last year, which I think at that time, it was $188 million.
The net contracted 2.33% from 2.37%, mostly because of lower asset yields and less than expected commercial loan growth.
We dropped at 20 basis points this quarter.
It was 25 last quarters so 5 basis point reduction in the cost of deposits.
On a spot basis, we're actually at 19 basis points and I checked last night, we're down another basis points so like 18 basis points as of yesterday.
We also had decent growth in deposits especially DDA -- non-interest DDA grew by $324 million.
In fact one of the things the Board did yesterday when we met is approved another $150 million buyback given that we are going to wind down the authorization that we have based on how quickly we bought stock this quarter.
Also, the fact that the stock was around $40 or so makes it very easy in my -- from my perspective given where our book value is we're trading at such a low multiple so easy.
Loans -- Total loans excluding PPP runoff, they grew by $74 million.
Those have been disappointed [Phonetic] this quarter, which is why it all adds up to only about $74 million of growth in the loan portfolio.
So I'm happy to report on the credit front criticized classified assets declined by $240 million.
Loans under temporary deferral or modified under the CARES Act also declined to $285 million.
They were $497 million I believe at end of last quarter, so almost cut in half.
It was 1.21% this quarter.
Last quarter, it was 1.28%.
So if you exclude that NPL ratio, it's actually 99 basis points.
The $69 million large commercial loan that we spoke to you about last quarter, it's the resolution of that is moving forward.
Net charge-offs annualized was 19 basis points.
Last year, I think we were at about 26 basis points.
Capital, book value has grown to $34.39, tangible is at $33.53.
So as Raj said, average non-interest bearing deposits grew by $749 million for the quarter and $2.7 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Period-end non-interest bearing DDA grew by $324 million, while total deposits shrank by $493 million.
So we break down a little bit the $324 million of NII DDA growth for the quarter, it was again broad spread across all geographies, across all business units and very heavily focused on new client acquisition.
I'd also spend a little bit of time working on the deposit portfolio, the work that Raj is talking about is, has been a daily level of kind of bruising work that's not that glamorous but we're working very hard on new account operating relationships, cross-selling within the book, ensuring the ECR rates are set at appropriate levels really working hard on kind of the building blocks of this and I think the two places that you see it, number one, are the continued NII DDA growth obviously in the $324 million, but also secondarily, if you look at service charges, deposit fees on accounts was up 33% for this quarter compared to the same period last year.
A little further down, money market accounts declined by $1.1 billion this quarter as we continue to execute the strategy of the quality of the base.
Switching to the loan side, as Raj said, excluding PPP loans, the total portfolio grew by $74 million in the third quarter.
The overall resi portfolio grew by $751 million for the quarter.
Of that, the EBL segment was $50 million and the pure residential correspondent portfolio grew by $701 million.
In the mortgage warehousing business, which is also benefited from a strong housing market, there we saw a decline of $141 million for the quarter.
For the C&I business, it was up $13 million for the quarter, including owner occupied CRE loans and I'll talk a little bit more about what we see in that the segment.
The largest decline was in CRE including multifamily, which was down by an aggregate of $317 million for the quarter.
The New York multifamily portfolio, which you have been following now with us for a number of years, declined by $76 million for the quarter.
As for PPP, $159 million of the First Draw PPP loans were forgiven in Q3.
As of September 30, there was a total of $49 million in PPP loans outstanding under the First Draw program and $283 million of outstanding under the Second Draw program.
Slide 16 in the supplemental deck also provides more detail on this.
$244 million of commercial loans remained on modified terms under the CARES Act, compared to $436 million at June 30.
The largest decline in loans modified under the CARES Act was $144 million decline in the hotel portfolio.
Today, $414 million in commercial loans have rolled off modification.
100% of these loans have either paid off or resumed regular payments from residential perspective excluding the Ginnie Mae early buyout portfolio $40 million of loans remained on short-term deferral or have been modified under the longer-term CARES Act prepayment plan at September 30.
Of the $533 million in residential loans that were granted an initial payment deferral $493 million or 92% of rolled off.
Of those that have rolled off, 95% have been paid or are making regular payments.
I think the last thing I'd say on the loan portfolio is also when we look at the $74 million in growth, keep in mind that we had $175 million of payoffs in in criticized and classified loans.
The NIM did decline this quarter to 2.33% from 2.37%.
The yield on loans decreased to 3.45% from 3.59% last quarter, recognition of PPP fees, the differential in that quarter-over-quarter if it hadn't been for that the yield on loans would have declined by only 6 basis points for the quarter and most of that 6 basis points really was attributable to the shift from residential to -- from commercial to residential.
There are still $8.1 million worth of deferred fees on PPP loans remaining to be recognized almost all of that $8 million relates to the Second Draw program.
Yield on securities declined from 1.56% to 1.49% and accelerated prepayments, which we think some day has to come to an end but keeps not coming to an end.
The total cost of deposits declined by 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
The cost of interest bearing deposit is down 6 basis points.
With respect to the allowance and the provision, overall, the provision for credit losses for the quarter was a recovery of $11.8 million.
Slide 9 through 11 of our deck provide further details on the ACL.
The ACL declined from 77 basis points to 70 basis points over the course of the quarter.
Most significant drivers to that change, $2.3 million decrease related to the economic forecast.
This is becoming less impactful than it has been in prior quarters, which is not surprising as things start to stabilize, a $4.5 million decrease due to charge-offs, another $3.7 million due to a variety of changes in the portfolio, including the mix of new production and ad bids [Phonetic], the further shift to loan segments with lower expected loss rates primarily residential impact on PDs of an improving borrower financial performance, risk rating changes, etc, and a $5.9 million decrease in the amount of qualitative overlays and this is mainly just a shift things that are now being captured by the models.
Remind you that almost 20% of the resi both this government insured and actually carries no reserve.
With respect to risk rating migration, if you see -- you can see some details on this in Slides 23 through 25 of our deck, the total criticized and classified commercial loans declined by $240 million this quarter, most of that within the substandard accruing category, which declined by $252 million.
Total non-performing loans decreased $277 million this quarter from $293 million at June 30.
On the year-to-date basis, we had initially guided to mid single digit increase in non-interest expense and that's the looks like where we're going to -- likely going to land by the end of the year and I would also note the 33% year-over-year increase in deposit service charges and fees, which Tom mentioned and we're pretty happy about that.
Last point I'll make, you'll see in the next couple of weeks, we'll be filing an S-3, a Shelf registration, we don't read anything into that that you all don't feel like you need to call me, our Shelf registration is expiring and we just want to have an active shelf on file.
