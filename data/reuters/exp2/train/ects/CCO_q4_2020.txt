It's worth noting that the out-of-home industry has consistently accounted for 5% to 6% of global advertising spend, and was one of the only growing traditional mediums pre-COVID.
Longer term, the digital out-of-home sector is projected to grow at 13% compound annual growth rate from 2022 to 2025, according to data published by MAGNA Global in December 2020.
We hope to capture a significant share of this growth, and we believe the actions we've taken during the past 12 months from strengthening our liquidity and implementing cost restructuring efforts, to the adjustments we've made to our sales approaches, to the continued expansion of our digital platform and data analytics product, put us in a stronger position to return to revenue growth as the recovery ultimately takes hold.
This includes the recent refinancing of a portion of our debt through the issuance of $1 billion senior notes, which extended our maturity profile and reduced our cash interest expense going forward.
We delivered consolidated revenue of $541 million, down 27% compared to the prior year.
Excluding China and FX, the decline would have been 25% in the fourth quarter, an improvement over the third quarter.
We believe this reflects both the premium locations of our roadside inventory, as well as the success of our digital screens which generated close to 70% of our fourth quarter revenue in the UK.
Based on the information we have as of today, we expect Americas segment revenue to be down in the high 20 percentage range as compared to the prior year.
Due to this, for the first quarter of 2021, with the Europe segment revenue to be down in the mid 30% range, as compared to prior year.
In the Americas segment, while year-over-year revenue was down 25%, we continue to show a sequential improvement, which was better than expected.
As a reminder, in 2019 National revenue was up 9%.
We've built a robust set of SSP partners and a rich network of more than 20 DSPs, providing avenues to sell our inventory alongside other digital media.
Europe's fourth quarter revenue, adjusted for foreign exchange, was down 23%.
During the quarter, we continued to benefit from our strategic focus on roadside locations, which accounted for about two-thirds of our total European revenue and are far less affected by COVID-19 driven restriction than the transit environment which has historically accounted for just over 10% of our European revenues.
As I mentioned, we expect the Americas to be down in the high 20 percentage range as compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, in last year's first quarter, Americas segment revenue was up 8.5% on 2019.
We added seventeen new digital billboards in the fourth quarter for a total of 74 new digital billboards in 2020, giving us a total of more than 1,400 digital billboards across the United States.
So advertisers can now understand how each of our display impacts more than 100 B2B audience segment, making targeting the B2B customer more accessible and measurable.
The brand reported that the campaign was responsible for 65% of website traffic and achieved a take through rate that was twice the industry average.
As we noted last quarter, the 12 year deal is the largest airport advertising contracts in the US, panning JFK, LaGuardia in Europe, and Stewart Airports.
As I noted earlier, we expect Europe revenues to be down in the mid 30 percentage range as compared to 2020.
The Disney Plus campaign is for the many theories one division and targeted in 18 to 45-year-old demographics with interest in comic, cinema and video games.
And the CaixaBank campaign was for their Young ID products and targeted 14 to 30-year-old with interest in music, museums and other cultural locations in Barcelona.
We added 545 digital displays in the fourth quarter and 1,244 in 2020 for a total of over 16,000 screens now live.

National was down 27% and accounted for 37% of total revenue, with local down slightly less at 24%, accounting for 63% of revenue.
Direct operating and SG&A expenses were down 16.8%, due in part to lower site lease expenses related to lower revenue and renegotiated fixed-site lease expense, as well as lower compensation costs from lower revenue and operating cost savings initiatives.

Latin American revenue was $15 million in the fourth quarter, down $11 million compared to the same period last year.
Direct operating expense and SG&A from our Latin American business were $15 million, down $4 million compared to the fourth quarter in the prior year due in part to lower revenue, as well as cost savings initiatives.
Latin America adjusted EBITDA was $1 million, down $6 million compared to the fourth quarter in the prior year due to the impact on revenue from COVID 19, partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
Now moving to Slide 8, and review of capital expenditures.

For the full year, total CapEx was $124 million, down $108 million compared to the full year 2019.
Now on to Slide 9.
Clear Channel Outdoor's consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $785 million as of December 31st, 2020.

Our weighted average cost of debt was reduced from 6.8% in 2019 to 6.1% in 2020.
Moving on to Slide 10.
In our Americas segments we completed our restructuring plans in the fourth quarter and we expect annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $7 million to begin in 2021.
In conjunction with and in addition to these plans, we expect an additional annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $5 million in our corporate operations.
Additionally, as I mentioned in my remarks on both the Americas and Europe segments, we continue to work on negotiating fixed-site lease savings and have achieved $28 million in rent abatements in the fourth quarter for a total of $78 million year-to-date.
Also, we received European government support in wage subsidies in response to COVID 19 of $1 million in the fourth quarter and $16 million year-to-date.
Moving onto our financial flexibility initiatives, earlier this month we successfully completed an offering of $1 billion of 7.75% senior notes due 2028.
Proceeds from the offering will be used to redeem $940 million of our 9.25% senior notes due 2024, as well as to pay transaction fees and expenses including associated call premium and accrued interest.
In addition, we've de-risked our maturity profile by refinancing approximately half of our 9.25% notes which were unsecured and represent our next nearest material maturity.
Our weighted average maturity is now 5.6 years, up from 4.9 years with a run rate cash interest savings of approximately $10 million per year, due to lower coupon rate.
Turning to Slide 11 and our outlook for the first quarter of 2021.
As William mentioned, Americas first quarter 2021 segment revenue is expected to be down in the high 20% range as compared to the prior year.
With the first quarter of 2020 when revenue increased 8.5% over the prior year, as well as the continued impact of COVID 19.
In our Europe segment we expect revenue to be down in the mid 30% range in the first quarter, historically the first quarter of the year is the smallest quarter for revenue.
Additionally, we expect cash interest payments in 2021 of $362 million and $335 million in 2022.
