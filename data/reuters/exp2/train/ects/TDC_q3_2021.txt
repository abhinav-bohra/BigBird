Importantly, our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased approximately five percentage points versus last year and is now approaching 80%.
In the third quarter, our public cloud ARR was $148 million.
This was a substantial 83% growth rate over Q3 of 2020.
We have already completed transactions that more than cover the $7 million that we expected in Q3, and we have closed most and are confident, we will close all of these transactions in the fourth quarter.
Just one recent example of a seamless migration to the cloud is American Airlines, a Teradata on-prem customer for more than 14 years.
Our quarterly trend of healthy net expansion rates in the cloud continues to be greater than 130%, as customers add more use cases, more data and workloads and more users to their Teradata multi-cloud portfolio platform.
Its Teradata platform is core to its critical business applications, supporting more than 2,000 users for many different business initiatives, including regulatory reporting, customer analytics, product profitability and responsible lending.
We released a significant enhancement to Vantage, adding 30 new end database functions that enable customers to use partner tools of their choice to leverage the power of end database analytics, delivering performance at enterprise scale.
This is exactly what is needed by our target market and a recent research study by independent research firm, Vanson Bourne, 87% of IT decision makers felt that they must leverage these emerging technologies to remain competitive.
We believe our cloud business will be approximately $200 million by the end of the year.
We have a path to grow more than 100% year-on-year.
However, given the timing we experienced in Q3, we believe it is prudent to lower our cloud ARR growth outlook from 100% year-over-year to approximately 90% year-over-year.
This confidence is reflected in the new $1 billion repurchase authorization that we announced today and our strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase.
Quarterly highlights include recurring revenue of $352 million or growth of 7% year-over-year as reported.
Gross profit margin of 61.3%, up 30 basis points year-over-year.
Operating margin of 15.4%, up 60 basis points year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43 in line with prior year and $0.11 above the midpoint of our previous outlook.
Some of our year-to-date highlights include total ARR growth of 7% versus the prior year, which is in line with our 2021 full year outlook range of mid- to high single-digit growth.
Year-to-date, recurring revenue growth of 14% versus the prior year compared to our full year outlook range of high single to low double-digit growth.
Earnings per share of $1.86 against our previous full year outlook range of $1.92 to $1.96 and year-to-date free cash flow of $347 million compared to our full year outlook of at least $400 million.
Despite the many highlights, it is unfortunate that a handful of our transactions slipped into Q4, which impacted our cloud ARR in the third quarter by $7 million.
Over the last 18 months, as we have undertaken our transformation journey, Teradata has had a renewed focus on driving greater, rigor, discipline and accountability in the business.
Total ARR increased 7% year-over-year as reported and 6% year-over-year in constant currency.
Total ARR grew by $11 million sequentially.
Subscription ARR increased 18% year-over-year and 2% sequentially.
Public cloud ARR grew 83% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.
Of the $9 million sequential growth, a little more than half resulted from customers migrating to Vantage in the cloud from on-premise perpetual and subscription licenses and most of the remainder from expansion.
We continue to experience healthy expansion rates that are in excess of 130% in the cloud, sustaining the positive trends that we outlined in our recent Investor Day.
Total revenue was $460 million, a 1% increase year-over-year as reported and in constant currency.
We continue to build on a higher base of recurring revenue, which grew 7% year-over-year and 6% in constant currency.
As a percentage of total revenue, recurring revenue was 77% in the third quarter.
In the third quarter, there was an approximate net negative $10 million impact related to upfront recurring revenue.
For reference, this compares to a net positive $22 million impact in the second quarter and $24 million in Q1.
The negative $10 million is due to revenue pulled into the first half of the year from the third quarter, partially offset by upfront recurring revenue recognized in Q3, all related to the renewal or expansion of on-premises deals.
Third quarter gross margin was 61.3%, which was approximately 30 basis points higher than last year's third quarter, primarily due to a higher mix of subscription-based recurring revenue.
Third quarter's operating margin was 15.4%, 60 basis points higher than last year's third quarter, driven by the combination of a lower cost structure from cost discipline, partially offset by sequential investments made in activities supporting the cloud in both go-to-market and R&D.
Total operating expenses were up 5% sequentially and flat year-over-year.
Third quarter earnings per share of $0.43 exceeded our outlook range of $0.30 to $0.34 by $0.11 at the midpoint.
Of the $0.11, $0.05 related to actual expenses being lower than expected, $0.04 related to cost delays and $0.02 related to favorable recurring revenue mix.
We are on track to achieve our fiscal 2021 guidance of at least $400 million in free cash flow.
Through the end of September 2021, year-to-date free cash flow was $347 million.
In the third quarter, free cash flow generated was $23 million due to the seasonality of billings.
In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares or $58 million in total.
For the first nine months of the fiscal year, we spent $179 million on share repurchases for a return of 52% of year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders.
For the full year, we are on track to return at least 15% of free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases while continuing to make investments in the company to support our strategy for profitable growth and cloud acceleration.
We now have a total of approximately $1.3 billion authorized under this open market share repurchase program, in effect immediately until the end of 2025.
Given the strength of our products, along with our robust pipeline in Q4, we do see paths to achieve at least 100% growth in cloud ARR for the full year.
As Steve stated, our updated cloud ARR outlook is approximately 90% growth year-over-year or approximately $200 million.
With regards to earnings per share, we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.15, while still continuing to invest in the business, an increase of $0.19 from the midpoint of the previous range.
For the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29.
We anticipate the tax rate to be approximately 26% in the fourth quarter and approximately 23% for the full year.
We also anticipate the weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately $113 million.
Total ARR growth, which is expected to be in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range; total recurring revenue, which is expected to grow in the high single to low double-digit percentage range year-over-year; total revenue, which is anticipated to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range year-over-year; and free cash flow for the year, which is expected to be at least $400 million.
