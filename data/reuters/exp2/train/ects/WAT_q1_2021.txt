This is now especially relevant from one of the structural changes in the sugar pattern of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $609 million, an increase of approximately 27% in constant currency.
Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in sales growth of 31% as reported.
Our revenue -- our reoccurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue increased by 15% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 45%.
Chemistry revenues were up 18% for the quarter, driven by strong pharma market growth and improving industrial demand.

Combined LC and LCMs instrument sales were up 47%, while TA system sales grew 34%.
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.2%, a 350 basis point increase compared to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and favorable effects.
Operating expenses increased by approximately 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis.
In the first quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14% an increase from last year, as compared to the comparable period included some favorable discrete items in the prior year.
Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million, as anticipated on lower average outstanding debt balances.
Our average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, flat with the first quarter of last year.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 99% to $2.29 in comparison to the $1.15 last year.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.37 compared to $0.86 last year.
In the first quarter of 2021, free cash flow grew 60% year-over-year to $193 million, after funding $40 million of capital expenditures.
Excluded from free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation.
In the first quarter, this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
In the quarter, accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 84 days, down 15 days compared to the first quarter of last year.
Inventory decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior year quarter on higher sales volumes.
In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for $173 million in the first quarter.
These capital allocation activities along with our free cash flow results in cash and short-term investments of $810 million in debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter.
This resulted in a net debt position of $893 million and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1 times at the end of the first quarter.
These dynamics support updated full-year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth up 8% to 11%.
At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage points to 2 percentage points.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be between 57.5% and 58%.
Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of between 28% and 29% based on a combination of investments, the normalization of COVID-related cost, and disciplined expense controls.
Moving now below the operating income line, other key assumptions for the full year guidance are as follows; net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million; a full year tax rate in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%; the net impact of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61.5 million to 62.0 million shares outstanding.
Rolling all this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.85 to $10.05, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings-per-share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
We expect constant currency sales growth to be 14% to 16%.
At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase second quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points.
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 as the significant prior year COVID cost savings actions start to normalize.
At current rates, the positive currency impact on second quarter earnings-per-share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point.
