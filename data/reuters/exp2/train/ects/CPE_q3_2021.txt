Capital spending for the quarter came in at $115 million, below the bottom end of guidance, which was also lowered with the recent guidance update.
We recently completed a strategic consolidation transaction in the Delaware Basin, increasing our footprint to 110,000 net acres in the basin.
Early time productivity has been evident with average peak oil rates of over 1,200 barrels of oil per day across 19 wells in the Wolfcamp A and B, and longer-term performance has also been attractive with 180-day average cumulative oil production of approximately 120,000 barrels of oil, which represents over 72% of the hydrocarbon mix on a two-stream basis.
The combined well package is responding favorably to the modification with all three wells performing ahead of the project type curve through the first 20 days online.
The scale and scope of our Permian position and associated core inventory of over 1,100 locations in the Delaware alone enable us to establish a durable program that builds on substantial project-level returns on capital to support a robust free cash flow profile through mid-cycle commodity pricing.
As part of that execution, multiple noncore monetizations have produced cash proceeds of roughly $210 million in 2021.
We expect that these last few transactions announced since early October, including a smaller monetization of select water disposal assets, to close by year-end, which will put us near the top end of our guidance range of $125 million to $225 million of proceeds for the year.
These proceeds, combined with our 2021 free cash flow generation expectations have established a tangible path to bring leverage under two times by mid-2022 and subsequently drive to our next round of targets of debt-to-EBITDA below one and a half times and absolute leverage of under $2 billion.
