And Matt will take over for a few minutes to cover Slides 3 and 4.
On January 8, the board of directors declared a special dividend of $1 per share payable to our shareholders, payable on February 20, 2020, for shareholders of record on January 21.
The total amount of the special dividend is approximately $20.5 million.
Including this special dividend and the regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share payable on February 4 to shareholders of record on January 2, Park will have paid approximately $536 million or $26.15 per share of cash dividends since the beginning of our fiscal-year '05.
Park's regular cash dividend has been paid -- regular quarterly cash dividend has been paid every year since 1985, never skipped or reduced that regular dividend.
Moving on to Slide 4.
Although our balance sheet shows $144.2 million at the end of our third quarter, some of that cash is really committed for future use.
So the remaining installment payments on that transition tax is $17.7 million that's repaid over the next seven or six years.
And of course, there is this $20.5 million that we just talked about for the special dividend payment.
So the way we look at the cash, although it's $144 million on the balance sheet, it's really roughly $91 million that we say that's -- it's remaining and available for any purposes that we see going forward.
So I'd just add that or comment, I guess, that -- so what is it -- what did Matt tell us $536 million of cash dividends since 2005 fiscal year, $536 million, and we have no debt and $144 million of cash.
That's a lot of money to be paid out, in my opinion, by a small little company like Park that was started by two guys with, I think, about $50,000, $60,000 back in 1954.
So why don't we move on to Slide 5, and Matt was referring to new Kansas expansion.
So the original budget was $20.5 million, and the spending, as Matt indicated -- sorry, Matt talked about how much left to be spent $15.1 million.
So we've spent about $5.4 million so far.
So maybe third time for us, not a charm, three times, meaning that our original building, which was I guess, I think we broke ground that building maybe 2008, then a couple of years later, we did our first expansion to the building kind of the back end of the building, if you look at the picture, so this is our third shot at it.
The expansion is now expected to provide $55 million to $60 million of additional hot-melt composite material manufacturing capacity.
I think the last time we spoke to you, we indicated it might be $15 million, but we pushed that number up, and then we pushed it up by increasing our uptime assumptions realistically, but we feel that we needed to do that.
Why don't we go to Slide 6.
So let's just start on the top Slide 6 -- on Slide 6, we need to separate the different aspects, major aspects or components of our manufacturing operation for you in order to have a more intelligent discussion of manufacturing capacity.
The 60-inch film and tape line.
Last quarter, I think we said it's a -- we had $45 million of capacity with that line.
There's also a 24-inch film and tape lines, $8 million of capacity.
But let's just pick up here on 24-inch film and tape lines.
The assumption here is if you look at the double asterisks is that that tape line, the 24-inch line is being exclusively used for the GE9X Containment Wrap program that we discussed in our past.
So remember, for -- with MRAS, we had a long-term agreement through 2029.
So we're saying, for purposes of this analysis, let's say, we only use a 24-inch line for the case containment wrap production, $8 million, but we want to make sure we're moving all the case wrap production from the 60-inch line, so the 60-inch line will have more capacity.
So solution treated composite materials, $55 million.
I think we just did the math, I got my pocket calculator out, $108 million.
Now there's an issue related to $45 million of hot-melt materials manufacturing capacity from the 60-inch film and tape lines.
Hot-melt material production was approximately $9.5 million in fiscal year -- sorry, in the third quarter, just third quarter.
Let's do the math, 9.5 times four.
Is that $38 million?
That's less than $45 million, right?
But let's look at the next item, but the hot-melt materials manufacturing operations produced at an annualized run rate of $45 million during the month of October and November.
Let's go on to Slide 7, more about capacity.
As a result of short-term variability we've been talking about peaks and valleys of the GE Programs business, it may be difficult to handle the peaks with $45 million of hot-melt materials manufacturing capacity.
We have got $45 million of capacity for the next two years.
Our solution, we're increasing our hot-melt, our 60-inch hot-melt manufacturing -- 60-inch film and tape line, I should say, hot-melt manufacturing capacity from $45 million to $55 million.
Two things we need to do, as we mentioned before, we need to move all of the GE9X production to the 24-inch film and tape line.
And then we're also increasing the 60-inch film and tape lines uptime by 10%, again, increasing the uptime.
Product is actually running through it over the course of 24 hours.
So you have 12 hours uptime, that's 50%.
So 18 hours would be what, 75%.
And again, I think the -- our ability to achieve $55 million number is quite realistic.
Let's go on to Slide 8.
So the prior quarters are provided for your perspective, let's look at Q3, the sales were $15.847 million; gross profit, a little over $5 million; gross margin, $31.7 million.
So EBITDA, $3.622 million.
We said our sales estimate was -- I'm rushing because we have a lot to cover so maybe too fast, $14.75 million to $15.75 million.
And our forecast estimate on EBITDA, what we said was $3 million to $3.5 million.
With sales, it was in the case you want to do the math, $97,000 above the top of the range.
EBITDA $120,000 above the top of the range, just a little bit.
And now we have to discuss Q3, so let's go on to Slide 9.
Now the need to run hot-melt production in October and November at an annualized run rate of $45 million.
This resulted -- sorry, and the need to run hot-melt production in October and November at an annualized run rate of $45 million.
The current manufacturing capacity limit of Park 60-inch hot-melt film and tape lines.
And just FYI, in case you're interested, everybody at Park received a $250 bonus for Q3, and we felt it was well deserved.
Let's go to Slide 10.
So we hired 10 additional production and lab people during Q3.
That hot-melt tape line operation, a 24-inch hot-melt tape line operation now running 24/7, which obviously it needs to, right?
We started from scratch with nothing probably, I guess, we probably broke ground in 2008, and we're kind of learning as we go.
That goes back to 1954.
They hire 1,000 people all the time, they lay off 1,000 people all the time.
And our people count is 135.
So that's how many people received that $250 bonus, 135.
The cost of offering the 24-inch hot-melt line, while there's a cost of doing that as well.
Let's go to Slide 11.
$15 million to $16 million of revenue; EBITDA, $3.1 million to $3.6 million.
The amount shipped so far in the quarter plus the amount booked to be shipped in the quarter was about -- approximately $13 million.
So there's a little bit of a hole to fill to get to that $15 million to $16 million top line.
They're still in place, outside testing costs, GE9X Program, film adhesive trials, a 24-inch line.
And I want to remind you, by the way, that Q4 of last year was a 14-week quarter.
This year's Q4 is a 13-week quarter like our normal quarter.
So every four years, we have a one 14-week quarter to kind of catch-up with the calendar.
Let's go on to Slide 12.
All the major jet engine company programs and GE Programs, except the 747-8, my favorite airplane, are ramping or in development.
Boeing 747 is flat.
The first shipment, I think, was in -- was at February 28, 2014, that was for the 747.
Bombardier Global 7500 with the Passport 20 engines.
Let's go to Slide 14.
Here's a nice one, DC-10/KC-10 aircraft.
The KC-10 is, I think, the tanker version of the DC-10.
This doesn't relate -- this one doesn't relate to the problems with the 737.
The other thing is there's been reports recently that because of the 737 MAX issues that Airbus is actually attempting to increase production of the A320 family of aircraft.
The other major single-isle contender is the Boeing 737, the 737 MAX aircraft, and we don't have any content we're aware of on that third platform.
It's also another just luck in terms of being on the A320 and the COMAC919 as compared to the 737 MAX.
We of course didn't -- we didn't foresee the problems with the 737 MAX, just pure luck in both cases.
So this is 22 for us.
