I'm now turning to Slide 3.
We leverage the strength of our business model by raising over $13 billion for our commercial clients of which we retained approximately 19% on our balance sheet.
We also identified 70 branches for consolidation representing approximately 7% of our network.
We reported net income of $591 million or $0.61 per share for the first quarter.
On a per share basis, this is an increase of 9% from the fourth-quarter results and up significantly from the year-ago period.
We reached a new milestone in our consumer mortgage business with record loan originations of $3 billion for the quarter.
In addition to adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, consumer mortgage fees were up 135% from the year-ago period.
We reported a record $8.3 billion of originations in 2020, and we expect to eclipse that level this year.
Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%, which is above our targeted range of nine to nine and a half percent.
This quarter, we repurchased $135 million of common shares.
Our board of directors also approved our first-quarter common stock dividend of 18 and half cents a share.
Now turning to Slide 4.
Since our acquisition, Laurel Road has generated over $4.6 billion in high-quality loan originations adding high-value digital relationships with healthcare professionals.
I'm now on Slide 6.
As Chris said, it was a strong start to the year with net income from continuing operations of $0.61 per common share, up 9% from the prior quarter and over four times from the year-ago period.
Turning to Slide 7.
Total average loans were $101 billion, up 5% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans.
PPP loans had an impact of $7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 average balances.
Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road and as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business with $3 billion of consumer mortgage loans this quarter.
Linked quarter average loan balances were down 1%, reflecting lower commercial utilization rates and a reduction in average PPP balances.
We had just under $1 billion of PPP forgiveness in the current quarter.
Consumer loans were up 1% from the prior quarter, again related to continued production from consumer mortgage and Laurel Road.
Continuing on to Slide 8.
Average deposits totaled $138 billion for the first quarter of 2021, up $28 billion or 25% compared to the year-ago period and up 1.5% from the prior quarter.
The interest-bearing deposit costs came down another 3 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020, following an 8-basis-point decline last quarter.
We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix.
Turning to Slide 9.
Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.012 billion for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $989 million a year ago and $1.043 billion for the prior quarter.
Our net interest margin was 2.61% for the first quarter of 2021 compared to 3.01% for the same period last year and 2.7% from the prior quarter.
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income decreased $31 million and the margin declined 9 basis points.
The decrease in net interest income was caused by the day count of approximately $14 million, lower loan fees of $8 million and lower loan balances resulting in an additional $8 million reduction to NII.
Net interest margin also reflected a 4-basis-point reduction due to the increases in our liquidity position.
Moving on to Slide 10.
Non-interest income was $738 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $477 million for the year-ago period and $802 million in the fourth quarter.
Compared to the year-ago period, non-interest income increased 55%.
We had a record first quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $162 million driven by broad-based strength across the platform.
Record mortgage originations drove mortgage -- consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $27 million or 135% from the first quarter of '20.
Cards and payments income also increased $39 million related to higher prepaid card activity from state government support programs as well as the growth in the core platform.
Other income in the year-ago period included $92 million of market-related valuation adjustments.
Compared to the fourth quarter, non-interest income decreased by $64 million.
I'm now on Slide 11.
Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $1.071 billion compared to $931 million last year and $1.1 billion in the prior quarter.
The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation, which increased $58 million and the increase in our stock price resulting in a $36 million increase compared to last year.
Employee benefit costs also increased $15 million.
Year over year, payments-related costs reported in other expense were $32 million higher, driven by higher prepaid activity.
Compared to the prior quarter, non-interest expense decreased $57 million.
Moving now to Slide 12.
For the first quarter, net charge-offs were $114 million or 46 basis points of average loans.
Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $93 million.
Non-performing loans were $728 million this quarter or 72 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of almost $60 million from the prior quarter.
Additionally, criticized loans declined and the 30- to 90-day delinquencies also improved again quarter over quarter with a 5-basis-point decrease, while the 90-day plus category remain relatively flat.
Now on to Slide 13.
We ended the first quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, which places us above our targeted range of nine to nine and a half perccent.
Our board of directors approved a first-quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share.
We also repurchased $135 million of common shares under the share repurchase authorization we announced in January of up to $900 million.
This leaves us with a capacity of up to $765 million for the next two quarters.
On Slide 14, we provide our full-year 2021 outlook, which we've adjusted to reflect our strong start to the year, positive momentum in our business and more favorable revenue outlook.
We have reduced our net charge-off guidance, which is now expected to be in the 35 to 45-basis-point range for the year.
And our guidance for our GAAP tax rate remains unchanged at around 19% for the year.
