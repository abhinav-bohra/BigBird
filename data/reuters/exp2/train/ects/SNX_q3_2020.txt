The Concentrix F-10 document is available for your review.
The third quarter revenue for Concentrix totaled $1.16 billion, slightly higher than the same quarter last year.
This is just the latest innovation from our staff of well over 1,000 skilled engineers and developers.
The communication vertical is now approximately 21% of revenue, representing an impact of 4% to our year-over-year growth rate, but giving us a much more balanced portfolio.
As expected, our travel, transportation and tourism clients during the quarter have been impacted by COVID-19, resulting in an additional 2% impact on growth.
Now moving to profitability; adjusted operating income for the quarter was $118 million or 10.1%, nearly reaching the year-ago level.
The return to double-digit operating margin reflects revenue over performance, with lower variable spend, despite $13 million of additional net COVID-19 cost impacts.
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled approximately $91 million.
Capital expenditures totaled approximately $37 million.
As a result, we expect fourth quarter revenue to increase by at least 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and we expect our adjusted operating margin to be above 12.5%.
We intend to announce our Board of Directors in an updated Form 10 Registration Statement in early October.
