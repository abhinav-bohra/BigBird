We have added more than 55,000 net acres of oil-weighted high-margin inventory underwritten at oil prices well below today's strip.
Our operations teams were able to maintain Laredo's long term positive trajectory of drilling and completions efficiency gains, allowing us to further reduce our total drilling, completions and equipment costs to $525 per foot throughout 2021.
This insulated us from rising sand prices and eliminated about 300,000 miles per month of trucking, further reducing cost and the emissions associated with trucking.
At the time, we expected savings of approximately $90,000 per well.
Due to the inflationary pressures in sand, our savings now total over $250,000 per well relative to current market prices.
But we are anticipating inflation of around 15% in 2022 versus our midyear expectations when we communicated our initial thoughts for 2022 capital expenditures.
We expect full company LOE to be around $4.25 per BOE for full year 2022.
Our first two-well packages in Central Howard were developed on a spacing of 16 wells per DSU.
In the subsequent two well packages, we began to transition our spacing to wider space developments, including 14 and then ultimately, 12 wells per DSU.
The third and fourth well packages, which were developed at wider spacing, are currently performing 24% and 36% better than the first two well packages, driving superior economics and value per section.
During the third quarter, we flared or vented 1.89% of produced gas.
Excluding the North Howard assets, we further vented 0.55% of produced gas during the quarter.
We have set aggressive goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas and methane emissions along with the elimination of routine flaring by 2025.
Then in mid-July, we issued $400 million of notes due in 2029, terming out our credit facility.
As part of that process, we also renewed and extended the maturity of our credit facility to 2025 and restructured our bank group, dropping eight banks that wanted to reduce their energy exposure and adding four banks strongly committed to the sector.
Lastly, we announced our second significant acquisition of 2021 with the agreement to purchase approximately 20,000 net acres in Western Glasscock County, extending our oil-weighted development runway to seven years.
Our cash margin even with the dramatic increase in natural gas and NGL realizations would have been more than 20% lower than our reported numbers.
As I mentioned previously, we issued $400 million of notes due in 2029 with a coupon 2.25% lower than our previous benchmark note.
In October, our borrowing base of our credit facility was increased from $725 million to $1 billion.
Our current liquidity based on the $725 million of elected commitments is approximately $600 million.
And at current commodity prices, including our hedges, our free cash flow generation in 2022 is approximately $300 million.
