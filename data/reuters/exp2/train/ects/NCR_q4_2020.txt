I'll begin on Slide 4 with some highlights from the fourth quarter and full year.
We generated $149 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $448 million of free cash flow for the year.
Second, we expanded adjusted EBITDA margin sequentially for the third consecutive quarter to 15.8% in the fourth quarter, which represents an increase of 10 basis points from the third quarter.
We entered 2021 with $150 million in cost savings that are expected to drive margin expansion.
Third, we delivered 6% recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter, bringing recurring revenue to 54% of total revenue.
Throughout 2020, we have made steady progress generating increased recurring revenue, which is consistent with our 80, 60, 20 goals.
We continue to expect the proposed transaction to close midyear 2021 and to be 20 to 25% accretive to earnings per share in its first full year.
Now, moving to Slide 5.
We remain focused on our transition to drive NCR as-a-Service and achieve our 80, 60, 20 strategic goals.
For the full-year 2020, software and services represented 72% of our total revenues, up from 65% in 2019, and 54% of our revenues were recurring, up from 46% in 2019.
EBITDA margin was 14.4%.
One of those new customers was Wintrust, a $43 billion bank with 15 branded community bank subsidiaries that selected NCR's D3 Digital Banking solution.
We have already started off 2021 strong with the signing of another new D3 customer-associated bank, which is a $35 billion regional bank based in Wisconsin.
We continue to be excited about the sales funnel for NCR Emerald and recently signed our biggest NCR Emerald deal to date with the largest cooperative in Canada with 1,500 stores.
During the fourth quarter, over 90% of all Aloha sites sold to our direct offices were sold as subscription bundles, with payments attach rate also strong at roughly 75% of sales into new sites.
Turning to Slide 6, which presents the top-level overview of our fourth-quarter financial performance.
Starting on the top left, consolidated revenue was $1.63 billion, down $255 million or 14% versus the 2019 fourth quarter.
Revenue was up $42 million, or 3% sequentially from 2020's third quarter, with all three business segments showing increases.
And while I'll dig into the more specific drivers of the year-over-year decline later, in aggregate, $203 million, or 80% of that decline was attributable to lower hardware revenue, which was down 30%.
Recurring revenue was up 6% year over year and 3% sequentially.
We shifted $32 million or over two points of revenue that previously would have been booked upfront as a perpetual sale to a recurring revenue stream.
This compares to just $9 million in last year's fourth quarter or $27 million in this year's Q3.
In the top right, adjusted EBITDA decreased $41 million or 14% year over year to $258 million, in line with the revenue decline, with EBITDA margin rate down only slightly from the prior year, ending at 15.8%.
On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA was up 4%, and EBITDA margin rate expanded 10 basis points.
These actions were upsized from $100 million to $150 million to allow us to sustain our profitability at pandemic levels of demand and to drive further margin expansion as demand improves and our revenues follow.
$27 million of adjusted EBITDA did shift out of the quarter, accompanying the respective revenue shift.
This compares to $8 million in the year ago Q4 and $21 million sequentially from Q3.
And in the bottom left, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.59, down $0.26 from the prior-year fourth quarter and up $0.04 from Q3.
The tax rate of 20% for Q4 decreased as a result of the lower than planned income, which causes planned discrete tax items to have an outside effect on the overall rate.
And finally and maybe most importantly, we generated $149 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $448 million for the full year.
This compares to $302 million in the year ago quarter by just $281 million for that full year.
While in 2020, we generated a much more linear free cash flow result, with approximately $150 million in each of the last three successive quarters.
Moving to Slide 7, which describes our banking segment results.
Banking revenue decreased $149 million or 16% mainly driven by a 36% decline in ATM hardware.
Operating income decreased $57 million or 40%, and operating margin rate declined by 440 basis points to 10.9%.
About 60% of that decline was hardware-related and included lower volumes, a disadvantageous geography mix, resulting unabsorbed costs and a lower attached software sales.
The remainder was from the shift to -- of $17 million of software to future period recurring revenue.
Operating expenses were only down 3% and will need to go lower in '21.
On a sequential basis, revenue was up 2%, and operating margin decreased by 180 basis points.
For digital banking revenue, 2020 marked an inflection point as the full year increased 4% over 2019.
Digital banking registered users increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and showed nice sequential growth over the last five quarters.
Recurring revenue in this business increased 8% year over year and 3% sequentially.
Moving to Slide 8, which shows our retail segment results.
Retail revenue decreased $40 million or 7% against a very tough hardware comparison.
That said, operating income was up $7 million or 17% versus Q4 2019.
Sequentially, revenue was up 2%, and operating margin expanded 50 basis points.
And platform lanes increased 40% compared to prior-year fourth quarter.
Recurring revenue in this business increased 11% versus the fourth quarter in 2019 and increased 3% sequentially.
Slide 9 shows our hospitality segment results.
Hospitality revenue decreased $50 million or 22% driven primarily by lower hardware sales.
Fourth-quarter operating income declined $8 million mainly due to the flow-through impact from lower revenue.
As was the case in Q3, we were able to partially preserve profitability by reducing operating expenses by 15%.
Aloha Essentials sites, which bundled software, services, hardware and payments into a single offering, grew 42% when compared to prior-year fourth quarter and grew 9% from this year's third quarter.
While down 5% last year, it was up 6% in the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 10.
Software revenue decreased 9% due primarily to the shift from onetime recurring revenue, which represented approximately two-thirds of the decline.
And finally, as I mentioned previously, hardware revenue was the most impacted in the quarter by the pandemic, declining 30%.
ATM revenue declined 36%, while the combination of self-checkout and point of sales declined 23%.
Software and services as a percentage of total company revenue increased to 71% from 64% in the prior quarter, with lower hardware sales exaggerating our improvement.
Recurring revenues increased 6%, driven by our programmatic effort to shift our sales away from single sales events with perpetual licensing to predictable multiyear commitments with relatively high certainty of revenue generation.
Recurring revenue as a percentage of total company revenue increased to 54% from 44% in Q4 of 2019, also benefiting from lower hardware sales.
On Slide 11, you'll see the same revenue snapshot but for the full-year 2020 versus full-year 2019.
The shift in recurring revenue had a $100 million impact to the full year or roughly 80% of the software decline.
Service revenue continued to show resiliency with 2% year-over-year growth.
Recurring revenue increased 5% year over year, living up to its title and validating our emphasis on it.
We ended the year with 54% of our revenue as recurring.
On Slide 12, we present free cash flow, net debt and adjusted EBITDA metrics.
Free cash flow was $149 million in the quarter.
Although a decline from the prior-year period, we ended the year with free cash flow of $448 million, up nearly 60% from the $281 million in the prior year.
Also, during the fourth quarter, we made a $70 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. pension plan, which is expected to push our mandatory contributions out until 2023.
This slide also shows our net debt to adjusted EBITDA metric with a net debt leverage ratio of 3.3 times.
We ended the year with $338 million of cash, having paid down both our outstanding revolver and our trade receivable securitization facility and having retired 132,000 shares of preferred stock.
We remain well within our debt covenants and ended the fourth quarter with a credit facility leverage of approximately 3.3 times, well under our debt covenant maximum of 4.6.
Turning to Slide 13.
Those cost actions and the related operational changes or product decisions resulted in approximately $200 million of restructuring charges in our fourth quarter.
Approximately $150 million of those were non-cash charges, mainly related to excess inventory and software impairment charges related to strategic changes.
The remaining $50 million were cash charges for severance and the resolution of several legacy items.
We entered 2021 with an estimated $150 million of run rate cost savings.
Approximately 40% of those savings are from operating costs, another 40% from SG&A and the remaining 20% from the corporate functions.
And my last slide is Slide 14, which provides an outlook for Q1 2021.
But for Q1, relative to the year ago Q1, so on a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue growth of 2 to 3%.
On profitability, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by 250 basis points to 15%.
But remember that we have had about $150 million of unavoidable payments in the first quarter related to benefits and compensation that occur in every Q1.
First, we will continue to accelerate our NCR as-a-Service and 80, 60, 20 strategy.
Turning to Slide 16.
It will enhance our scale and cash flow generation while advancing our 80, 60, 20 targets by roughly two years.
Additionally, the proposed transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings per share by 20 to 25% in the first full year.
