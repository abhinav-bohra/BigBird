These attributes include the proportion, representing approximately 70% of our revenue that comes from essential and recurring services, including our tax services, insurance services, payroll services and a host of others that our clients rely on us to provide regardless of business conditions.
To put this in context, the total revenue from this segment of our payroll clients represents less than 4% of CBIZ' total revenues.
With total revenue growing by 8.4% in the first quarter, revenue growth from acquired businesses accounted for 4.8% of that growth, with same unit growth up by 3.6%.
Our Financial Services group recorded total revenue growth of 8.1%, with same unit revenue growth of 4.5%.
Turning to the benefits and insurance group, total revenue grew by 9.6%, with same unit revenue growth of 1.6% in the first quarter this year.
But after reporting a same unit revenue decline of 3% for the full year last year, the 1.6% first quarter same unit revenue growth within benefits insurance this year is noteworthy.
Also, as a reminder, in the first quarter a year ago, we recorded an additional $2 million of bad debt expense.
We are pleased to report 390 basis point margin expansion on pre-tax income, leading to a 39.4% increase in earnings per share, up to $0.92 per share this year compared with $0.66 in the first quarter a year ago.
This impacts our reported gross margin, which was 27.1% on an adjusted basis this year compared to 22.6% a year ago.
And operating margin on an adjusted basis was 22.4% compared with 18.2% a year ago.
Cash flow has continued to be strong, with days sales outstanding on receivables improving from 94 days a year ago to 91 days this year.
At March 31 this year, the balance outstanding on our $400 million unsecured credit facility was $162 million compared with $108 million outstanding at December 31, 2020.
This leaves approximately $230 million of unused capacity at March 31.
In the first quarter, we used approximately $32.7 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares.
Since the end of the quarter through April 27, we have purchased approximately 270,000 additional shares under a 10b program for a total of approximately 1.4 million shares repurchased this year to date.
As a result of this repurchase activity, we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count for 2021 within a range of 54 million to 54.5 million shares, which represents a slight reduction in our full year expectation compared with guidance earlier this year, and we will provide further updates as we progress through the year.
With over $200 million of unused capacity, we have the flexibility to be aggressive in pursuing potential acquisitions.
Collectively, these acquisitions are expected to contribute approximately $48 million of annualized revenue, and we will see these transactions contribute to revenue growth throughout this year.
In the first quarter, we used $3.7 million for acquisitions, including earn-out payments on acquisitions closed in previous years.
Future earn-out payments are estimated at approximately $11.8 million for the balance of this year, $16.1 million next year in 2022, approximately $9.7 million in 2023, approximately $13.5 million in 2024, and $800,000 in 2025.
Capital spending in the first quarter was $1.1 million.
Last year, capital spending for the full year was $11.7 million.
And for 2021, we continue to estimate capital spending at approximately $12 million to $15 million for the full year.
Adjusted EBITDA grew by 28.5% to $73.3 million reported in the first quarter this year, up from $57 million a year ago.
The margin expansion on adjusted EBITDA was 370 basis points to 24.3% of revenue this year compared with 20.6% a year ago.
The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 24.1%, and we continue to project an effective tax rate for the full year of approximately 25%.
Founded in 1985 by Bob Bernston and Greg Porter, over time Bernston Porter grew to be one of the top 10 CPA firms in the Puget Sound region.
Our revised guidance is to grow revenue between 8% to 10% and earnings per share within a range of 12% to 15% for the full year of 2021 compared to the full year of 2020.
