Now regarding the investment portfolio, invested assets are $17.3 billion, including $16.4 billion of fixed maturities and amortized cost.
Now the fixed maturities $15.7 billion are investment-grade with an average rating of A-, and below investment-grade bonds were $674 million, compared to $666 million a year ago.
The percentage of below investment-grade bonds to fixed maturities is 4.1%, compared to 4.2% a year ago.
Bonds rated BBB are 55% of the fixed maturity portfolio, down from 58% at the end of 2018.
Finally, we had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $2.5 billion, $97 million lower than the previous quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we invested $449 million in investment-grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal, industrial and financial sectors.
We invested at an average yield of 4.11%, an average rating of A+ and an average life of 31 years.
For the entire portfolio, the fourth-quarter yield was 5.41%, down 15 basis points from the yield of fourth-quarter 2018.
As of December 31, the portfolio yield was approximately 5.41%.
For 2020, at the midpoint of our guidance, we assumed an average new money yield of 4.10% for the full year.
Fortunately, the impact of lower new money rates on our investment income is somewhat limited as we expect to have an average turnover of less than 2% per year in our investment portfolio over the next five years.
The parent began the year with liquid assets of $41 million.
In addition to these liquid assets, the parent generated excess cash flow in 2019 of $374 million, as compared to $349 million in 2018.
Thus, including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year, we had $415 million available to the parent during the year.
As discussed on our prior calls, we accelerated the repurchase of $25 million of Globe Life shares into December of 2018, with commercial paper and parent cash.
We utilized $20 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases, that left $395 million available for other uses, including the $50 million of liquid assets we normally retain as a parent.
In the fourth quarter, we spent $93 million to buy 930,000 Globe Life shares at an average price of $99.82.
For the full-year 2019, we spent $350 million of parent company cash to acquire 3.9 million shares at an average price of $89.04.
So far in 2020, we have spent $33.5 million to buy 322,000 shares at an average price of $104.20.
The parent ended the year with liquid assets of approximately $45 million.
While our 2019 statutory earnings have not yet been finalized, we expect excess cash flow in 2020 to be in the range of $375 million to $395 million.
Thus, including the assets on hand at January 1, we currently expect to have around $420 million to $440 million of cash and liquid assets available to the parent in 2020.
As noted on previous calls, Globe Life has targeted a consolidated company-action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320% for 2019.
For 2020, we will continue to target a consolidated company-action-level RBC ratio in the range of 300% to 320%.
As Gary previously noted, net operating income per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.70.
In addition, net operating income per share for the full-year 2019 was $6.75.
This was $0.01 above the midpoint of our previous guidance.
For 2020, we are projecting that net operating income per share will be in the range of $7.03 to $7.23.
The $7.13 midpoint of this guidance is slightly lower than previous guidance due to higher-than-expected employee pension and healthcare costs in 2020.
