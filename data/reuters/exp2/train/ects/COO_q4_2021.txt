Regarding fourth quarter results and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, consolidated revenues were $759 million, with CooperVision at $565 million, up 11%; and CooperSurgical at $194 million, up 11%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.28.
For CooperVision, our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio led the way, growing 19%.
For the regions, the Americas grew 6%, led by our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, with particular strength in MyDay, where we continue seeing strong fit activity.
EMEA grew a healthy 15%, with improving consumer activity and strength in our key accounts driving growth and share gains.
Asia Pac grew 14%, led by a steady improvement in consumer activity and success with several new product launches.
Our portfolio grew 63% to $21 million, with MiSight up 165% to $7 million and Ortho K products up 40%.
We reached our goal of $65 million for the year, up 76% year over year, and our momentum is strong.
Regarding MiSight, we didn't quite reach our target this quarter, but we did reach $19 million in sales for the full year, up a very impressive 149% year over year.
We've also assembled an advisory board of key opinion leaders, whose affiliated hospitals represent over 50% of myopia management contact lens volume in China.
As a reminder, childhood myopia rates in China are estimated at over 80%, and reducing myopia is a priority for the Chinese government, so the opportunity is significant.
It cuts myopia progression by roughly 59% on average.
Overall, on myopia management, our momentum is strong, and we're still targeting constant currency growth of over 50% in fiscal 2022, to roughly $100 million in sales.
To conclude on Vision, we estimate the overall contact lens market grew 7% in calendar Q3, while CooperVision grew 8% even as new fits remain below pre-COVID levels.
data, roughly 64% of eye care practitioners stated they had capacity to serve more patients but cannot, mostly due to staffing challenges.
Having said that, trends are positive, and we expect the market to grow in the 4% to 6% range this coming year, supported by improving fit activity in the U.S. and EMEA and reopening activity in Asia Pac.
Meanwhile, the long-term macro growth trends remain solid, with roughly one-third of the world being myopic today and that expected to increase to 50% by 2050.
Our fertility business performed exceptionally well, growing 24% year over year to $82 million.
Regarding the broader fertility industry, our addressable market is approaching $2 billion, with 5% to 10% long-term growth expected.
It's estimated that one in eight couples has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors, such as increasing maternal age, and that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility.
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 3%.
Medical devices performed well, growing 20%, led by our portfolio of uterine manipulators, several of our surgical devices and our next-generation EndoSee Advance product line.
Meanwhile, PARAGARD declined 17%, largely as forecasted due to buy-in activity from last quarter's price increase.
Lastly, for CooperSurgical, we recently announced an agreement to acquire Generate Life Sciences for $1.6 billion.
Roughly one-third of the business is in fertility, which we estimate will grow 5% to 10% long-term, supported by general industry growth.
Two-thirds of the business is in cord blood and cord tissue storage, which we expect to grow 3% to 5% long term.
Consolidated, this business offers long-term sustainable growth of 4% to 6%, and we believe there are opportunities to push that range higher with potential revenue synergies as we leverage our expertise.
Fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 11% year over year and also 11% in constant currency to $759 million.
Consolidated gross margin decreased year over year by 20 basis points to 67.5% driven primarily by currency, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs at CooperVision.
Operating expenses grew 16% as strategic investments in sales and marketing to support myopia management and fertility continued.
Consolidated operating margins were 24.9%, down from 26.8% last year.
Interest expense was $5 million on lower average debt, and the effective tax rate was 10.3%, helped by stock option exercises in the quarter.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.28, with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding.
FX negatively impacted us and was roughly $0.05 worse than expected when we gave guidance last quarter.
Free cash flow was solid at $110 million, comprised of $175 million of operating cash flow, offset by $65 million of capex.
Net debt decreased to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted leverage ratio improved to 1.38 times.
Moving to 2022 guidance and excluding the recently announced Generate Life Sciences acquisition, consolidated revenues are expected to be in the range of $3.032 billion to $3.090 billion, up 6% to 8% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $2.225 billion and $2.267 billion, up 6% to 8% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues between $807 million and $823 million, up 6% to 8% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $13.60 to $14, up 9.5% to 12.5% in constant currency.
And the tax rate is expected to be around 13%.
At the midpoint of guidance, this equates to constant currency revenue growth of roughly 7% and constant currency earnings per share growth of roughly 11%.
Regarding currency on a year-over-year basis, we're expecting an FX headwind of roughly 2.5% on revenues and 7% on earnings per share.
This impact will be most detrimental in Q1, where we're expecting earnings per share in the $3 to $3.10 range.
As of today, we're optimistic we'll close in the next couple of weeks, which would give us roughly 10.5 months of their operations in our fiscal 2022.
As previously announced, Generate has roughly $250 million in trailing 12-month revenue.
Gross margins are expected to be roughly 70%.
As we are now closer to securing permanent financing for this transaction, we are updating our year one non-GAAP earnings per share accretion estimate to around $0.50 and would add that we expect this accretion to improve in year two with synergies.
