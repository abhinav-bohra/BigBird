Before we speak about third-quarter results, I want to share with you about the progress made in each element of our AEL 2.0 strategy that was first unveiled around this time, last year.
Infrastructure debt and infrastructure equity, middle-market loans to private companies, and lending to recurring revenue, technology or software with an acronym called STARR, with two Rs, sector companies, all of which would allow AEL to deploy an additional couple of billion dollars each year in private assets, demonstrably moving us toward a goal of 30% to 40% in private assets.
For us the weighted average fee of the first $5 billion seeded [Phonetic] to Brookfield, including $4 billion of in-force that was seeded effective July 1 was 97 basis points better than the 90 basis points originally described last October.
The forward flow reinsurance fees at 170 basis points for six years to seven years is a meaningfully positive signal on the quality of our liability origination and the strength of our franchise.
In summary, late last year, we outlined the building blocks for AEL 2.0, and in 2021, we have executed all proof points for the fundamental building blocks.
We have $236 million in share repurchase authorization remaining and we expect to target the return of $250 million [Phonetic] of capital to common shareholders for 2021 starting immediately with our next regularly scheduled dividend after Board approval, later this quarter, and then, share repurchases after approval of Brookfield for May to increase its ownership in AEL from 9.9% to as high as 19.9%.
With the closing of the refinancing, we will realize the capital savings, including but not only limited to, the capital savings we intended to achieve with a potential reinsurance of $5 billion of in-force only block of business to Varde Agam [Phonetic].
Additionally, the new redundant reserve financing will save approximately $9 million pre-tax per quarter in financing costs once the transaction is closed relative to the prior facility.
Third-quarter operating costs already reflected $2 million of savings from the recapture of finance reserves that were then seeded to Brookfield.
Therefore, we expect the refinancing of the remaining redundant reserves currently being financed to result in an additional $7 million of quarterly savings going forward.
With the number of recent announcements, we finished the last 12 months with a revitalized and reorganized investment department and the asset management relationships we need to respond with resilience to changing markets.
Our promise to you was to develop the relationships necessary to transform our investment portfolio toward a 30% to 40% allocation to privately sourced assets.
Even with $45 billion in core public assets, American Equity can't match both the breadth and depth of expertise of the large public fixed income asset managers.
BlackRock took over management of $45 billion of assets in October and has already invested over $1.8 billion of company cash into long-term securities on our behalf.
As part of this agreement, we have committed to initially invest $1 billion from our general account in such loans.
In addition, we purchased over $1 billion of mortgage loans related to this transaction that are a particularly good asset-liability match for further duration liabilities that we may issue.
To date, we've done $327 million dollars with Adam Street in middle-market loans.
Since beginning our partnership with Pretium, we've invested $779 million in residential mortgages, and since this summer, $301 million in single-family rental homes.
Including residential mortgage loans, single-family rental homes, commercial mortgage and agricultural loans, and middle-market loans, to date, we've invested approximately $2.5 billion dollars in privately sourced assets during 2021, exceeding our promise of investing $1 billion to $2 billion in privately sourced assets this year.
Privately sourced assets currently account for approximately 15% of invested assets.
The net unrealized gain position at quarter-end was $4.5 billion, down $327 million from the three months earlier as interest rates moved higher.
From a liquidity standpoint, we continue to hold cash in excess of our current target level of 2% of invested assets.
At September 30, we had $7.6 billion of cash and equivalents and the investment company portfolios, compared to $10 billion at June 30.
Currently, we have approximately $3 billion of uncommitted cash to deploy between now and early 2022 to be fully invested.
For the quarter, new investment asset purchases totaled approximately $400 million, almost entirely in privately sourced assets.
The expected return on new money investments in the quarter was approximately 4.6%, net of fees.
The current point in time yield on the portfolio, was roughly in [Phonetic] investment activities through October 31, was approximately 3.7%.
After the redeployment of remaining cash that is an excess of our target, we continue to estimate the yield on our investment portfolio will be approximately 4%.
Moving on to sales results for the third quarter, total sales of $1.3 billion were up 11% versus the second quarter of this year.
For the third quarter, FIA or fixed index annuity sales increased 3%, sequentially, to $915 million.
Year-to-date, total sales of $4.9 billion positions us to end the year firmly toward the upper end of our 2021 sales goal of $5 billion to $6 billion outlined at the start of the year.
At American Equity Life, total sales through the IMO channel was $760 million.
Of this, fixed index annuity sales increased 4% to $728 million from $703 million sequentially, as the refreshed AssetShield series continues with its momentum and got a nice lift from the introduction of the state sheet [Phonetic].
FIA sales at Eagle Life of $188 million represents a 2% increase versus the second quarter of 2021 and 210% increase compared to the year-ago quarter.
Within FIA sales at Eagle Life, the early signs of a mix shift toward income product sales albeit off a small base is visible as income product sales were up 80% [Phonetic] over the second quarter of this year.
Multiyear fixed-rate annuity sales were up 37% over the second quarter as we entered one of the largest banks in the country as part of our distribution footprint expansion and expect to shift mix to fixed index annuities in this bank in 2022.
Excluding one notable item, we reported non-GAAP operating income of $136 million or $1.46 per share.
For the third quarter of 2021, we reported non-GAAP operating income of $79.5 million or $0.85 per diluted common share compared to a loss of $249.8 million or $2.72 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2020.
Excluding actuarial assumption updates, which was the first notable item this year and the single notable item for this quarter, operating income for the third quarter of 2021 was $136.3 million or $1.46 per diluted common share, compared with $91.1 million or $0.98 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.
The third quarter 2021 non-GAAP operating results were negatively affected by $56.8 million or $0.61 per diluted common share from updates to actuarial assumptions.
Third-quarter 2020 non-GAAP operating results were negatively affected by $340.9 million or $3.70 [Phonetic] per diluted common share from such updates.
On a pre-tax basis, the effect of the third quarter 2021 updates before the change to earnings pattern resulting from these updates decreased amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements by $161 million and increased the liability for future payments under Lifetime Income Benefit Riders by $233 million for a total decrease in pre-tax operating income of $72 million.
We have updated or assumptions for aggregate spread at American Equity Life to increase from 2.25% in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 2.4% by year-end 2022, and then move modestly higher to 2.5% at the end of the eight-year reversion period, with a near term discount rate through 2023 of 155 basis points, and eventually grading to 210 basis points by the end of the eight-year reversion period.
Last year, we had several assumptions for aggregate spread to increase from 2.4% in the near term to 2.6% at the end of the eight-year reversion period, with a discount rate of 1.6%, grading fairly linearly to an ultimate discount rate of 2.1%.
The effect of this change was to increase back in DSI amortization by $67 million pre-tax while increasing the liability for guaranteed lifetime income benefit payments by $77 million pre-tax as experience continues to emerge with slightly lowered lapsation, mortality, and Lifetime Income Benefit Rider utilization assumptions.
The combined net effect was a decrease in DAC and DSI amortization by $234 million pre-tax while increasing the reserve for guaranteed Lifetime Income Benefit payments by $159 million pre-tax.
The quarter included $7.6 million of additional revenues from reinsurance stemming from our Brookfield Reinsurance transaction.
Included in revenues is $3.7 million [Phonetic] of asset-liability management fees and $4.9 million reflecting amortization of deferred gain on a GAAP basis.
Average yield on invested assets was 3.91% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 3.51% in this year's second quarter.
The increase was attributable to an 18 basis points benefit from lower cash relative to invested assets, a 22 basis point increase from returns on partnerships and other investments accounted for at fair value, and 2 basis point increase from prepayments and other bulk [Phonetic] fee income.
Reflecting the in-force reinsurance transaction with Brookfield, cash and equivalents in the investment portfolio averaged $7 billion over the third quarter, down from $10 billion in this year's second quarter.
The aggregate cost of money for annuity liabilities was 151 basis points, down from 156 basis in the second quarter of this year.
The cost of money in the third quarter benefited from 8 basis points of hedging gains compared to 4 basis points of gains in the second quarter.
Brookfield in-force reinsurance transaction lowered the absolute cost of money for deferred annuities [Phonetic] in dollars by $12.9 million.
Investment spread in the third quarter was 240 basis points, up from 195 basis points from the second quarter.
Excluding prepayment income and hedging gains, adjusted spread in the third quarter was 220 basis points compared to 181 basis points for the second quarter.
Should the yields available to us decrease or the cost of money rise, we have the flexibility to reduce our rates, if necessary, and could decrease our cost of money by roughly 58 basis points if we reduced current rates to guaranteed minimums, unchanged from our second quarter call.
Excluding the effect of assumption revisions, the liability for Guaranteed Lifetime Income Benefit payments increased $43 million this quarter after a net positive experience and adjustments of $15 million relative to our modeled expectations.
The in-force reinsurance transaction with Brookfield lowered the expected accretion by $7 million while assumption revisions increased expected accretion by $2 million for a net of $5 million.
Deferred acquisition cost and deferred sales inducement amortization totaled $93 million for the quarter, $12 million less than modeled expectations due to strong index credits in the quarter, offset partly by higher than modeled interest margins.
The in-force reinsurance transaction with Brookfield lowered the expected level of amortization expense by $7 million, while assumption revisions lower expected amortization by an additional $21 million.
Other operating costs and expenses decreased to $57 million from $65 million in the second quarter.
Operating costs in the second quarter included $5 million of expenses associated with tenants' transition while third-quarter operating costs reflected $2 million of savings from the recapture of finance reserves that were then seeded to Brookfield.
We expect the refinancing of the remaining redundant reserves to be effective as of October 1, resulting in an additional $7 million of quarterly savings going forward.
At September 30, cash and equivalents at the holding company were in excess of target by approximately $300 million.
This is a solid sign of the progress made just in the past 12 months in becoming AEL 2.0.
