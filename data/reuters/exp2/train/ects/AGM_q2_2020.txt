Evaluating Farmer Mac, you should consider these risks and uncertainties as well as those described in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC in February as updated to discuss risks related to COVID-19 pandemic and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC today.
Outstanding business volume grew to $22 billion as we have provided $1.7 billion in new credit and that's a gross number -- $1.7 billion in new credit to rural America in the second quarter 2020.
Looking back over the last 12 months, our net business volume growth has increased significantly compared to the broader agriculture, real estate lending sector.
Turning to our financials, core earnings were a record $26.3 million for the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth to a sequential and on a year-over-year basis.
Net effective spread was 89 basis points in the second quarter, that's in line with our historical results and our business plan and the discussions we've had with you over many quarters.
Since March, we have approved 392 payment deferment requests related to COVID-19 and that's through July 31st of this year.
Those payment deferral requests have total principal balance of $408 million or put another way, 1.8% of total outstanding credit.
Outstanding business volume growth in the second quarter of 2020 was robust as multiple lines of business contributed to net outstanding growth of $502.8 million.
The quarter reflects record net volume growth in Farm & Ranch, USDA Securities, and rural utilities of a combined $748.7 million.
This growth was partially offset by a sequential decrease in long-term standby purchase commitments, loans held in trusts, and guaranteed securities of a combined $204.6 million, as well as a decrease in institutional credit of $41.3 million.
In our rural utilities line of business, loan purchase net volume grew $311.9 million during the quarter, compared to $98.1 million during the same quarter in 2019 due to increased loan purchase demand from our two primary counterparties in the rural utilities line of business, CoBank and National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation.
Loan purchase net growth in our foundational Farm & Ranch line of business was $363.7 million during the quarter, over two times greater than the same period in 2019, reflecting our ability to attract and retain borrowers in this low interest rate environment, but also our ability to significantly increase our product utilization across an expanding seller network.
Active Farm & Ranch sellers, meaning a lender that is transacted with Farmer Mac this year through a loan sale have increased by over 40% from the same period in 2019.
In addition, the number of agricultural lenders selling Farmer Mac more than $1 million in loans this year has more than doubled from the same period last year.
Specifically, Farmer Mac's agricultural mortgage loan portfolio grew 18% over the last 12 months compared to the year-over-year growth rate of the total agricultural mortgage loan market of approximately 3% through March 2020.
Turning to our USDA securities line of business, we achieved record gross loan purchase volume this quarter of $224 million, outpacing last quarter's performance by $76 million.
Our institutional credit line of business experienced a net decrease of $41.3 million during the quarter, primarily due to the maturity of two bonds from one large counterparty, as well as regular scheduled amortization payments on bonds from another large counterparty, partially offset by continued strong growth in smaller fund volumes.
In the coming months, we will be expanding our Ag Express score card loan product by doubling the eligible loan size that sellers can offer to their borrowers from $750,000 to $1.5 million.
In the second quarter 2020, US gross domestic product contracted at the fastest pace in history, falling at an annualized rate of 32.9% according to estimates from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.
According to data from the US Census Bureau, US consumer spending on food services away from the home fell to 50% of pre-COVID levels in April.
Drivers returned to the road in May and June and ethanol production rebounded to nearly 90% of pre-COVID levels by July.
USDA distributed over $6.6 billion in direct payments to Farmers & Ranchers in June and July through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program or CFAP.
And the small business administration has distributed more than $7.9 billion in Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP loans to businesses involved in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting.
Heading into August, the USDA had nearly $24 billion in authorized and unused funding to support the sector through the pandemic.
Despite economic headwinds, credit quality at Farmer Mac loan portfolio continues to be strong, loans past due by 90 days or more decreased in the second quarter of 2020 to 0.86% of the outstanding Farm & Ranch portfolio, or 0.31% across all four lines of business.
Individual loan risk rating held steady in the second quarter of 2020 with substandard loans totaling $310 million across all line -- all lines of business loans and guarantees.
This volume is spread across 48 commodities in 219 counties in 39 states.
And this is evidenced in our overall lower rates of funding this quarter of 1.29% versus 1.97% in the first quarter.
We maintained a total cash position of over $800 million as of June 30.
Additionally, we opportunistically raised $79.5 million of non-cumulative perpetual Series E Preferred Stock, which further enhanced our capital position this quarter.
This issuance strengthened our Tier 1 capital position and positions us well for various growth initiatives.
Our core earnings increased $2.7 million to $26.3 million for second quarter 2020, compared to $23.6 million in second quarter 2019.
Net effective spread was $46.5 million in second quarter 2020, compared to $41.4 million in the same period last year.
Net effective spread in percentage terms, or basis points was 89 this quarter, and this was held well within our target range of plus or minus 5 basis points of 90 basis points.
However, the weightage toward more cash has resulted in a slight reduction of 2 basis points in our net effective spread.
The $2.7 million year-over-year increase in core earnings was primarily due to a $4 million after tax increase in net effective spread, a $300,000 after tax decrease in the total provision for losses and these increases were partially offset by $1.6 million after tax increase in operating expense.
Our operating expenses increased by 16% in second quarter 2020 compared to second quarter 2019.
However, of note, both compensation and G&A expenses were lower than the first quarter of 2020 by $2.1 million.
The provision to the allowance for loan losses of $500,000 recorded this quarter was largely attributable to new loan volume in our rural utilities portfolio.
Specifically, improvements in commodity prices and expectations for stable farmland values primarily contributed to a $1.7 million release in Farm & Ranch portfolio related allowance for losses.
Our earnings were also substantially higher than first quarter 2020 and increased by $6.2 million on an after tax basis.
This increase was driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses of $3 million after tax, higher net effective spread of $1.8 million after tax and a reduction in our operating expenses relative to the prior quarter of $1.7 million after tax.
Turing to capital now, we continue to remain very well capitalized, Farmer Mac's $916 million of core capital as of June 30, 2020 exceeded our statutory requirements by $248 million, or 37%.
This compares to $815 million of core capital as of March 31, which exceeded our statutory requirement by $166 million, or 25%.
The increase in capital from the prior quarter is primarily due to the previously mentioned issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, as well as a $23 million increase in retained earnings in second quarter 2020.
Our liquidity remains strong and it far exceeds our regulatory requirement by 122 days.
More complete information about Farmer Mac's second quarter 2020 performance is in the 10-Q we filed today with the SEC.
