Sales of $2.2 billion were up from $2.0 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share of $3.20 was up significantly from $1.30 in the second quarter of last year and pension adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.05.
New contract awards during the quarter were approximately $1.2 billion, resulting in a backlog of approximately $48 billion, of which approximately $24 billion is funded.
Of note, the budget requests continued recapitalization of the nation's strategic ballistic missile submarine fleet and supported funding for CVN 80 and CVN 81 forward class aircraft carriers, two Virginia-class submarines, one DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and LHA 9.
We were also pleased that a second DDG 51 class destroyer was included as the number one priority on the Navy's unfunded requirements list for fiscal year 2022, and we look forward to working closely with the Congress during the FY '22 markup process to urge support for the second DDG and other critical priorities, including the efficient production of amphibious warships.
At Ingalls, the team received a contract modification from the U.S. Navy for $107 million to provide additional long-lead time material and advanced procurement activities for amphibious assault ship LHA 9, which increases current funding on this ship to approximately $490 million.
Regarding the potential bundled acquisition of LHA nine with LPD 32 and 33, discussions are ongoing with the customer.
In addition, Ingalls was awarded a contract with a potential total value of $724 million over seven years for planning yard services in support of a variety of in-service amphibious class ships, including the LPD 17 San Antonio class and LHA six America class.
On the DDG program, the team successfully launched the first Flight III Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer, DDG 125, Jack H Lucas in June.
And DDG 121, Frankie Peterson Jr. is expected to conduct sea trials later this year.
On the LPD program, LPD 28 Fort Lauderdale is on track to conduct sea trials during the fourth quarter and LPD 29 Richard M. McCool Jr. continues to achieve production milestones in support of launch early next year.
CVN-79 Kennedy is approximately 83% complete, and the team remains focused on compartment completion and key propulsion plant milestones.
CVN 73 USS George Washington is approximately 90% complete, and the team remains focused on achieving key test program milestones to support redelivery to the Navy, which is planned for next year.
On the DCS program, the team completed shipment of the final module of SSN 797 Iowa during the quarter.
In addition, SSN 794 Montana remains on track for delivery to the Navy later this year, and SSN 796 New Jersey remains on track to achieve the float-off milestones as planned in the second half of this year.
And finally, on the submarine fleet support program, SSN 725 Helena is on track for redelivery to the Navy later this year.
At Technical Solutions, contract awards of REMUS 300 unmanned underwater vehicles during the quarter to the U.S. Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy affirmed the flexibility and modularity of these units.
TS was also recently awarded a $273 million cost plus fixed fee indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to support maintenance and planning for the overhaul and repair of equipment and systems associated with the Navy aircraft carriers and West Coast Navy surface ships.
In addition, TS was awarded a contract with a 1-year base period and four 1-year options with a total potential value of $346 million to provide a variety of aircraft and operational support services for USAFRICOM, included planning, management, maintenance, logistics and airlift airdrop services and emergency medical care.
Segment operating income for the quarter of $169 million increased $174 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment operating margin of 7.6% compared to a segment operating margin of negative 0.2% of the second quarter of 2020.
Operating income for the quarter of $128 million increased by $71 million from the second quarter of 2020 and operating margin of 5.7% increased 293 basis points.
The tax rate in the quarter was approximately 19.9% compared to 18.5% in the second quarter of 2020.
Net earnings in the quarter were $129 million compared to $53 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.20 compared to $1.30 in the second quarter of 2020.
Excluding the impacts of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.05 compared to a loss of $0.49 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
Cash from operations was $96 million in the quarter, and net capital expenditures were $73 million or 3.3% of revenues resulting in free cash flow of $23 million.
This compares to cash from operations of $201 million and $75 million of net capital expenditures or free cash flow of $126 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were $12 million in the quarter, principally related to postretirement benefits.
During the second quarter, we paid dividends of $1.14 per share or $46 million and repurchased approximately 95,000 shares at a cost of $20 million.
Ingalls revenues in the quarter of $670 million increased $48 million or 7.7% from the same period last year, driven primarily by higher revenues on the DDG program and amphibious assault ships partially offset by lower revenues on the NSC program.
Ingalls operating income of $80 million and margin of 11.9% in the quarter were up from the second quarter of 2020, driven by the recognition of a capital investment related incentive for the DDG program that was recognized in DDG-125 as well as higher risk retirement from the LHA 8, LP 28 and LP 29 ships.
Newport News revenues of $1.4 billion in the quarter increased $241 million or 21.5% from the same period last year due to higher revenues in both the submarine and aircraft carry construction.
Newport News operating income of $76 million and margin of 5.6% in the quarter were up year-over-year, primarily due to the impacts related to the Virginia class performance and COVID in the prior year period.
Now to Technical Solutions on slide 10.
Technical Solutions revenues of $237 million in the quarter decreased 25.9% from the same period last year mainly due to the divestiture of the oil and gas business and the contribution of the San Diego shipyard through a joint venture in the first quarter of this year as well as lower volumes in unmanned systems, partially offset by increases in volumes in the Defense and Federal Solutions.
Technical Solutions operating income of $13 million in the quarter compares to income of $9 million in the second quarter of 2020.
Given the strong performance in the first half of the year, we now expect that the shipbuilding margin for the full year will be in the 7.5% to 8% range.
We continue to expect the Alion acquisition will close in the coming weeks and that we will incur approximately $25 million of onetime pre-tax transaction and financing-related expenses in 2021.
We completed the syndication of the term loan component of the acquisition funding earlier this week, and more details of the specifics are available in the 10-Q.
