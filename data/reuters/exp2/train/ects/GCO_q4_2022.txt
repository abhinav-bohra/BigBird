We grew revenue more than 35% over last year and 10% over fiscal '20.
Gross margin expansion and meaningful expense leverage drove record operating income for our footwear businesses as we achieved an operating margin above 6%.
We generated $240 million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $80 million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to 9% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $7.62, an increase of more than 65% over fiscal '20.
Additional highlights include capitalizing on the accelerated shift to online spending and holding on to last year's almost 75% gain to reach almost $0.5 billion of digital sales, growing our branded wholesale business by almost $90 million versus two years ago, while improving profitability, adding new licenses and strengthening retail partnerships, and increasing store revenues over 40% from last year and nearly achieving fiscal '20 levels despite having 55 fewer stores.
We are not dependent on anyone brand for the majority of our revenue, but rather 10 or more brands typically constitute 80% of what we sell.
Q4 highlights include revenue up 14% over last year and 7% over two years ago.
Remarkably, we achieved this despite overall inventory being down almost 20% versus last year and down by one-third compared with the fourth quarter two years ago during the key holiday period.
With much more limited promotional activity, coupled with price increases, full-price selling was very strong, fueling a 300-plus basis point increase in gross margin versus last year, and a 200 basis point increase compared to two years ago, much stronger than expected.
Higher sales and this better-than-expected gross margin resulted in double-digit operating income expansion over pre-pandemic levels and record adjusted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of more than 25% compared to last year's holiday season and 13% compared to two years ago.
From a channel perspective, the power of our omnichannel strategy was on full display in the fourth quarter as consumer appetite to shop in person, especially in the days leading up to Christmas, drove an almost 20% increase in-store sales over the year-ago period.
We saw the biggest shift to in-store shopping in the U.K. as Schuh stores were open 100% of the quarter compared to roughly only a third of the days last year.
Despite the strong in-store sales in both Journeys and Schuh, we held on to almost 90% of last year's digital sales in total.
All of Journeys' Top 10 brands experienced year-over-year growth in fiscal '22 with most notching significant gains.
Finally, the Journeys team continues to live its core values of being a family with an attitude that cares, partnering during the holidays with nonprofit candidates and customers at the register for its largest national community activation, and donating $600,000 for bikes for underserved youth across the United States.
As part of this initiative, Journeys' headquarters employees built and donated 300 bikes and helmets to two Nashville elementary schools just in time for the holidays.
We were incredibly pleased with holiday results as Schuh capitalized on pent-up consumer demand and delivered Q4 constant currency revenue up more than 30% versus last year and 12% versus two years ago.
U.K. customers were more comfortable shopping in person, leading to better in-store traffic, Schuh retained much of its digital gains from when stores were closed last year, resulting in a Q4 46% digital penetration.
New product story marketing campaigns have been very effective, and we've seen the most growth in our digital channel, up 14% compared to Q4 last year, and growth in our under-35 customer base, up 30% in Q4.
Much stronger demand and supply constraints pushed inventory more than 50% below pre-pandemic levels, hampering our ability to capture all of the demand during the holidays and return J&M to pre-pandemic sales.
Rounding out the discussion, momentum for Licensed Brands accelerated as the year progressed, notching impressive sales growth of 70% over last year as we successfully turned around the business and capitalized on the new capabilities we obtained with the Togast acquisition.
We expect adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '23 to be between $7 and $7.75 and believe somewhere close to the middle of the range is where the year will land.
While there are a number of variables at play, our results over what has been a very volatile past 24 months gives me great confidence in our team's ability to execute.
Consolidated revenue was $728 million, up 7% compared to fiscal '20.
Journeys grew 2%, while Schuh grew 12% on a constant currency basis, and we more than tripled our licensed brands business.
As for J&M, the quarter started off strong in November, but supply chain challenges led to a significant lack of inventory, which led to J&M sales being down 12% for the quarter.
And while we drove robust growth in the store channel, sales remained 4% below fiscal year '20, as scarcity of inventory impeded sales.
Worth noting as well is that we ended the quarter with 55 fewer stores than we had in fiscal year '20 as we optimized our store footprint.
On a year-over-year comp basis, however, total company comp-store sales were up 10% and were driven by comp sales of 6% at Journeys, 22% at Schuh, and 55% at J&M.
Finally, e-commerce sales were up 36% to fiscal '20 and accounted for 22% of total retail sales, up from 17% in fiscal year '20, while we also held on to 88% of last year's gains even while having the majority of our stores open during the quarter.
We were again very pleased with gross margins, which were up 310 basis points to last year and 200 basis points versus two years ago.
Increased logistics costs put approximately 120 basis points or $9 million of pressure on Q4 gross margin, and were the greatest drag in our branded businesses.
Journeys' and Schuh's gross margins were up 330 and 250 basis points, respectively, to fiscal year '20, driven by more full-price selling and higher footwear ASPs.
J&M's gross margin was up 420 basis points to fiscal '20, also benefiting from strong full-price selling and price increases, which also drove the release of slow-moving inventory reserves.
Finally, licensed brands' gross margin was down 190 basis points to fiscal year '20, as we experienced almost 1,000 basis points or almost $5 million of pressure from additional logistics costs, which more than offset margin improvements in the business.
Adjusted SG&A expense was 39.8%, which was 170 basis points more than fiscal '20 as deleverage from investments in marketing and higher incentive compensation more than offset leverage in occupancy and selling salaries.
Regarding our rent reduction efforts for fiscal '22, we negotiated permanent reductions through 181 renewals, which achieved a 16% reduction in rent expense in North America on a straight-line basis.
This was on top of a 22% reduction for 123 renewals last year.
With 45% of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next couple of years, this continues to remain a key priority.
Last quarter, we reported that we had identified the full amount of our $25 million to $30 million cost savings target.
In summary, fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $66 million, a 9.1% operating margin, compared to $59 million or 8.8% for fiscal year '20.
Versus last year, operating income improved by $2 million or 2.6%.
As Mimi mentioned, for the fiscal year, we achieved north of a 6% operating margin, which was an important milestone in our long-range plan.
For the quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP tax rate was 25%, which compares favorably to the 37% last year due to the impact of the Cares Act tax provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21.
This resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.48 for the quarter, which compares to $2.76 last year and $3.09 in fiscal '20.
Q4 total ending inventory was down 24%, compared to fiscal '20 on sales that were up 7%.
At the end of the quarter, all our business experienced inventory shortfalls versus fiscal '20 with the most impacted in Journeys and J&M, which were down 20% and 39%, respectively.
Our strong net cash position of $305 million, an increase of over $120 million versus last year, was driven by our strong operating performance.
This strong performance and our confidence in the business enabled us to continue to return cash to our shareholders through the repurchase of 840,000 shares of stock for $52 million at an average price of $62.22 per share during the quarter.
Total fiscal '22 share repurchases were approximately 1.36 million shares or 9% of outstanding shares at a cost of approximately $82.8 million and at an average price of $60.88 per share, which effectively used up our September 2019 $100 million share repurchase authorization.
As a reminder, to continue to support our capital allocation strategy, we recently announced the approval of an additional $100 million repurchase authorization in February of this year, which represents our current availability.
Capital expenditures were $19 million, including our new headquarters, and depreciation and amortization was $11 million.
We opened two stores and closed 11 during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 1,425 total stores.
After considering these factors, we expect fiscal year '23 sales to grow 2% to 4%.
For adjusted earnings per share, we expect a range of $7 to $7.75 per share with our best current expectation that earnings per share will be near the midpoint of the range.
Regarding gross margins, we expect gross margin rates to come down versus last year by roughly 40 to 50 basis points due mainly to increased markdown activity in the quarters in which markdowns normally occur as compared to essentially no promotional activity last year.
We expect adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the range of 10 to 40 basis points.
Our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases for the fiscal year, which results in fiscal '23 average shares outstanding of approximately 13.4 million, but we can repurchase opportunistically with availability under our most recent authorization.
Furthermore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 28%.
The investments we have made paid huge dividends and contributed meaningfully to our results these past two years as we achieved e-commerce sales growth of almost 80% over this time.
We expect marketing to be up more than 60% versus pre-pandemic spending, in large part, driven by these digital marketing increases.
Our research has told us that over 30% of Journeys' target consumers visit local non-mall shopping centers two to three times per month and enjoy the convenience of shopping closer to home, combined with enhanced omnichannel services like easier curbside pickup.
As such, we are expanding our portfolio of Journeys' non-mall locations and opening up to 30 new locations this year.
Because of the trusted relationship we have with our customers and their parents and the efforts to capture first-party data in our stores, we are currently able to identify 80%-plus of our Journeys and J&M customers.
