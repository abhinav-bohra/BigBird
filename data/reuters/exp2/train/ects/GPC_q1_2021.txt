In addition, industrial production increased by 2.5% in the first quarter, the third consecutive quarter of expansion, following the significant downturn in the second quarter of 2020.
The strengthening sales environment, along with our initiatives to drive growth and control cost produced an 80 basis point margin improvement with segment profit margin at 8.3% versus 7.5% last year.
That said, we are seeing more pricing activity and expect another year of 1% to 2% price inflation from our suppliers.
Since 1928, we have been giving back to communities and causes that make a difference and that legacy continues in 2021.
One solid example is the success the US Industrial team enjoyed with recent facility automation investments that delivered a 500% labor productivity improvement.
A few select highlights include the alignment of talent 100% dedicated to developing and executing EV strategies, product and category management strategies with existing and new SKUs, global supplier councils with existing strategic partners, advisory groups leveraging our 25,000 global repair center relationships and partnerships with strategic EV market participants.
