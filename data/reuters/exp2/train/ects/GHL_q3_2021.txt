We reported third quarter revenue of $88.6 million and earnings per share of $0.85.

Revenue for the year-to-date is up 17% from the same period last year.
Our compensation ratio of 50% for the quarter brought down the year-to-date ratio to 65%, and our objective is to bring that ratio down further by year-end, while still paying our team increased compensation in absolute dollars.
We continue to expect our annual tax rate to be in the mid-20% range before adjusting for charges relating to changes in the value of restricted stock upon vesting.
