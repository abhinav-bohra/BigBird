After realizing more than $10 million of synergies last year, we anticipate at least another $20 million this year.
The Rail segment recorded its highest quarterly profit in two years, and we expect EBITDA growth to exceed 60% for the full year.
Last year, Harsco recycled or repurposed over 75% of the material that we processed and we continue to see increases in our ESG ratings.
Harsco's revenues totaled $570 million and adjusted EBITDA reached $78 million in the second quarter outperforming the prior year and sequential quarters.
Harsco consolidated revenues increased 27% compared with the second quarter of 2020 and 8% compared with the first quarter of 2021.
Harsco's adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.28, and this figure compares favorably to adjusted earnings per share of $0.13 in the prior year quarter and is above the guidance range of $0.21 to $0.27 we provided in May.
Lastly, our free cash flow for the quarter of $6 million was consistent with our expectations.
Revenues totaled $273 million and adjusted EBITDA was $58 million.
These results compare favorably to the prior year quarter when EBITDA totaled $40 million.
Our quarterly margin improved to just over 21%.
Liquid steel tonnage, or LST, increased roughly 25% versus the prior year, and we expect to benefit from increased production as the global economy continues to improve.
Our customers operated at less than 80% of capacity in Q2, which leaves room for further improvement in service levels in the future.
For the quarter, revenues were $196 million, and adjusted EBITDA totaled $18 million.
Compared to the second quarter of 2020, revenues increased 21% with both our contaminated and hazardous materials businesses contributing higher revenues.
Integration benefits totaled roughly $5 million in the quarter versus the prior year period.
And overall, our integration efforts are progressing well with us on track to realize $20 million of benefits this year.
Lastly, on Clean Earth, I'd highlight that our year-to-date free cash flow now totals $24 million.
This total represents more than 70% of its EBITDA and reflects the positive results and financial characteristics of this business.
Rail revenues totaled $101 million, up 24% from the prior year quarter and the segment's adjusted EBITDA totaled $10 million in the second quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be within a range of $295 million to $310 million.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be within a range of $0.82 and $0.96 and we expect free cash flow of $35 million to $55 million for the year.
Let me conclude on slide 10 with our third quarter guidance.
Q3 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $75 million to $81 million.
