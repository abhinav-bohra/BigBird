Total revenue declined $190,000 compared with last year's fourth quarter.
Mortgage interest income increased $226,000 due to the funding of expansion and renovation projects.
Interest expense decreased $490,000 due to lower outstanding balances and interest rates under our line of credit in the fourth quarter of 2020 and scheduled principal payments on our senior unsecured notes.
Property tax expense decreased $809,000, primarily due to the timing of Senior Lifestyle property tax escrow receipts and the payment of related taxes.
G&A expense increased $675,000 compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the reimbursement of legal fees from Senior Care in the prior-year period as well as the timing of certain expenditures.
Income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $270,000 due to a dissolution in 2019 of a preferred equity investment in a joint venture, offset by two preferred equity investments we made in 2020.

At December 31, 2020, Senior Lifestyle's unaccrued delinquent rent balance was $1 million.
Net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased by $5 million, primarily resulting from acquisitions and completed development projects, rent increases, lower interest expense, the prior year's loss on sale, and the fourth quarter of 2019's $5.5 million impairment charge.
Offsets included the $3 million impairment charge, decreased rent related to the Preferred Care property sales, abated and deferred rent net of repayment, a decrease in property tax revenue, the 2019 receipt of 2018 past due rent from Senior Care, and the fourth quarter 2019 gain from insurance proceeds.

The $0.02 increase in FFO excluding the gain was due to lower weighted average shares outstanding in 2020, resulting from the purchase of shares in the first quarter of 2020 under our share buyback program.
