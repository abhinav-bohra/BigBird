Also note that both our adjusted results and full year guidance exclude our build-to-print actuation product line that supported the 737 MAX program as well as our German valves business, which was classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We experienced a strong 12% increase in overall sales, of which 4% was organic.
Our A&D markets improved 15%, reflecting solid growth in commercial aerospace, naval defense and yet another quarter of strong performance from our PacStar acquisition.
Looking at our profitability, adjusted operating income improved 12% with adjusted operating margins strong at 17.5%, reflecting higher sales and operating income across all our segments as well as the benefits of our operational excellence initiatives.
It's important to note that this strong performance was achieved while we continue to invest strategically with a $4 million incremental investment in research and development as compared to the prior year.
As a result, we are on track to invest $12 million in incremental R&D this year to support our future organic growth initiatives.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.88 in the third quarter, which was slightly above our expectations due to the strong operational performance and the benefits of our consistent share repurchase activity.
Free cash flow was similarly strong, up 76% compared with the prior year, with strong free cash flow conversion that exceeded 125% and keeps us on track to achieve our long-term objectives.
We achieved 13% growth, and book-to-bill exceeded onetime sales, driven by increases within each of our three segments.
Digging a little deeper, we experienced solid growth of 7% in our A&D market orders as well as a robust growth of 25% in our commercial market, providing continued support to our strong backlog.
We immediately and opportunistically began to repurchase $200 million of our stock in mid-September.
I'm pleased to report that we recently completed this program and bought back more than 1.5 million shares.
We are on track to complete at least $250 million of share repurchases in 2021, and we remain well positioned for the continued return of capital to our shareholders going forward with $350 million of remaining authorization.
We now expect to achieve between $7.20 and $7.35, essentially double-digit growth compared with the prior year based on our strong year-to-date performance and the benefit of our repurchase activity.
Sales increased 14% in the third quarter, led by strong increases in demand for our products and services in both commercial aerospace and general industrial markets.
Within the segment's commercial aerospace market, sales increased more than 20% year-over-year as we experienced improved OEM demand on Narrowbody aircraft as well as a solid increase in aftermarket sales.
Adjusted operating income increased 34% while adjusted operating margin increased 240 basis points to 15.7%.
In the Defense Electronics segment, revenues increased 22% in the third quarter, principally reflecting the contribution from our PacStar acquisition.
Lower organic sales reflect the timing on various C5ISR programs in aerospace defense as we experienced a shift of about $10 million to $15 million in lower-margin system sales into the fourth quarter, which was mainly due to the global shortage and electronic components.
This segment's third quarter operating margin reflected favorable mix for our higher margin embedded computing revenues, which was more than offset by $4 million in incremental R&D investments and about $1 million in unfavorable FX.
Next, in the Naval & Power segment, revenues increased 3% in the third quarter, led by higher sales of naval nuclear propulsion equipment and higher valve sales to process markets where we continue to experience strong demand.
This segment's adjusted operating income increased 4% while adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.6%, reflecting favorable absorption on sales and approximately $2 million in restructuring savings.
To sum up the third quarter results, overall, both sales and adjusted operating income increased 12%.
And across Curtiss-Wright, we drove 10 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion while adding $4 million in incremental R&D investments, which represents a 70 basis point headwind on our overall profitability.
I'll begin with our end market sales outlook, where we continue to expect total Curtiss-Wright sales growth of 7% to 9%, of which 2% to 4% is organic.
Starting with naval defense, our guidance remains unchanged at flat to up 2%, and we continue to see strong order activity for our nuclear propulsion equipment on critical naval platforms.
Next, a few comments about our commercial markets where overall sales growth remains unchanged at 6% to 8%.
We expect adjusted operating income growth of 9% to 12% and adjusted operating margin growth of 40 to 50 basis points to a range of 16.7% to 16.8%.
I'll begin in the Aerospace & Industrial segment where we're expecting operating income to grow 17% to 21% while operating margin is projected to increase 180 to 200 basis points, keeping us on track to exceed 2019 profitability levels this year.
As we noted earlier, we experienced a $10 million to $15 million shift in revenue from the third into the fourth quarter based upon the timing and receipt of electronic components.
Regarding the segment's profitability, it's important to note that we are maintaining our outlook for operating income despite the revenue timing issues and our $8 million year-over-year increase in strategic investments in R&D.
Lastly, in the Naval & Power segment, our guidance remains unchanged, and we continue to expect 20 to 30 basis points of margin expansion on solid sales growth despite the wind down of the CAP1000 program.
Continuing with our financial outlook, where we increased the bottom end of our full year 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to a new range of $7.20 to $7.35, which reflects growth of 9% to 12%, in line with our growth in operating income.
And lastly, based on strong year-to-date free cash flow generation of $128 million, we remain on track to achieve our full year free cash flow guidance of $330 million to $360 million.
Led by high single-digit revenue growth, including the contribution from last year's PacStar acquisition, we expect to generate 9% to 12% growth in both operating income and diluted earnings per share this year.
Our 2021 operating margin guidance of 16.7% to 16.8% reflects our solid execution and ongoing focus on operational excellence.
We expect to achieve those results while investing an additional $12 million or 40 basis points in strategic R&D to facilitate future organic growth.
In addition, our adjusted free cash flow remains strong, and we are on track to achieve our ninth consecutive year of greater than 100% free cash flow conversion.
And our commercial orders have been very resilient, reflecting book-to-bill of 1.1 times sales year-to-date.
