I think, obviously, you can see from the headlines on slide three, that's probably one of the best quarters in Pioneer's 25-year history, which is coming up next year, our 25th year anniversary.
It's hard to imagine a company like Pioneer thrown out just in one quarter, $1.1 billion in free cash flow, obviously, during the quarter.
And returning $880 million of that in regard to a dividend, including base plus variable.
Our dividend payments from the third quarter is $3.58 a share made up of $3.02 variable and $0.56 on the base.
Probably the big headline from the quarter, tremendous transaction for Pioneer divesting of our Delaware assets for $3.25 billion.
And when you add the $250 million recent divestiture from Glasscock County, that makes a total for the quarter of about $3.5 billion.
So we're increasing at over 10%.
But again, increasing our goals to 50% in greenhouse gas intensity reduction and 75% in regard to methane intensity.
A debt-to-EBITDA of 0.4 by the end of the year.
When you look at one of the later slides, with a dividend yield of about 11% going to 2022, growing at 5% a year, that gets us to that mid-teens total return.
Reinvestment rate of 50% to 60% when you look at next year.
It's really down in the 30% to 40% range.
When you look at free cash flow generation, our free cash flow generation next year will be up 88% from 2021.
When you look at a five year strip, we'll generate over $25 billion of free cash flow.
The mid-80s, and keep it flat for the next five years, we're over $35 billion of free cash flow.
As I mentioned in regard to our strong and growing annual base dividend, we went up over 10%.
We'll continue to look at increases over and above our growth rate of 5%.
Again, the variable dividend, up to 75% of previous quarter's free cash flow of deducting the base dividend.
We'll be distributing about 80% of free cash flow back to the shareholders.
Again, we restated we had a share repurchase program where we had spent about $900 million in 2019 and 2020.
We spent about $900 million and bought the stock back around $130 million.
If you go back in history, the other time we bought our stock was back in 2005, 2006 after we sold our deepwater assets.
We spent $1.1 billion at 45%.
We do think it's important over the next five years if we do generate $25 billion to $35 billion of free cash flow that we significantly reduce the share count over time.
I think the last key point here is that the fact our EBITDA will be up about 45% to 50% next year, primarily due to the full year of both acquisitions and secondly, with very minimal hedging in 2022.
Returning $1.6 billion in dividends in 2021, a three times increase from 2020.
So we're estimating something near about $20 per share total payout in 2022.
It will exceed all peers and majors in the S&P 500.
We're already at 8% just based on the one we declared for the fourth quarter of 2021.
When you look at next year, we'll be 11%.
And when you look over the rest of the peers, excluding DeWitt and Cotera, we're basically a 10 times dividend times or 10 higher over the rest of the peers.
When you look at the S&P 500, which is around 1.6%, we're over six times to seven times the S&P 500.
As Scott stated earlier, we are further strengthening our base dividend with an increase of greater than 10%, which is an acceleration of our 2022 base dividend increase.
Inclusive of this increase, as you can see in the graph, our five year base dividend compound annual growth rate of greater than 95% exceeds all peers and U.S. majors.
As a result of our high operational efficiencies and acquisition synergy capture, we expect 2021 cash cost to be approximately 30% lower than 2019 levels.
I'm going to start on slide 10, where we show our updated production guidance for 2021.
You'll see here that we've narrowed our full year production -- our oil production range to 356,000 to 359,000 barrels of oil per day and total production to 613,000 to 619,000 BOEs per day.
Turning to slide 11.
As you can see from the slide here, about $3.25 billion of cash consideration.
About 92,000 net acres is being sold.
And production currently is running about 50,000 BOEs per day.
And so if you -- once those wells are completed, first quarter, that will be about 55,000 BOEs a day of production once those are completed in the first quarter placed on production.
Post this transaction, it does return Pioneer to being 100% focused on our core acreage position in the high-margin, high-return Midland Basin.
Also, we did announce -- or closed in October, the 20,000 net acres sale of our Glasscock County acreage to Laredo for about $230 million, monetizing our long-dated inventory that we weren't going to get to for a while.
At the time of the sale, this acreage had -- was producing about 4,400 BOEs a day, or 2,600 barrels of oil per day.
So on a combined basis, we're divesting about $3.5 billion of assets in the fourth quarter this year, which will further strengthen our balance sheet.
So we're seeing 2022 production adjusted for the divestitures at 355,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil per day, or 630,000 to 640,000 BOEs per day.
This is expected to result in a 2022 annual oil growth rate consistent with our long-term investment framework of growing production between 0% and 5%.
We were expecting to spend about $250 million to $300 million in the Delaware Basin to grow production there starting in 2022.
I'm going to be picking up on slide 12.
Our 2021 plan remains unchanged and has set average between 22 and 24 rigs for the full year.
Drilling and completions continue their strong track record of efficiency gains with greater than 70% and 80% increases on their respective foot per day metrics when compared to 2017.
Our drilling and completions teams are also successfully executing on 15,000-foot laterals.
I'm going to move on to slide 13.
As you can see, Pioneer's 2019 starting point is lower than the majority of our peers' projected intensities for 2025 and 2030.
Pioneer's 2030 emissions intensity goals represent one of the most aggressive reduction targets in the industry, demonstrating continued progress on our trajectory to net zero.
Now moving to slide 14 and continuing with the same storyline from the previous slide.
Pioneer also produces extremely low emission intensity oil on a global scale, which will improve as we progress toward our 2030 reduction targets.
On slide number 15, we talked about our new targets.
We've had significant reduction from our baseline in '19 to '20, as indicated with our progress, 27%, 50 and 50.
Our new targets are 50% by 2030 for greenhouse gas emissions for both Scope one and 2, and 75% for methane.
And previously, it was 40%.
Also, 2020 flaring intensity was 0.2%, significantly less than our goal of 1%.
Again, we expect to end routine flaring, as defined by the World Bank, by 2030 with aspiration to accomplish it by 2025.
Going to slide number 16.
I'm still the only CEO in the industry that is 100% tied to performance shares.
Most of other executives, it's around 60%.
You can see that we've increased our targets on ESG and HSE up to 20% last year.
Goals are 100% aligned with shareholders' interest.
Enhancing shareholder value, Slide number 17.
Capital discipline, I mentioned that we'll be returning roughly -- or spending about 30% to 40% over the next several years is our reinvestment rate.
Return on capital to our shareholders I mentioned that we have about $25 billion to $35 billion in a couple of different price cases, strip and flat price.
We'll be returning about 80% of that back to shareholders, plus any buybacks that we do during that time period.
