First quarter revenue in the U.S. Services Segment increased 23.3% to $384.9 million.

The U.S. Federal Services Segment had approximately $4 million of revenue and profit shift out of the first quarter due to a delay in executing a contract.
The operating margin was 7.5%, which was slightly short of our expectations for a strong first quarter in this segment.
