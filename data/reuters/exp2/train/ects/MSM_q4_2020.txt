A lot more is coming on this shortly, but I'll first turn to the quarter, and we've provided some highlights on Slide 3.
Versus the prior year period, overall sales were down 11.3% or 12.7% on an average daily sales basis.
Gross margin was down 40 basis points and operating margin was 9.8% as compared to 10.7% in the prior year.
Excluding one-time adjustments, our operating margin was 11.2%, down just 30 basis points from 11.5% in the prior year due to implementing effective cost controls.
Sales of safety and janitorial products also continued growing, with year-over-year growth of roughly 20% each month on average and for the quarter.
National Accounts declined slightly more than 20%, while our core customers declined mid-teens and CCSG was down in the low double-digits.
And this caution is reflected in recent sentiment indices, such as the MBI, which remains negative on a rolling 12-month average.
Our fourth-quarter sales were $748 million, a decline of 11.3% versus the same quarter last year.
Our average daily sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $11.7 million, a decrease of 12.7% on an ADS basis versus the same quarter last year.
Our operating margin was 9.8% compared to 10.7% in the same period last year.
Excluding severance and other costs, our adjusted operating margin was 11.2% versus an adjusted 11.5% in the prior year.
Within our operating profits, Erik touched on the items impacting our gross margin, which was 41.6% or 40 basis points below the prior year.
Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $238 million or 31.9% of sales versus $263 million or 31.2% of sales in the prior year.
This also includes about $11.2 million of costs related to severance and the review of our operating model mentioned on previous calls.
This was the result of actions tied to our structural cost initiative and explains the severance costs in the quarter, which were $8.1 million of the $11.2 million.
Excluding those costs, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 30.4% in the prior year, excluding $6.7 million of costs related to severance, operating expenses were also 30.4% of sales.
Our results for the quarter reflect the swift cost containment measures we implemented due to COVID-19, including temporary reductions in variable hours, in executive and management salaries, temporary suspension of our 401(k) match, a hiring freeze, and virus-related travel restrictions.
For example, in our fiscal first quarter, we restored our 401(k) match.
All of this resulted in earnings per share of $0.94.
And adjusted for severance and other costs, earnings per share was $1.09.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7.
We achieved strong free cash flow of $171 million in the fourth quarter.
A key driver was the $32 million decrease in inventory from last quarter to $543 million.
Given the stabilizing environment, we paid down over $300 million of our revolving credit facility in August, as well as, $20 million of maturing private placement debt.
Our total debt as of the end of the fourth quarter was $619 million, comprised primarily of a $250 million balance on our revolving credit facility, $20 million of short-term fixed rate borrowings, and $345 million of long-term, fixed-rate borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents were $125 million, so our net debt was $494 million.
In September and October, we deployed our strong cash flow by paying down another $120 million of our revolving debt.
Turning to Slide 8.
I'll start with reaccelerating market share capture, which is on Slide 9.
Our target is to outgrow the markets in which we compete by at least 400 basis points over the cycle.
This is shown on Slide 10.
Looking over extended periods of time, average IP growth is in the 2% to 3% range.
So this implies MSC growth of at least 6% to 7% over a cycle.
And so our goal is to exit fiscal 2021 at roughly 200 basis points above IP.
We've begun this effort in earnest and plan to add about 25% to our metalworking specialist team over the course of the year.
E-commerce has long been a strength of ours and represents roughly 60% of our sales today.
I'll now turn to our second goal, as summarized on Slide 11, to deliver ROIC, return on invested capital, in the high teens within the next three years.
As you've heard me mention, we expect this initiative to deliver about 200 basis points in cost down on an operating expense-to-sales ratio basis over the next three years.
In fiscal '20, we reported operating expenses of $993 million.
As Erik mentioned, Mission Critical includes growth investment, and that will be in the range of about $15 million in our first year of the growth program which is 2021.
This will be more than offset by total structural Mission Critical savings in 2021 in the range of $25 million.
And by the way, this is in addition to approximately $20 million of savings that we've already achieved in 2020.
On gross margin, we expect the full year to be flat to down 50 basis points year over year.
An operating margin framework is shown on Slide 13 for GAAP and 14 for adjusted figures.
If sales are down slightly on an adjusted basis, we would expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.2%, plus or minus 20 basis points.
If sales are flat, we would expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.4%, plus or minus 20 basis points.
And finally, if sales are slightly up, we would expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.7%, plus or minus 20 basis points.
On the growth side of that equation, we're targeting growth rates of at least 400 basis points above market over the cycle by investing in the five growth levers I described earlier.
