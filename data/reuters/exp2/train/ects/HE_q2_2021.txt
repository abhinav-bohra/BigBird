Our consolidated net income for the quarter was $63.9 million with earnings per share of $0.58, 31% and 29%, respectively, above the same quarter last year.
This followed a great first quarter, and for the first half of the year, our consolidated net income and earnings per share were up 56% compared to the first half of 2020.

Governor Ige signed into law a bill to replace the state's light duty vehicles with a zero-emission fleet by 2035, consistent with our Utility's own fleet electrification goal and to allocate 3% of oil barrel tax revenues to finance construction of EV charging stations.
President Biden's recently announced goal of 50% of vehicle sales being electric by 2030 will also help accelerate our electrification efforts, which will benefit our customers, our environment and our clean energy transition.
The Bank's margin improved compared to the first quarter, benefiting from fees related to ASB CARES or Payment Protection Program, PPP loans, lower amortization of investment premiums and a continued record low cost of funds of 7 basis points.

Consolidated earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.45 in the same quarter last year, a 29% increase quarter-over-quarter.
Compared to the same time last year, our consolidated trailing 12-month ROE improved over 100 basis points to 10.5% and the Utility realized return on equity increased levels of 100 basis points to 8.9%.

On Slide 8, Utility net income of $41.9 million was comparable with second quarter 2020 results of $42.3 million.
The most significant variance drivers were $6 million of higher O&M expenses compared to the second quarter of last year.
The main factors that drove higher O&M included $3 million due to more generating facility overhauls.
We also had $2 million from lower bad debt expense in the second quarter of 2020 due to the recording of year-to-date amounts following the Commission's decision allowing deferral of COVID-19-related expenses last year; about $1 million from the write-off of a terminated agreement relating to a combined heat and power unit; and $1 million due to increase in an environmental reserve.
Of note, O&M increases were partially offset by $1 million from lower staffing levels and efficiency improvements.
We also had about $1 million higher in depreciation.
The higher O&M and depreciation were offset by $5 million in higher RAM revenues, Rate Adjustment Mechanism revenues.
$2 million of this increase related to a change in the timing for revenue recognition within the year with target revenues recognized on an annual basis remaining unchanged; $1 million from lower non-service pension costs due to the reset of pension costs included in rates as part of a final rate case decision; and $1 million lower expense -- lower Enterprise Resource Planning system implementation benefits to be passed on to customers as we have already fully delivered on our commitment to provide customer savings under this program for Hawaiian Electric.
We currently have approximately $26 million of COVID-related costs, primarily estimated bad debt expense and deferred regulatory asset account.
The Utility is on track to achieve savings to meet its annual $6.6 million commitment, which we started returning to customers on June 1.
We now expect capex to be in the $310 million to $335 million range for the year compared to our prior capex guidance of $335 million to $355 million.
While this means our forecasted rate base growth is now 3% to 4% from a 2020 base year, we don't expect this year's lower capex range to impact the long-term earnings growth.
We still expect to realize 4% to 5% Utility earnings growth, not including potential upside from PIMs starting in 2022, the first full year of PBR.
ASB's net income for the quarter was $30.3 million compared to $29.6 million last quarter and $14 million in the second quarter of 2020.
American grew net interest income, while non-interest income was lower compared to the same quarter last year, where we had higher gains on sale of securities, including a $7 million after-tax gain from the sale of Visa Class B restricted shares.
On Slide 12, ASB's net interest margin expanded slightly during the quarter to 2.98% from 2.95% in the first quarter.
We recognized $5 million in PPP fees in the second quarter as ASB continues to actively assist customers through the forgiveness process.
Total deferred fees as of June 30 were $9.6 million.
This quarter, we continue to see record low cost of funds at 0.07%, down 1 basis point from the linked quarter and 11 basis points from the prior year.
Overall, we still expect that NIM for the year will range from 2.8% to 3%.
In the second quarter, the allowance for credit losses declined $13.5 million, reflecting the improved local economy and credit quality with credit upgrades in the commercial loan portfolio, lower net charge-offs and lower reserve requirements related to the customer unsecured loan portfolio.
The Bank recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $12.2 million compared to a negative provision of $8.4 million in the first quarter and a provision expense of $15.1 million in the second quarter last year.
ASB's net charge-off ratio of 0.04% was the lowest since 2015.
This compared to 0.18% in the first quarter and 0.49% in the second quarter of 2020.
Non-accrual loans were 1.03%, up slightly compared to 1% in the first quarter and 0.86% in the prior year quarter.
Our allowance for credit losses to outstanding loans was 1.51% at quarter end.
The Bank has more than $4 billion in available liquidity from a combination of reliable resources.
ASB's Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8% was comfortably well above well-capitalized levels.
Given the current lower risk profile of our portfolio, we continue to target a Tier 1 leverage ratio in the 7.5% to 8% range to ensure competitive profitability metrics and growth of the ASB dividend, while maintaining strong -- a strong capital position.
We now expect Bank dividends of approximately $55 million to $65 million versus the previously estimated $50 million to $60 million.
Our revised Bank guidance is $0.79 to $0.94 per share, up from our prior guidance of $0.67 to $0.74.
This reflects our updated provision range of negative $15 million to negative $20 million.
As a result, we're increasing our consolidated earnings per share guidance to $2 to $2.20 per share.
