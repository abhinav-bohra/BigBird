Going to Slide 2.
Now moving to Slide 4 and a review of our third quarter results.
Now for the quarter, revenue was $810.3 million, a decrease of 8.4%.
Organic revenue excluding $8.9 million of storm restoration services in the quarter declined 9.4%.
As we deployed 1 gigabit wireline networks, wireless/wireline converged networks and wireless networks, this quarter reflected an increase in demand from one of our top five customers.
Gross margins were 18.7% of revenue, reflecting solid overall performance, offset in part by the continued impacts of the complexity of a large customer program.
General and administrative expenses were 7.7% reflecting tight cost controls and all of these factors produced adjusted EBITDA of $92.8 million, or 11.5% of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.06 compared to $0.88 in the year ago quarter.
Liquidity was strong as cash and availability under our credit facility was $587.1 million, this amount represents our highest level of liquidity ever.
Finally, we made significant progress in reducing net leverage as notional net debt declined $110 million during the quarter to $558.7 million, a reduction of over $467 million in just the last four quarters.
Now going to Slide 5.
These wireline networks are generally designed to provision 1 gigabit network speeds to individual consumers and businesses, either directly or wirelessly using 5G technologies.
We are providing program management, planning, engineering and design, aerial, underground and wireless construction and fulfillment services for 1 gigabit deployments.
Moving to Slide 6.
Organic revenue decreased 9.4%.
Our top five customers combined produced 71.6% of revenue, decreasing 15.4% organically, while all other customers increased 11.1% organically.
Verizon was our largest customer at 17.9% of total revenue or $144.8 million.
Revenue from Comcast was $143.6 million, or 17.7% of revenue.
Comcast was Dycom's second largest customer and grew 9% organically.
Lumen, formerly known as CenturyLink was our third largest customer at 16.6% of revenue or $134.4 million.
AT&T was our fourth largest customer at $118.9 million or 14.7% of revenue.
And finally, revenue from Windstream was $38.9 million or 4.8% of revenue.
Of note, fiber construction revenue from electric utilities exceeded $31 million in the quarter, approaching just less than 4% of total revenue.
In fact, over the last several years, we have meaningfully increased a long-term value of our maintenance and operations business, a trend which we believe will parallel our deployment of 1 gigabit wireline, direct and wireless/wireline converged networks as those deployments dramatically increase the amount of outside plant network that must be extended and maintained.
Now going to Slide 7.
Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $5.412 billion versus $6.441 billion at the end of the July 2020 quarter, declining approximately $1 billion.
Of this backlog, approximately $2.339 billion is expected to be completed in the next 12 months.
Headcount increased during the quarter to 14,154.
In addition, subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we executed contracts that resulted in our booking in excess of $740 million of backlog.
Going to Slide 8.
Contract revenues for Q3 were $810.3 million and organic revenue declined 9.4% for the quarter.
Storm work performed in Q3 '21 was $8.9 million compared to none in Q3 '20.
Adjusted EBITDA was $92.8 million, or 11.5% of revenue, reflecting 108 basis point improvement over Q3 '20.
Gross margins were at 18.7% in Q3 and increased 68 basis points from Q3 '20.
Compared to our expectations for the quarter, gross margins were approximately 100 basis points below the midpoint, this variance reflected impacts from customers whose capital expenditures were weighted toward the front half of the calendar year, including a large customer program, offset in part by improvements across the services performed for several of our top customers.
G&A expense improved 17 basis points compared to Q3 '20.
Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $1.06 in Q3 '21, compared to $0.88 in Q3 '20.
Now going to Slide 9.
Over the past four quarters, we have reduced notional net debt by $467.4 million, included in this decline was a $110.1 million reduction in Q3 from solid free cash flow.
We ended the quarter with $12 million of cash and equivalents, $85 million of revolver borrowings, $427.5 million of term loans, and $58.3 million principal amount of convertible notes outstanding.
As of Q3, our liquidity was strong at $587.1 million.
Cash flows from operations were robust at $111.9 million, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $279.4 million from prudent working capital management.
The combined DSOs of accounts receivable and net contract assets was at 127 days, which was in line with Q3 '20.
Capital expenditures were $3.5 million during Q3, net of disposal proceeds and gross capex was $9.4 million.
For the full fiscal year 2021, we expect net capex to range from $45 million to $55 million, which is a $15 million reduction from our prior outlook.
Going to Slide 10.
For Q4 2021, which includes an additional week of operations due to the company's 52 to 53-week fiscal year, the company expects modestly lower contract revenues with margins that range from in-line to modestly higher as compared to Q4 2020.
Moving to Slide 11.
Telephone companies are deploying fiber to the home to enable 1 gigabit high-speed connections.
