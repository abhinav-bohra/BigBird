We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for the 2020 year filed with the SEC as well as the risk factors listed in our Form 10-Q and our Form 8-K filings with the SEC.
Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.40, with adjusted net income of $199 million and premium revenue of $6.6 billion.
The 88.4% medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related medical cost challenges that increased the ratio by 110 basis points.
The net effect of COVID decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1.
We managed to a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio, reflecting continued discipline in cost management, which allowed us to harvest the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth.
We produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 2.9%, meeting our second quarter expectations.
Our six month year-to-date performance, highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 7% adjusted G&A ratio and a 3.4% after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our year-to-date expectations.
This allowed us to produce, as projected, 60% of our full year earnings guidance in the first half of the year.
And we accomplished all of this as we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue.
In the second quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.6 billion, a 4% increase over the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our portfolio.
We ended the quarter with approximately 4.7 million members, an increase of 91,000 members over the first quarter of 2021.
Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.9 million members, an increase of 69,000 over the first quarter of 2021.
Our Medicare membership was 130,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4,000, and in line with our growth plan.
Our Marketplace membership were 638,000 at the end of the quarter, representing growth of 18,000 over the first quarter of 2021 due to lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the extended open enrollment period.
Our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89%.
Our Medicare results were excellent, having posted a medical care ratio of 87.6%.
Our Marketplace results have been significantly impacted by direct cost of COVID-related care as we posted a medical care ratio of 84.8% in the quarter.
With nearly 500 basis points of pressure on the MCR in each of the first two quarters, we can and should achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins as the pandemic subsides.
For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $25 billion, a 37% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance.
Recall, that for each month the public health emergency has extended, beyond the month of September, it increases our full year revenue outlook by $150 million.
We expect to end 2021 with approximately 590,000 marketplace members.
We are raising our full year 2021 earnings guidance and now expect to end the year with adjusted earnings of no less than $13.25 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of no less than $13 per share.
We remain on track for full year after-tax margins of at least 3%.
Specifically, the increase to our 2021 earnings guidance reflects our underlying outperformance, the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, offset by a $1 increase in the net cost of COVID, which we now expect to be $2.50 per share for the full year.
With the increased outlook for the net negative effect of COVID, our incremental embedded earnings power is now more at $5 above our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance.
In short, our pro forma run rate after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints would produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens and an after-tax margin of approximately 4%.
As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues.
The net effect of COVID negatively impacted second quarter results by $77 million or approximately $1 a share.
This increased the second quarter MCR by 110 basis points to 88.4%.
In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $25 million and accounted for a 40 basis point increase that is included within our reported 89% MCR.
The first quarter Medicaid MCR had a 150-basis-point benefit due to COVID, which substantially explains the sequential increase in MCR.
In Medicare, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $17 million, increasing the MCR by 200 basis points to 87.6% in the quarter.
The first quarter, Medicare MCR was increased by 400 basis points due to COVID.
In Marketplace, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $35 million, increasing the MCR by 480 basis points.
The first quarter Marketplace MCR included a similar impact from the net effect of COVID, which increased the first quarter MCR by approximately 500 basis points.
We received $145 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $564 million at the end of the quarter.
After funding our announced pending acquisitions, we will have year-end acquisition capacity of over $1.4 billion.
At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions, this gives us the ability to drive $3 billion to $4 billion in annualized revenue growth.
Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense, unchanged from the first quarter.
Debt at the end of the quarter is 2.2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA.
Our debt-to-cap ratio was 50%.
However, on a net debt basis, net of parent company cash, these ratios fall to 1.7 times and 43%, respectively.
We raised full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13.25 per share, which reflects the following: our underlying outperformance, an increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the net effect of COVID expectations, which has increased by $1 per share and is now expected to be approximately $2.50 per share for the full year, and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining six months of the year due to the COVID pandemic.
As Joe discussed, we believe the incremental embedded earnings power of the company is in excess of $5.
The increased net effect of COVID, which is now expected to create a $2.50 per share decrease that should dissipate as the pandemic subsides.
Medicare risk score disruption that created approximately $1 a share overhang; and as we obtain our target margins on Magellan Complete Care and Kentucky, and once Affinity and Cigna acquisitions are closed and synergized, we expect to achieve additional adjusted earnings per share of at least $2.
