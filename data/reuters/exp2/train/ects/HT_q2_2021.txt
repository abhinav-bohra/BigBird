We began the second quarter on strong footing as our portfolio RevPAR in April exceeded $100 and was 10% higher than March, which had been elevated due to spring break travel and stimulus spending.
Absolute RevPAR ticked sequentially higher during the balance of the second quarter, growing to $116 in May and exceeding $130 in June, resulting in second quarter RevPAR of $116, more than 50% higher than the first quarter 2021.
Last quarter, our comparable portfolio ADR grew from $193 in April to $220 in June.
That's just 13% below June 2019 without the core business traveler in the marketplace.

Our drive-to resorts also continued their recent outperformance during the second quarter as the group generated weighted average occupancy of 72% and ADR growth of 23%, leading to weighted average RevPAR growth of 17% compared to the second quarter of 2019, further proving that the leisure traveler is not price sensitive for high-quality, well-located, differentiated hotels.

The Ritz-Carlton Georgetown finished the quarter with nearly 72% occupancy at a $456 ADR. The Rittenhouse Hotel in Philadelphia also turned cash flow positive this quarter as ADR reached $478 with occupancy growing by more than 2,500 basis points versus the first quarter.
RevPAR and occupancy were up meaningfully from the first quarter, but RevPAR was still down approximately 45% from the second quarter of 2019.
The strong demand at our leisure-oriented properties and weekend demand at our urban hotels allowed us to maintain our average daily rates, less than 18% below 2019, all without any meaningful business travel or group demand in the marketplace.

Results from June cemented these projections as our comparable portfolio generated 59% occupancy with a 40% RevPAR decline.
And combined with our $7.7 million in property level earnings, resulted in $334,000 of positive corporate cash flow.

This provides us confidence in our ability to forecast post-pandemic EBITDA margin growth as our ability to drive ADR in tandem with applied expense savings initiatives should allow us to generate 150 to 250 basis points of sustainable long-term margin savings for the portfolio.
