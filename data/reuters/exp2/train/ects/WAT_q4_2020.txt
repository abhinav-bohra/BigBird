Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation.
In the 4th quarter, this resulted in $0.30 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
For the full year in 2020, free cash flow generation was $726 million after funding $172 million of capital expenditures.
This represents a 26% increase and $0.31 per dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.

In the 4th quarter, accounts receivables days sales outstanding came in at 70 days, down seven days compared to the 4th quarter of last year.

We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $443 million and debt of 1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter.
This resulted in a net debt position of $913 million and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.1 times at the end of the 4th quarter.
As of today, we have 1.5 billion remains available credit program for share repurchases.
We had a 1% tailwind from COVID-related revenue in 2000, three-quarters of which was in the second half of the year.
We expect a similar revenue impact in 2021, including a 1% to 2% growth tailwind in Q1.
These dynamics support full-year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8%.
At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 57, 5% to 58.9%.
Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29% based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of COVID-related cost actions, and disciplined expense controls.
Moving now below the operating income line, other key assumptions for full-year guidance are net interest expense of 35 million to 38 million, a full year tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which includes our new five-year tax agreement with Singapore that will expire in March 2026, a restart of our share repurchase program in 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61 to 61.5 million shares outstanding.
Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $9.32 to $9.57, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings-per-share growth of approximately 3 percentage points.
Looking at the first quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 10%.
At today's rate, currency translation is expected to increase first quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points.
First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60.
At current rates, the positive currency impact on first quarter earnings-per-share growth is expected to be approximately 15 percentage points.
