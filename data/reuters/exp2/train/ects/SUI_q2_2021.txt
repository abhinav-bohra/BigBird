In the second quarter, we delivered 61% growth in core FFO per share to $1.80 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 exceeding the high end of our guidance of $1.63 as our ongoing momentum accelerated beyond our forecasted expectations.
Comparing to a non-COVID impact quarter our second quarter FFO per share was 53% greater than the second quarter of 2019.
This outperformance, along with a positive outlook for the third and fourth quarters once again led us to raise our core 2021 FFO guidance range by $0.31 at the midpoint to $6.25 to $6.37 per share.

Same community manufactured housing NOI increased by 5.4% from 2020 and same community RV NOI increased by 85.1%.

Approximately $0.17 of the increase is due to our outperformance in the second quarter with the remainder due to contributions from our recent acquisitions and increased expectations across each of our businesses, particularly transient RV.
This is offset by approximately $8 million of property level proactive wage increases for the remainder of the year, which Gary previously discussed, of which approximately half had been included in prior issued guidance.
