We also previously estimated that operating expenses for the legacy Callaway business would be approximately $78 million higher than in 2019 due to the negative impact of foreign currency inflationary pressures and continued investment in the company's business, which included investment needed to assume the apparel business, investment in the other soft goods businesses and investment in Pro Tour.
