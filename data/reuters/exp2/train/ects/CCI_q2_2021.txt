We are experiencing the highest level of tower activity in our history, resulting in a year of outsized growth as we now anticipate 12% growth in AFFO per share for full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%.
Our current 7% to 8% growth target was established in 2017 when we expanded our fiber and small cell strategy through the completion of our largest acquisition.
This 7% to 8% growth target was an increase of 100 basis points from our prior target since we expected a diverse portfolio to increase our ability to consistently drive long-term growth.
Since that time, the strategy has worked better than expected as we have grown our dividend per share at a compounded annual growth rate of 9%, with some years being driven by outsized growth in our fiber and small cell business like last year, and other years like this one being driven by higher growth in our tower business.
While driving strong growth in our tower business this year, the initial focus by our customers on towers has also led to some delays in our small cell deployment, shifting the timing of when we expect to complete the nearly 30,000 small cells contractually committed in our backlog.
When combined with zoning and permitting challenges as well as the previously disclosed Sprint cancellation, we now expect to deploy approximately 5,000 small cells in each of this year and next year with the remaining nearly $20,000 from our current backlog completed beyond 2022.
With more than 50,000 small cells on air, we have already seen how important small cells are as a key tool used by the carriers to add network capacity by reusing their spectrum over shorter and shorter distances.
With that view in mind, we've invested nearly $40 billion in shared infrastructure assets that we believe are mission-critical for today's wireless networks and sit in front of what is expected to be a massive decade-long investment by our customers to deploy 5G in the U.S. As you can see on slide four, our tower and fiber investments are at two different stages of development and maturity.
Our tower investment began more than 20 years ago at an approximately 3% yield, when we built and acquired assets that we could share across multiple customers.
As we have proven out the value proposition for our customers over time, our tower assets now generate a yield on invested capital of 11% with meaningful capacity to support additional growth.
As we realize the wireless network architecture would need to evolve with 4G, requiring a network of cell sites that would be much denser and closer to end users, we expanded our shared infrastructure offering beyond towers, establishing the industry-leading small cell business in the U.S. It's encouraging that the business is already generating a current yield on invested capital of more than 7%, given the relative immaturity of these investments.
Looking at a collective view of how these five markets have performed over the last year on slide five, growth from both small cells and fiber solutions has contributed to an incremental yield of 7% on the approximately $200 million of incremental net capital investment.
Adjusted for the timing impacts associated with the large in-process small cell project, where capital investment has occurred in advance of the corresponding revenue and cash flows, the incremental yield is approximately 8%.
This incremental yield resulted in a modest decline in the combined cash yield from 9.2% a year ago to 9% currently.
This is in line with our expectations as we have invested in new small cells at a 6% to 7% initial yield that we expect to grow over time as we lease up those assets to additional customers.
During the last year in these markets, we have added more than 500 route miles of new high-capacity fiber to support the deployment of approximately 2,000 small cells.
Importantly, approximately 40% of the small cells deployed were co-located on existing fiber with the balance representing new anchor builds in attractive areas of these markets where we expect to capture future small cell and fiber solutions demand.
This is true because we have more time to add customers to existing assets, which is consistent with our historical experience with towers, where we have, on average, added about one tenant -- one new tenant every 10 years.
Importantly, during the last 12 months, we achieved strong yields on incremental invested capital in Denver, increasing the market yield by 70 basis points.
The best example to point to here is Philadelphia, where despite having a less mature capital base and lower node density than Phoenix, it is generating a similar yield on invested capital of nearly 10% due primarily to the higher contribution from fiber solutions.
Over the last year, the market yield in Philadelphia has contracted by 60 basis points due to a combination of a lack of small cell activity as this was not a priority market for our customers and more muted growth from fiber solutions.
As has been obvious to all of us over the last 18 months, connectivity is vital to our economy and how we live and interact with one another.
Importantly, none of this is possible without a team at Crown Castle that embraces diversity and inclusion, ensuring that our employees and our business partners are empowered to help us serve our customers, connect our communities and build the future of communications infrastructure in the U.S. So to wrap up, we expect to deliver outsized AFFO per share growth of 12% this year as we capitalize on the highest tower activity levels in our history with our customers deploying 5G at scale.
Our diversified strategy of towers and small cells has driven higher growth than expected as we have grown our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 9% since we expanded our strategy in 2017.
And looking forward, I believe our strategy to offer a combination of towers, small cells and fiber solutions, which are all critical components needed to develop 5G will extend our opportunity to deliver dividend per share growth of 7% to 8% per year.
The elevated tower activity drove strong second quarter financial results and another increase to our full year outlook, which now includes an expected 12% growth in AFFO per share.
Site rental revenue increased 8%, including 5.3% growth in organic contribution to site rental revenue.
This growth included 8.6% growth from new leasing activity and contracted escalators net of 3.3% from nonrenewal.
The higher activity levels also drove a $40 million increase in contribution from services when compared to second quarter 2020, leading to 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 18% growth in AFFO per share.
With the strong second quarter and continued momentum, we have again increased our full year outlook, highlighted by a $30 million increase to adjusted EBITDA and a $20 million increase to AFFO.
The higher activity in towers drove the majority of these changes to our outlook including an additional $15 million in straight-line revenue, a $45 million increase to the expected contribution from services and $15 million of additional labor costs.
The lower expected volume of small cells deployed this year that Jay discussed earlier results in a $10 million reduction in organic contribution to site rental revenue, which translates to a 20 basis point reduction in the expected full year growth in consolidated organic contribution to site rental revenue to 5.7%.
Our expectations for the contribution to full year growth from towers and fiber solutions remains unchanged at approximately 6% for towers and 3% for fiber solutions, with small cell growth now expected to be approximately 10% compared to our previous outlook of approximately 13% growth.
During the second quarter, capital expenditures totaled $308 million, including $19 million of sustaining expenditures, $60 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our tower segment and $223 million of discretionary capital expenditures for our fiber segment.
Our full year expectation for capital expenditures has reduced to $1.3 billion from our prior expectation of $1.5 billion, primarily attributed to the reduction in small cells we expect to deploy this year.
Specifically, since our first investment-grade bond offering in early 2016, we have increased the weighted average maturity from just over five years to nearly 10 years, increased our mix of fixed rate debt from just under 70% to more than 90% and reduced our weighted average borrowing rate from 3.8% to 3.2%.
Consistent with that focus, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in June at 2.5% to refinance outstanding notes maturing in 2022 and to repay outstanding borrowings on our commercial paper program.
We are capitalizing on those positive fundamentals and expect to deliver a great year of growth with AFFO now expected to grow 12% for the full year 2021, meaningfully above our long-term annual target of 7% to 8%.
Our diverse portfolio of assets and customer solutions has performed better than expected since we meaningfully augmented our fiber footprint with a large acquisition in 2017 as we have grown our dividend per share at a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that time.
We continue to invest in new assets that we believe will allow us to grow our dividend per share at 7% to 8% per year going forward.
This growth provides a very attractive total return opportunity when combined with our current approximately 3% dividend yield, and we believe our investments in new assets will extend this opportunity into the future.
