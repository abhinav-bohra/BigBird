Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.
Revenue is up $640 million or 7.3% against the first quarter last year.
Operating earnings are up $4 million, and net earnings are up $2 million.
To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million, and aerospace is up $196 million.
The operating earnings on the defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus.
The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter.
This was driven by a 250-basis-point lower margin rate at aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense.
From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.18 per share.
We have roughly $500 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $50 million more in operating earnings.
Aerospace enjoyed revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $220 million with an 11.7% operating margin.
Revenue is almost $200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side.
Revenue is also $196 million higher than the year-ago quarter.
The 11.7% operating margin is lower than the year-ago quarter, but consistent with our guidance and sell-side expectations.
Aerospace also had a very strong quarter from an orders perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1.
Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.34:1.
Gulfstream experienced a 5.7% increase in service revenue.
Jet Aviation service revenue is down around $31 million, coupled with a modest increase in service operating earnings.
As of the end of last week, we have delivered 104 of these aircraft to customers.
The G700 has over 1,400 test hours on the five test aircraft, and the first fully outfitted G700 is flying.
Combat systems has revenue of $1.8 billion, up 6.6% over the year-ago quarter.
It is also interesting to observe that combat systems revenue has grown in 16 of the last 18 quarters on a quarter over the year-ago quarter basis.
Operating earnings, at $244 million, are up 9.4% on higher volume and a 30-basis-point improvement in margin.
You may recall that at this time a year ago, I was able to report that revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter in 2019.
I am very pleased to report today that first-quarter 2021 revenue of $2.48 billion is up 10.6% against first-quarter 2020.
In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 14 quarters on a quarter versus the year-ago quarter basis.
Operating earnings are $200 million in the quarter, up $16 million or 8.7% on an operating margin of 8.1%.
On the order side, I should observe that total backlog was down only $231 million sequentially, leaving a powerful $49.8 billion in total backlog.
This segment have revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, up $95 million from the year-ago quarter or 3.1%.
IT alone grew 5% in the quarter.
Operating earnings at $306 million or up $8 million or 2.7% on a 9.6% operating margin.
This is about 40 basis points ahead of consensus.
EBITDA margin is an impressive 13.3%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50-basis-point drag on that result.
Total backlog grew $359 million sequentially, and total estimated contract value remained about the same.
On the bid and proposal front, GDIT submitted the highest dollar value of proposals in any quarter since the acquisition of CSRA, 90% of which represent new business opportunities.
They ended the quarter with over $30 billion in proposals awaiting customer decision, most of which also represent new business opportunities versus recompetition of existing work.
So good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon.
Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million.
So the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range.
Looking at capital deployment, I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $134 million in the quarter or 1.4% of sales.
That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full-year capex to be roughly 2.5% of sales.
We also paid $315 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share.
And we spent nearly $750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $161 per share.
After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from this time last year.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $123 million, up from $107 million in the first quarter of 2020.
We have $3 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we plan to refinance a portion of those notes to achieve a more balanced deployment of capital, but this will still result in a declining debt balance this year and beyond.
We expect the cash benefit from the act to increase modestly over the next couple of years, reinforcing our expectation that free cash flow can exceed 100% of net income over that period.
The tax rate in the quarter, at 16.2%, is consistent with our full-year expectation, so no change to our outlook on that front.
Finally, order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole, even as we grew by more than 7% in the quarter.
As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the aerospace and technologies groups led the way with a 1.3 times and 1.1 times book-to-bill, respectively.
We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $89.6 billion.
That's up 4.5% over this time last year.
And total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts, was $131.4 billion, up 6% over the year-ago quarter.
