We achieved a gross margin of 35.6% for the third quarter 30 basis points higher than Q2 and within our guidance range of 35% to 36% due primarily to a favorable product mix and reduced spending in all of our business segments to react to the softer market demand in Q3 and expected to continue through Q4.

Revenues from aerospace and defense programs were strong in Q3 growing 19% sequentially and are up 17% year-to-date compared to 2018.
ADAS revenues were down 7% sequentially from a strong second quarter but are up 8% year-to-date compared to 2018 in the face of a weak auto market.
The third quarter is typically the strongest quarter for portable electronics revenues which grew 5% sequentially and 10% compared to Q3 2018 due to our customers' commercialization of new handset and tablet designs.
General industrial application revenues which comprise close to 40% of the business segment's revenues were down slightly compared to the second quarter and down 5% compared to the third quarter 2018.
Revenues for these applications decreased sequentially by 20% and 13% respectively and decreased 27% and 26% respectively compared to Q3 2018.

Through September the company generated $115.7 million from operating activities net of an increase in working capital of $4 million primarily from the increase in inventory with long lead times.
Taking a look at our Q4 guidance on slide 16 we are facing near-term macroeconomic headwinds as well as softness in certain of our markets from ongoing trade tensions that we expect to continue through Q4.
Therefore revenues for Q4 are estimated to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million.
As a result we are guiding gross margin in the range of 33% to 34% for Q4.
The company will however take a $52 million to $56 million non-cash charge to income for other accumulated losses for the plan that were recorded as part of our equity.
As a result we guided GAAP Q4 loss in the range of $1.43 to $1.28 per share.
On an adjusted basis we guide the fully diluted earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.15 per share for the fourth quarter.
