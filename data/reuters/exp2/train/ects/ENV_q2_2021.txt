Before we discuss our results, I encourage you to review the cautionary statement on slides 2 and 3 for our customary disclosures.
Envestnet achieved strong adjusted revenue growth of 23% in the quarter and 70% year-to-date.
The number of advisors on the Envestnet platform is now almost 108,000 with 14 million accounts that make up $5.2 trillion in assets.
Our data aggregation business serves over 500 million aggregated accounts each day.
New accounts are being opened at a faster pace and we are averaging well more than 10,000 new accounts every week.
During the second quarter, we serviced almost 15 million trades and completed 1.8 million service requests.
We're also generating more than 8 million data driven recommendations a day for our clients to better connect and better serve all of their clients.
As we mentioned on Investor Day, we are on our way to 10 million recommendations a day by year-end and over a billion, a day by 2025.
As you overlay these trends across the current business that we serve today, which is $5.2 trillion in assets.
We believe we can increase our revenue by roughly 10 basis points on average on 10% to 15% of this asset base.
Our developer portal enables over 625, third party FinTechs to leverage APIs embedding our capabilities and data into their environments.
This usage has grown by 1700% since the beginning of January 2020.
Adjusted revenues for the second quarter grew 23% to $289 million compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted EBITDA grew 27% to $71 million compared to the second quarter of last year.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.67.
Turning to the balance sheet; we ended June with approximately $370 million in cash and debt of $860 million.
The debt consists of our outstanding convertible notes maturing in 2023 and 2025.
Our $500 million revolving credit facility was undrawn as of June 30, making our net leverage ratio at the end of June 1.8 times EBITDA.
We continue to expect the investments to account for roughly $30 million of operating expense during the year.
We expect the investments to ramp up throughout 2021 with most of the impact in the second half of the year and annualizing to a run rate of approximately $40 to $45 million in 2022, growing at the same rate of operating expenses thereafter.
Adjusted EBITDA to be between $61 million and $63 million as we further ramp up the investments and earnings per share to be $0.58 per share.
For the full year, we expect adjusted revenues to be between $1.169 million and $1.174 million, up 17% to 17.5% compared to 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA to be between $253 and $257 million, representing growth of 4% to 6% for the full year, and earnings per share to be between $2.30 and $2.35, which is $0.31 higher than the original guidance we gave back in February.
Second, our data and analytics segment has grown subscription revenue around 4% in the first-half of the year compared to the first-half of last year.
As we continue to execute on our strategy in the coming years and begin to benefit from the investments were making now, we will capture more of the opportunity we've identified positioning us to attain our longer-term targets of mid-teens growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin of 25% by 2025.
