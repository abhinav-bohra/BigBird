From our founding over 50 years ago, TDS believes that being a good corporate citizen is fundamental to our long-term success.
Before turning the call over, I want to remind everyone that due to the FCC's anti-collusion rules related to the ongoing Auction 110, we will not be responding to any questions related to spectrum auctions.
As you can see, we've raised $3.4 billion since the beginning of 2020 at an average cost of 4.9%, and redeemed six separate bond series comprising $1.6 billion in debt with a weighted average cost of 7%.

So far, we have about 1/4 of our smartphone subscribers with 5G-capable devices.
We're offering commercial millimeter wave fixed wireless access speeds of up to 300 megabits per second.
We recently received a Net Promoter Score of 40, which is an amazing loyalty score.

We saw connected device gross additions decline 26,000 year-over-year.
Total smartphone connections increased by 8,000 during the quarter and by 65,000 over the course of the past 12 months.
We saw prepaid gross additions improve by 9,000 year-over-year.
Next, let's turn to the postpaid churn rate shown on Slide 10.
Postpaid handset churn, depicted by the blue bars, was 0.95%, up from 0.88% a year ago.
Total postpaid churn, combining handsets and connected devices, was 1.15% for the third quarter of 2021, higher than a year ago as we've also seen churn increase on connected devices due to certain business and government customers disconnecting devices that were activated during the peak periods of the pandemic in 2020.
Now let's turn to the financial results on Slide 11.
Total operating revenues for the third quarter were $1.016 billion, a decrease of $11 million or 1% year-over-year.
Retail service revenues increased by $25 million to $699 million.
Inbound roaming revenue was $30 million.
That was a decrease of $12 million year-over-year, driven by a decrease in data volume and rates.
Other service revenues were $59 million, flat year-over-year.
Finally, equipment sales revenues decreased by $24 million year-over-year due to a decrease in average revenue per unit, in large part as a result of an increase in promotional activity as well as a decrease in overall sales volume.
As a result of the combined impact of these factors, loss on equipment increased $19 million year-over-year from $5 million in 2020 to $24 million in 2021.
Now a few more comments about postpaid revenue shown on Slide 12.
Average revenue per user or connection was $48.12 for the third quarter, up $1.02 or approximately 2% year-over-year.
On a per account basis, average revenue grew by $2.72 or 2% year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 13.
Third quarter tower rental revenues increased by 6% year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 14.
As shown at the bottom of the slide, adjusted operating income was $213 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year.
As I commented earlier, total operating revenues were $1.016 billion, a 1% decrease year-over-year.
Total cash expenses were $803 million, an increase of $8 million or 1% year-over-year.
Total system operations expense increased 1% year-over-year.
Excluding roaming expense, system operations expense increased by 7% due to higher circuit costs, cell site rent and maintenance expense.
Roaming expense decreased $8 million or 17% year-over-year, driven by lower data rates and lower voice usage.
Cost of equipment sold decreased $5 million or 2% year-over-year due to a significant decline in connected device sales, partially offset by a slightly higher average cost per unit sold as a result of the mix shifting more heavily toward smartphone sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11 million or 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in bad debts expense and costs associated with supporting enterprise projects and billing system upgrades.
Turning to Slide 15.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $262 million, a decrease of $20 million or 7% year-over-year.
First, we have narrowed our guidance for service revenues to a range of $3.075 billion to $3.125 billion, maintaining the midpoint.
For adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA, we are maintaining our guidance ranges of $850 million to $950 million and $1.025 billion to $1.125 billion, respectively.
For capital expenditures, we are decreasing our guidance range to $700 million to $800 million as we are moving certain equipment and project spend into 2022.
TDS Telecom grew its footprint 6% from a year ago, now serving 1.4 million service addresses across its markets.
Also in the quarter, we completed fiber-to-the-home construction in our Southern Wisconsin cluster, where we are seeing total broadband penetration of 38% in this fully launched cluster.
In total, during the quarter, we added 20,000 fiber service addresses, surpassing 40% of our wireline service addresses, a key milestone for us.
From a financial perspective, overall, we grew our top line 2%, while planned investment spending on new market launches resulted in lower adjusted EBITDA as expected.
Turning to Slide 18.
Moving to Slide 19.
Total residential connections increased 3% due to broadband growth in new and existing markets, partially offset by a decrease in voice connections.
Total telecom broadband residential connections grew 7% in the quarter as we continue to fortify our network with fiber and expand into new markets.
Overall, higher value product mix and price increases drove a 4% increase in average residential revenue per connection.
On Slide 20, you can see the broadband connection growth across all markets.
Our focus on fast, reliable service has generated a 13% increase in total residential broadband revenue.
We are offering one gig broadband speeds to 57% of our total footprint, including both our fiber and DOCSIS 3.1 markets.
In areas where we offer one gig service, we are now seeing 20% of our new customers taking this superior product.
Turning to Slide 21.
A majority of TDS Telecom's residential customers take advantage of bundling options, as 63% of customers subscribe to more than one service, which helps to keep our churn low.
Wireline growth of 6%, driven by our expansion markets, nearly offset losses in the cable market.
For example, we are experiencing a 38% video attachment rate to every broadband connection in our wireline markets where we offer IPTV services.
The rollout of this product currently covers 61% of our total operations, including cable.
Moving to Slide 22.
As a result of this strategy, 40% of our wireline service addresses are now served by fiber, which is up from 34% a year ago.
This is driving revenue growth while also expanding the total wireline footprint 8% to 891,000 service addresses.
On Slide 24, we highlighted the total service addresses for the cluster, the clusters that are in construction and we are actively marketing.
In total, these communities add more than 270,000 additional service addresses to our existing fiber deployment plan.
Through the third quarter, we have 358,000 total fiber service addresses and are working to build out the footprint in these announced markets, growing to 929,000 service addresses over the next several years.
Year-to-date, we completed construction of 51,000 fiber addresses, adding 20,000 service addresses in the quarter.
For example, in Meridian, Idaho, we experienced a temporary delay on more than 35,000 service addresses and just recently have restarted construction.
On Slide 25, total revenues increased 2% year-over-year to $252 million, driven by the strong growth in residential revenues, which increased 6% in total.
Incumbent wireline markets also showed solid residential growth of 3% due to increases in broadband connections as well as increases from within the broadband product mix, partially offset by a 4% decrease in residential voice connections.
Cable residential revenues grew 6%, also due to increases in broadband connections as well as the product mix.
Commercial revenues decreased 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by lower CLEC connections, partially offset by a 5% increase in broadband connections.
Wholesale revenue decreased 5% due to certain state USF support timing.
So let me sum up the combined financial results for the quarter as shown on Slide 26.
Total revenues increased 2% from the prior year as growth from our fiber expansions and increases in broadband subscribers exceeded the declines we experienced in our legacy business.
Cash expenses increased 3% due to both supporting our current growth as well as spending related to future expansion into new markets, which is not yet reflected in our revenues.
As a result, adjusted EBITDA decreased 2% to $77 million, as expected.
Capital expenditures were down 1% to $91 million as increased investment in fiber deployments were offset by decreased spend on core operations.
And on Slide 27, we provided our updated 2021 guidance.
We expect revenues to be between $990 million and $1.02 billion, and adjusted EBITDA to be between $295 million and $315 million.
With the construction delays and build challenges I mentioned earlier, we are lowering our expectations for capital expenditures to be between $400 million and $450 million.
