For a description of these risks and uncertainties, please see H&R Block's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as updated periodically with the company's other SEC filings.
Then I'll share perspective on the value we have created over the last several years and the levers we have to achieve our long-term revenue growth target of 3% to 6%.
On the capital allocation front, which we'll dig into in a minute, we reduced shares outstanding by another 4% this quarter.
Since 2016, we've averaged annual free cash flow of $465 million, an increase of 29%.
Including the most recent quarter, we've grown the dividend by 35% and repurchased nearly 1/4 of shares outstanding.
In total, these actions have led to an adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 78%.
We have had our foot on the gas since announcing Block Horizons at our Investor Day last December where we shared our long-term revenue growth target of 3% to 6%.
The tax industry has grown consistently for a long period of time, averaging a historical CAGR of 1%.
We anticipate that holding share at a minimum will add about 1 point of growth annually to our top line.
In DIY, we have a 10% to 20% price advantage relative to our largest competitor.
Over the past five years, we have purchased on average 125 locations annually, typically from franchisees who are ready to exit for family or retirement reasons.
We believe we can acquire a similar number each year through 2025, which will contribute nearly 1 point of growth to our top line.
Wave's total revenue continues to grow more than 30% year-over-year.
This is contributing about 1 point of growth annually to our consolidated top line.
We know there are 35 million underbanked consumers in the United States alone, a group we view as financially vulnerable and financially coping.
Of this population, 8 million are current Block customers.
In summary, with respect to revenue growth, we have many levers working in tandem to reach our annual 3% to 6% growth target.
I am more confident now than ever in our plans for Block Horizons 2025.
We delivered $193 million of revenue, down 54% or $225 million.
This decline was entirely due to the estimated $246 million related to the tax season extension in the first quarter of last year.
Total operating expenses in the quarter were $367 million, a decrease of 12%, primarily driven by lower tax pro compensation as a result of the prior year extension I just discussed.
Interest expense was $23 million, a decrease of 34% due to lower draws on our line of credit.
For the quarter, our pre-tax loss was $197 million, compared to $33 million in the prior year.
Our effective tax rate was 24%.
We continue to expect the tax rate to be in the 16% to 18% range for the full fiscal year as we realize the benefits of certain discrete items later in fiscal '22.
Turning to share repurchases, we bought a total of $166 million in the quarter, allowing us to retire 6.8 million shares at an average price of $24.37.
Since taking over this post in 2016, we have now retired nearly 1/4 of our shares outstanding and have approximately $400 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Loss per share from continuing operations increased from $0.32 to $0.84, while adjusted loss per share from continuing operations increased from $0.24 to $0.78.
Over the past five years, we've returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders or approximately 84% of our total free cash flow.
These achievements have translated into adjusted earnings per share growth of 78%, and that's even after normalizing fiscal year '21 for the tax season extension.
