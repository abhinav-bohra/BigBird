For a discussion of these factors, we refer you specifically to our annual report on Form 10-k for the fiscal year ended December 31 2019; our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2020; our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2020 which we anticipate being filed later today; and our other filings with the SEC which are available at the SEC's internet site www.
OSG's vessels were employed at healthy charter rates for close to 95% of available days for the first half of 2020.
We are also permanently removing the OSG 244 from service through a sale for scrap, an action that was due to be taken in any case by the end of this month.
In August, the OSG 350 Vision will move back into the lightering service following completion of a required dry dock and special survey replacing the OSG 351 Horizon in this service.
This will allow the OSG 351 Horizon to complete her planned dry docking special survey work that's anticipated to be completed before the end of September.
As we move into the final quarter of this year, the OSG 350 Vision will again be redeployed as a conventional ATB available in the spot market.
The combination of these activities will result in reduced revenue days during July and August with an expected reduction in time charter equivalent revenues for the third quarter of approximately 15% when compared to the second quarter.
The Energy Information Agency reports, the refinery runs in the U.S. in recent weeks have recovered to close to 80% of capacity.
Over the past four weeks, motor gasoline consumption has averaged 8.7 million barrels per day up from an April low of five million barrels per day and now roughly 9% below comparable year-ago levels -- consumption figures are also running at just less than 10% below year-ago averages.
Jet fuel consumption remains 40% below year-ago levels as passenger flights in the U.S. continue to operate at roughly one-third of year-ago capacity.
TSA passenger figures at U.S. airports have come off their lows but have been flattening out at about 25% of year-ago comparables over the past six weeks.
Marathon Oil has also just announced that it will not restart its Martinez refinery, a 160,000 barrel per day unit in the San Francisco Bay.
This transaction includes a commitment by Marathon to supply gasoline to the buyer for over the next 15 years.
two shuttle tankers, 10 MR tankers and two non-Jones Act MR tankers that participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program.
We took delivery of the OSG 204 ATB at the end of May and drew the remaining $5 million availability on the loan at that time.
The total loan balance is now $32.9 million at a fixed 5% interest rate.
TCE revenues grew 22.3% or $18.3 million from the year-ago quarter.
Sequentially, TCE revenues increased $3.3 million or 3.4%.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 63.7% or $11.6 million compared to the second quarter of 2019.
As a reminder, the second quarter of 2019 included a $4.3 million write-off of our PES receivables.
Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA likewise included a onetime gain of $19.2 million on the termination of prior arrangements related to our acquisition of the Alaska Tanker Company.
We operated 24 vessels for the full second quarter of 2020 and 2021 in the second quarter of 2019.
The related tug will go through drydock before relocating to Oregon to be paired with the OSG 205.
We have 56 off-hire days due to drydock activities during the quarter.
The Alaskan tanker acquisitions contributed $15.9 million in revenue during their first full quarter of operations.
Revenues from our Jones Act handysize tankers increased $8.8 million from the year-ago quarter.
Effective daily rate for fixed earnings increased over $4,000 per day while the number of days increased by 129.
ATB TCE revenues decreased by $5.1 million from 2019 second quarter, driven by the reduction in our rebuilt operating ATBs to 1.
We added the OSG 204 during June and she contributed $1.3 million in revenue.
Total revenue days declined from 341 during last year's quarter to 124 in this year's quarter.
TCE revenues from our four non-Jones Act tankers increased $4.6 million from last year's quarter.
The Gulf Coast and Sun Coast, both of which are on long-term time charters contributed $3 million.
Lightering revenues decreased $6.2 million from the second quarter of 2019.
Subsequently the PES refinery ceased operations and the OSG 350 was repositioned to the Gulf of Mexico.
During the second quarter of 2020, the OSG 350 was in dry dock and therefore off-hire for approximately one month.
The OSG 351 lightered fewer barrels during the quarter due to reduced demand from our customers as refinery utilization decreased.
Sequentially the $3.3 million increase in TCE revenues were driven by the Alaskan Tanker acquisition.
Offsetting this was the $2.8 million decrease in ATB revenues and a $7 million decrease in lightering revenues both for the reasons previously stated.
Turning to slide 11.
The OSG 350 has now returned to the Delaware Bay to replace the OSG 351 Horizon as she undergoes her dry dock during the third quarter.
Vessel operating contribution, which we define as TCE revenues, less vessel operating expenses and charter hire expenses, increased $9.3 million or 34% from Q2 2019 to $36.3 million in the current quarter.
The largest contributor to the increase was the $8.5 million addition to vessel operating contribution from our Alaskan tankers.
The Jones Act tankers added $7.2 million.
Offsetting these increases were reduced contributions from our ATBs of $3.4 million and niche market activities of $3 million.
The introduction of the OSG 204 in June and the OSG 205 later this year will reverse this trend.
Niche market activities declined due to increased dry dock related off-hire days for our MSP vessels and the OSG 350 Vision as well as reduced Delaware Bay lightering demand.
Sequentially, vessel operating contribution decreased $2.5 million from the first quarter.
This was partially offset by a $6.6 million increase in contribution from the Alaskan tankers due to their inclusion for the full quarter as opposed to 19 days in the first quarter.
Second quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $29.8 million compared to first quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $52.8 million.
Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased $11.6 million from $18.2 million in Q2 2019.
Net income for the second quarter was $6.4 million compared to the net loss of $1.7 million recorded in the second quarter of 2019.
Vessel maintenance requirements are based on the original construction date at intervals of approximately 2.5 years.
We estimate, which includes the three recently acquired Alaskan tankers that our investment will be $45.9 million in dry dock expenses and $17 million for ballast water treatment systems in 2020.
We will experience approximately $20 million in lost revenue for the full year, resulting from 401 off-hire days.
Our estimate is that we will experience 275 off-hire days in the third and fourth quarters of 2020.
The related revenue loss is expected to exceed $14 million.
The OSG 205 is expected to deliver in late November this year.
We have invested through the end of the second quarter $36.5 million in the OSG 205.
Our remaining payments including amounts which will be due on delivery of $14.5 million.
We are currently engaged in discussions to obtain financing for the 205.
In 2020, if we were to achieve an average TCE rate of $62,000 across the 10 AMSC vessels there would be no profit sharing.
The minimum average rate required to result in profit sharing obligation in 2020 is $69,000 and this would create an aggregate payout of $300,000.
Given the assumptions used, the profit sharing payout would be $8 million.
The minimum average rate necessary to achieve any level of profit share in 2022 would be $62,000.
Again, using the assumptions here the profit share earned in 2023 would be $14 million.
At the beginning of the second quarter, we had total cash of $102 million which included $20.1 million of restricted cash.
During the second quarter of 2020, we generated $30 million of adjusted EBITDA.
We drew the remaining $5 million available on the OSG 204 loan upon delivery of the vessel.
We expended $7 million on dry docking and improvements to our vessels.
And we invested $18 million in new vessel construction and other CapEx.
We incurred $6 million in interest expense and made debt repayments of $9 million.
The result was we ended the quarter with $95 million in cash including $20.1 million of restricted cash.
Continuing our discussion of cash and liquidity as we mentioned on the previous slide, we had $95 million of cash at June 30, 2020 including $20.1 million of restricted cash.
Our total debt was down to $446 million which represents a net decrease of $4 million in outstanding indebtedness since March 2020.
Our $325 million term loan has an annual amortization requirement of $25 million or $6.25 million per quarter.
With $374 million of equity our net debt-to-equity ratio is 0.9x.
After the end of the second quarter, we fully repaid a $24 million loan secured by one of our two tankers delivered in October 2019.
We funded part of the payoff with $20 million of restricted cash.
This will ultimately result in a reduction of annual debt service of $2.6 million and our total debt is now $422 million.
Another domestic yard Marinette Marine Corporation was recently awarded a contract to design and produce the next generation of up to 10 guided missile frigates.
But in aggregate, the net reduction will be between, 250,000 and 500,000 barrels per day nationally or less than 5% of total fuel demand.
More than 80% of vessel available days for the balance of the year are covered, either through time charter contracts or contracts of affreightment.
We anticipate a stronger performance in the fourth quarter, which should put us squarely on track to be within the range of $380 million to $400 million of time charter equivalent earnings for the full year.
Similarly, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2020 to reach between $40 million and $45 million, a result which would bring full year adjusted EBITDA to a figure likely to exceed $120 million.
