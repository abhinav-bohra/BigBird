First, we recorded a GAAP only after tax charge of $472 million related to our agreement to sell certain European businesses to the Phoenix Group to account for the remeasurement of the net assets to lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell.

Moving now to our second quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides eight through 13, and I'll start with US Pharmaceutical.
Revenues were $53.4 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year as increased pharmaceutical volumes, including growth in specialty products and our largest retail national account customers were partially offset by branded to generic conversions.
Adjusted operating profit increased 12% to $735 million, driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution.
The contribution from our contract with the US government-related to the distribution of COVID-19 provided a benefit of approximately $0.28 per share in the quarter, which is above our original expectations.
In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment revenues were $932 million, an increase of 40% driven by higher biopharma service offerings, including third-party logistics services and increased technology service revenue, partially resulting from the growth of prescription volumes.
Adjusted operating profit increased 38% to $144 million, driven by organic growth from access and adherence solutions.
Moving now to Medical-Surgical Solutions, revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 23%, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 tests and growth in the primary care business.
Adjusted operating profit increased 52% to $319 million, driven by growth in the primary care business, increased sales of COVID-19 tests, and the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the US governments COVID-19 vaccine program.
The contribution from our contract with US government-related to the kitting, distribution and storage of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines provided a benefit of approximately $0.14 per share in the quarter, which was above our original expectations.
Revenues in the quarter were $9.1 billion, a decrease of 5%, primarily driven by the contribution of McKesson's German wholesale business to a joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance, partially offset by volume increases in the pharmaceutical distribution and retail businesses.
Segment revenue increased 13% year-over-year and was up 9% on an FX adjusted basis.
Adjusted operating profit increased 41% year-over-year to $163 million.
On an FX adjusted basis adjusted operating profit increased 34% to $155 million, driven by the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization on certain European assets classified as held for sale beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
The held for sale accounting in our international business contributed $0.13 to adjusted earnings in our second quarter of fiscal 2022.
Adjusted corporate expenses were $83 million, a decrease of 39% year-over-year, driven by gains of approximately $97 million or $0.46 from equity investments within our McKesson Ventures portfolio.
This quarter we had fair value adjustments related to multiple portfolio companies within McKesson Ventures, compared to fiscal 2021 gains from McKesson Ventures contributed $0.24 year-over-year.
We also reported opioid related litigation expenses of $36 million for the second quarter and anticipate that fiscal 2022 opioid-related litigation expenses will be approximately $155 million.
Consistent with the proposed settlement announced in July, we also made the first annual payment into escrow of approximately $354 million during the quarter.
Let me now turn to our cash position, which can be found on Slide 14.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion for the first six months of the fiscal year, we had negative free cash flow of $109 million.
In August, we completed a cash funded upsize tender offer, which resulted in the redemption of $922 million principal outstanding debt.
And finally, we completed a public offering of a note in the principal amount of $500 million at 1.3%.
Year-to-date, we made $279 million of capital expenditures, which included investments to support our strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services.
For the first six months of the fiscal year, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to our shareholders through $1.3 billion of share repurchases and the payment of $134 million in dividends.
We have $1.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization and continue to expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to range from 154 million to 156 million for fiscal 2022.
As a result of our strong first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range for fiscal 2022 to $21.95 to $22.55, which is up from our previous range of $19.80 to $20.40.
Our updated outlook for adjusted earnings per diluted share reflects 27.5% to 31% growth from the prior year.
Additionally, fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance includes $2.30 to $3.05 of impacts attributable to the following items: $0.50 to $0.70 related to the US governments COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which is an increase from the previous range of $0.45 to $0.55; $0.80 to $1.10 related to the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies, an increase from the previous range of $0.50 to $0.70 as discussed at recent conference; $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests impairments for PPE related products; and approximately $0.49 from gains or losses associated with McKesson Ventures equity investments within our corporate segment year-to-date.
Excluding the impact of these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results this indicates 20% to 29% forecasted growth.
In US Pharmaceutical segment, we now expect revenue to increase 8% to 11% and adjusted operating profit to deliver 4.5% to 7.5% growth over the prior year.
When excluding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the segment, we expect approximately 3% to 6% adjusted operating profit growth.
In addition, our investments in our leading and differentiated position in oncology will continue to represent an approximate $0.20 headwind in fiscal 2022.
In our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we see revenue growth of 31% to 37%, and adjusted operating profit growth of 23% to 29%, this growth reflects the strong service and transaction momentum in the business.
Now transitioning to Medical-Surgical our revenue outlook assumes a 8% to 14% growth and adjusted operating profit to deliver 35% to 45% growth over the prior year.
As mentioned previously, our outlook includes $0.80 to $1.10 related to the contribution from the US government's distribution of ancillary supply kits and storage programs, and $0.50 to $0.75 related to COVID-19 tests and PPE impairments related products.
Excluding the impacts from these items from both fiscal 2022 guidance and fiscal 2021 results, this indicates 13% to 19% forecasted growth.
Therefore, the guidance that we're providing today includes approximately $0.10 to $0.20 of adjusted operating expense impact for labor investments in our US distribution businesses in the second half of the year.
Finally in the international segment, our revenue guidance is 1% decline to 4% growth as compared to the prior year.
For adjusted operating profit our guidance reflects growth in the segment of 39% to 43%, which includes approximately $0.38 of expected adjusted earnings accretion in fiscal 2022, as a result of the held for sale accounting related to our agreement to sell certain European assets to the Phoenix Group.
Our increased guidance assumes a 8% to 11% revenue growth and 18% to 22% adjusted operating profit growth, compared to fiscal 2021.
Our full-year adjusted effective tax rate guidance of 18% to 19% remains unchanged.
And we anticipate corporate expenses in the range of $610 million, $660 million.
And based on this progress we now expect earlier benefits from these actions, resulting in the realization of annual operating expense savings of approximately $15 million to $25 million in the second half of fiscal 2022, with annual savings of $50 million to $70 million, when fully implemented.
