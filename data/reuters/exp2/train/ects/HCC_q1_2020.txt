Excluding nonrecurring, other income and losses, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the first quarter was $20 million or $0.39 per diluted share compared to $2.30 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA was $62 million in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $181 million in the same period of 2019.
The quarterly decrease was primarily driven by a 31% decrease in average net selling prices and a 13% decrease in sales volumes.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 27% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 48% in the first quarter of 2019.
Total revenues were approximately $227 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $378 million in the same period last year.

Cash cost of sales per short ton, FOB port, was approximately $83 in the first quarter compared to $87 in the same period of 2019.
The decrease is primarily due to lower price-sensitive costs such as transportation and royalties that vary with met coal pricing, offset partially by 13% lower sales volumes.
SG&A expenses were about $8 million or 4% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2020 compared to approximately $9 million in the prior year period, primarily due to lower corporate expenses.
Depreciation and depletion expenses for the first quarter of 2020 were $29 million compared to $22 million in 2019.
Net interest expense was about $8 million in the first quarter and included interest on our outstanding debt plus amortization of our debt issuance costs associated with our credit facilities, partially offset by interest income.
This amount was $1 million lower compared to the same period last year primarily due to the early retirement of a portion of our debt in last year's first quarter.
We recorded noncash income tax expense of $3 million during the first quarter of 2020 and $28 million in the same period last year.
We continue to expect the utilization of our NOLs will reduce our federal and state income tax liability to 0 until the NOLs are fully utilized or expired.
During the first quarter of 2020, we used $5 million of free cash flow, which was the result of cash flows provided by operating activities of $21 million, less cash used for capital expenditures and mine development costs of $26 million.
Operating cash flows were significantly lower in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average net selling prices of 31% and lower sales volumes of 13%.
Cash used in investing activities primarily for capital expenditures and mine development costs was $20 million during the first quarter of 2020 compared to $30 million for the same period last year.
Cash flows provided by financing activities were $63 million in the first quarter of 2020 and consisted primarily of the draw on our ABL facility of $70 million as a precautionary measure, less payments for capital leases of $4 million and less payment of the quarterly dividend of $3 million.
Of note, our balance sheet remains strong with a leverage ratio of 0.52x adjusted EBITDA.
Our total available liquidity at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was $303 million, consisting of cash, cash equivalents of $257 million and $46 million available under our ABL facility, net of borrowings of $70 million and outstanding letters of credit of approximately $9 million.
As I mentioned earlier, we drew $70 million on our ABL facility as a precautionary measure to increase liquidity and reduce risk during these unprecedented times.
For example, as precautionary measures, we have delayed the $25 million budgeted for the development of the Blue Creek project until at least July 1, 2020, and have temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program.
