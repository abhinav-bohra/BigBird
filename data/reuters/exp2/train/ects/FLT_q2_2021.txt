We reported Q2 revenue of $667 million that's up 27% and cash earnings per share of $3.15, up 38%.
Organic revenue growth came in at 23% for the quarter, our full AP outsourcing platform segment, up 53% versus Q2 last year.
Our same-store sales metric improved to plus 18%, so hardness of 18%, many of the sectors in our client base recovering.
Retention, record level, we reached nearly 94%, an all-time high since we've been reporting the metric.
And interestingly, our global fuel card business reached 92% retention, also an all-time high.
Credit losses remain very good, running at historic levels and sales outstanding in the quarter finishing up almost two times last year's Q2 and up 6% against 2019.
So, today, we're raising guidance to $2.765 billion at the midpoint for full year revenue, raising cash earnings per share at the midpoint to $12.90.
As a reminder, cash earnings per share guidance up nearly $0.60 from the start of the year.
So, we opened the year at $12.30; today, $12.90, so obviously, better than we outlooked.
So, first, the revenue growth will run about 20% ahead of last year and high single-digits really above the second half 2019 baseline.
Our Q4 earnings per share profit guidance implies nearly a $14 annualized cash earnings per share exit rate.
We've already exited about $10 million of run rate payroll expense.
We're expecting the businesses to grow about 20% on the top on a pro forma basis next year and together deliver incremental cash earnings per share in 2022 in the $0.50 to $0.70 range, so big upside.
You'll see some comparisons of spend where the cost of public charging is about 70% of fossil fuel charging.
So first is digital and particularly digital selling, which now in Q2 has reached about 60% of all our new fuel card sales globally coming to us digitally.
We've redesigned our maximize sales conversion, and we're beginning investments at the top of the funnel in the form of digital TV, radio, Facebook advertising, which is driving about 50% more visitors to our websites, so obviously leading to incremental sales.
The last innovation I'd like to touch on is our effort to transform our fuel card UI, which is used by over 100,000 clients, really into a broader payment platform.
Our second half guidance calls for nearly $7 in cash earnings per share for the second half or approximately $14 annualized, again, forecasting record sales for the full year, which will flow revenue into next year.
We'll roll off $1 billion in interest rate hedges in January.
That will free up about $0.20 of incremental cash earnings per share.
And lastly, our two newest acquisitions, hoping to contribute in the $0.50 to $0.70 range of incremental cash earnings per share.

In the quarter, bad debt was $6 million or two basis points.
Interest expense increased 7% to $34.7 million due to a $6.2 million charge associated with our debt refinance, a higher balance on the new Term B note, partially offset by lower borrowings on our revolver and lower LIBOR rates on the unhedged portion of our debt.
