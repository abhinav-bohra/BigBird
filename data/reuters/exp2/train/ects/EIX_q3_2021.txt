And before I start commenting on the quarter, I wanted to note the senior leadership changes that we announced last week, Kevin Payne, SCE's President and CEO, plans to retire on December 1, and this is after 35 years with the company.
Today, Edison International reported core earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $1.67 a year ago.
Reflecting the year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing our 2021 earnings per share guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52.
We are also reiterating our longer-term earnings per share growth target of 5% to 7% through 2025.
First, SCE revised the best estimate of potential losses to $7.5 billion from $6.2 billion.
While the total estimate increased this quarter, SCE continued to make meaningful progress, settling claims and completed approximately $485 million of settlements.
SCE has now settled about 70% of the estimated exposure for the 2017 and 2018 events.
The agreement has a total value of $550 million, composed of about $110 million fine, $65 million of shareholder-funded safety measures and an agreement by SCE to waive its right to seek cost recovery for $375 million of uninsured claims payments out of the $5.2 billion total in the current best estimate.
In the SCD agreement, SCE did not admit imprudence, negligence or liability with respect to the 2017 and 2018 wildfire and mudslide events and will seek rate recovery of prudently incurred actual losses in excess of available insurance other than for the $375 million waived under the SED agreement.
SCE has installed over 1,000 miles of covered conductor year-to-date, bringing the total to 2,500 miles since program inception.
Over the past three years, the utility has replaced about 25% of its overhead distribution power lines in high fire risk areas with covered conductor.
This resulted in approximately 195,000 assets, undergoing 360-degree inspections in SCE's high-power risk area.
Using red flag warning days as a proxy for when the utility would use PSPS today, SCE would have prevented over 90% of the structures damaged or destroyed for fires larger than 1,000 acres associated with its infrastructure.
SCE estimates that it has reduced the probability of losses from catastrophic wildfires by 55% to 65% relative to pre-2018 levels.
To this end, in addition to securing over 230 megawatts of additional capacity from third parties, SCE plans to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage for this upcoming summer.
While the governor signed the largest climate package in state history, which included 24 bills and over $15 billion in climate, clean energy and wildfire preparedness funding, there is still an ongoing need for a lot more to be done.
So I would like to highlight a paper that we recently released and it's entitled "Mind the Gap: Policies for California's Countdown to 2030".
In the paper, we identified state and federal policy recommendations needed for California to meet its 2030 climate target, which is a foundational way point for the state to achieve its goal to the decarbonize its economy by 2045.
While California has made progress in reducing GHG emissions, closing the gap between the current trajectory and its 2030 goal requires a significant acceleration of effort.
It means quadrupling the average 1% annual reduction in GHG emissions achieved by the state since 2006, quadrupling that to 4.1% per year between 2021 and 2030.
Since the greater efficiency of electric motors and appliances will reduce customers' total costs across all energy commodities by 1/3 by 2045.
Edison International is committed to achieving net 0 GHG emissions across Scopes one, two and three by 2045.
Edison International reported core earnings of $1.69 per share for the third quarter 2021, an increase of $0.02 per share from the same period last year.
This true-up is reflected in several line items on the income statement for a net increase in earnings of $0.35.
Higher 2021 revenues contributed $0.55 and including $0.50 related to the 2021 GRC decision, $0.04 for CPUC revenues related to certain tracking accounts and $0.01 at FERC.
O&M had a positive variance of $0.28, mainly due to the establishment of the vegetation management and risk management balancing accounts, partially offset by increased wildfire mitigation costs due to the timing of regulatory deferrals in the third quarter of 2020.
Depreciation had a negative variance of $0.20, primarily driven by a higher asset base and a higher depreciation rate resulting from the 2021 GRC decision.
Income taxes had a negative variance of $0.41.
This includes $0.39 of lower tax benefits related to balancing accounts and the GRC true-up, which are offsetting revenue and have no earnings impact.
At EIX Parents and Other, the loss per share was $0.09 higher than in third quarter 2020.
The primary driver was preferred dividends on the $1.25 billion of preferred equity issued at the parent in March of this year.
As Pedro mentioned, SCE filed an advice letter for cost recovery of $1 billion of capital spending to construct about 535 megawatts of utility-owned storage.
We increased our 2022 capital expenditure forecast by approximately $900 million and lowered the forecast somewhat for 2023 through 2025 because these storage projects accelerate some, but not all of the capacity we previously forecasted in those years.
The net increase in the high end of the capital forecast for 2021 through 2025 is approximately $500 million.
This is the primary driver of the increase to the 2022 through 2025 rate base forecasts.
The results of these updates is a reduction to the 2021 rate base of $300 million.
Overall, these updates result in a projected rate base growth rate of 7% to 9% from 2021 to 2025.
Page 10 provides an update on several major approved and pending applications for recovery of amounts and regulatory assets.
SCE expects to collect over $1.4 billion in rates between now and 2024 related to already approved applications.
For the three pending applications shown in the middle of the slide, assuming timely regulatory decisions, SCE expects to collect another $844 million by the end of 2023.
Lastly, we show the remaining expected securitizations of AB 1054 capital expenditures.
This will allow SCE to securitize $518 million of wildfire mitigation capital expenditures.
Turning to page 11.
SCE is requesting an ROE of 10.53% with resets to its cost of debt and preferred financing, which would keep customer rates unchanged.
The utility's alternative request to maintain its ROE at 10.3% and reset the cost of debt and preferred would reduce customer rates by about $50 million in 2022.
pages 12 and 13 show our 2021 guidance and the preliminary modeling considerations for 2022.
As Pedro mentioned earlier, we are narrowing the 2021 earnings per share guidance range to $4.42 to $4.52.
Turning to page 14.
We see an average need of up to $250 million of equity content annually through 2025.
The significant new investment of $1 billion of utility-owned storage considerably accelerates the timing of the capital investment program and increases the overall opportunity as noted earlier.
To fund this growth, which is well above the high end of the capital spending range previously disclosed for next year, we anticipate accelerating the issuance of equity content securities from the 2023 through 2025 period into 2022.
The 2022 equity need will be in the range of $300 million to $400 million, and we will provide more specifics on the financing plan when we provide 2022 earnings per share guidance on the fourth quarter 2021 earnings call.
Consistent with our prior disclosure, we plan to issue securities with up to $1 billion of equity content to support investment-grade rating.
These investments are indicative of the longer-term opportunity associated with meeting customer needs and clean energy objectives and gives us confidence in reiterating our long-term earnings per share growth rate of 5% to 7% for 2021 through 2025.
