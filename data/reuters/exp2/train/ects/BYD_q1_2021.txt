Segment margins were nearly 40% this quarter and overall gaming revenues were up more than 2% from 2019 levels.
Most important, this operating segment -- this operating strength was broad-based as 15 of our 17 properties in this segment grew EBITDAR at a double-digit pace over their 2019 performance.
From February to March, daily rated play increased over 18% across all age and worth segments and was up nearly 25% in our 65 and up segment.
We also experienced an impressive increase in unrated play, which grew more than 33% on a comparable basis from February to March, a reflection of a strengthening consumer confidence across the country.
In the first quarter, new player sign-ups rose 35% over the fourth quarter.
On an overall basis, the worth of our first quarter sign-ups was over 50% higher than the first quarter of 2019.
One of these opportunities is the 65-and-over segment.
Compared to 2019, revenues were down nearly 11% during the February year-to-date period, while companywide EBITDAR after corporate expense rose 34% and margins improved nearly 1,200 basis points.

We generated over $200 million in cash during the quarter, resulting in approximately $730 million of cash on the balance sheet at quarter end.
And we currently have no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolving credit facility.
As we previously indicated we expect to generate over $20 million in EBITDAR from online this year.
And as more states legalize sports betting and FanDuel leads the way as one of the long-term winners in this space, our 5% equity stake will only continue to grow in value for our shareholders.
