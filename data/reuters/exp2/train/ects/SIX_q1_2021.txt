We have divided our call into 3 parts.
Through this past weekend our year-to-date attendance trends have accelerated at our open parks increasing to 79% of 2019 levels compared to 51% in the 4th quarter of 2020.
Total attendance for the quarter was 1.3 million guests a 38% decline from first quarter 2019.
Revenue in the quarter was down $46 million or 36% to $82 million.
As a result, our 2021 results include four calendar days in April when many of our parks operated during which we had 293,000 of attendance and this was inclusive of the Easter holiday weekend.
So far through this past weekend year-to-date attendance had open parks is trending at 79% versus 2019.
Total guest spending per capita increased 16% in the quarter versus 2019.
Applying a pro forma allocation to 2019 admissions spending per capita increased 17% and in-park spending per capita increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019.
Attendance from our active pass base in the first quarter represented 54% of total attendance versus 64% percent for the first quarter of 2019 demonstrating a more balanced approach to ticket sales.
On the cost side, cash operating and SG&A expenses versus 2019 decreased by $29 million or 20% primarily due to the following.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $46 million compared to a loss of $42 million in the first quarter 2019.
GAAP loss per share was $1.12 compared to a loss of $0.82 in 2019, primarily due to the lower attendance in our parks.
We are pleased with the retention of our active pass base of 4.1 million pass holders, which included 1.7 million members and 2.4 million traditional season pass holders at the end of first quarter 2021.
Our active pass base is up 1% compared to first quarter 2020 and down only 9% compared to first quarter 2019.
Deferred revenue as of April 4, 2021 was $245 million, up $96 million or 65% compared to first quarter 2020 and up $67 million or 38% compared to first quarter 2019.
The capital expenditures for the quarter was $23 million.
Our liquidity position, as of April 4 was $524 million this included $461 million of available revolver capacity net of $20 million of letters of credit and $63 million of cash.
This compares to a liquidity position of $618 million as of December 31, 2020.
Net cash outflow for the quarter was $95 million representing an average of $32 million per month.
This is significantly better than the projection of 53 million to $58 million per month that we gave on our last earnings call.
Less than $1 million of value in units has been put to Six Flags during the current year tender period that will end later today.
We expect the transformation plan to unlock $80 million to $110 million in incremental annual run rate EBITDA once fully implemented and attendance returns to 2019 levels.
In 2021, we expect to achieve $30 million to $35 million from our organizational redesign and other fixed cost reductions.
We have already realized more than $8 million through the first quarter of this year.
As part of our transformation plan, we have incurred $44 million in cost so far through the first quarter 2021 including the non-cash write-offs of $10 million that occurred in 2020.
We expect to incur the remaining $26 million in 2021 and 2022, the majority of which is related to investments in technology, including a new CRM system.
We launched more than 20 RFPs as part of our non-headcount cost savings initiatives and we are seeing very promising results especially in procurement savings.
In addition, our parks are located in each of the top 10 markets in the US, giving us access to the biggest and most lucrative markets around the country.
We are already seeing the early benefits in our improved single day ticket mix, our in-park spending growth and cost savings from our leaner organizational structure in our procurement efforts, but we're just getting started and we are on track to deliver the full $80 million to $110 million of incremental EBITDA when we are back in a normalized operating environment.
