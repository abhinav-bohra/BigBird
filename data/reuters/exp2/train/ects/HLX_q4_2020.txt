Over to slide 11.
Even in this environment and our usual lower utilization due to seasonal conditions, during the fourth quarter, we produced revenues of $160 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 9%, producing a gross profit of $14 million compared to $193 million revenue and $35 million gross profits in the third quarter.
Our year ended with revenues of $734 million, resulting in gross profits of 11%, producing the profits of $80 million.
EBITDA was $155 million, exceeding the top levels of revised guidance that we issued earlier in the year in response to the pandemic.
The Well Intervention fleets achieved utilization of 56% globally in the fourth quarter.
And the Robotics chartered vessel fleet achieved utilization of 100% globally, during the quarter.
Our fleets operated at 98.5% uptime efficiency and safety statistics in most categories were reduced compared to 2019, with many vessels now achieving multiple years being LTI free.
Performance in Brazil was at the usual high standards as both vessels performed very well, achieving utilization of 98% in Q4.
The Robotics chartered vessel fleet was very active in the quarter, between ROV support, trenching and renewable works globally, completing 336 days of utilization across seven vessels.
Slide 12 provides a more detailed review of our operations -- for operations [Phonetic] of Well Intervention business in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Q5000 had 89% utilization while continuing the work for BP until mid-February, undertaking ultra-deepwater production enhancement operations and performing extremely well.
The Q4000 performed well, with 78% utilization due to a small gap in schedule alignment between projects, completing work in ultra-deepwater for four clients.
Moving to slide 13.
The Well Enhancer achieved 26% utilization in Q4, working for two clients in the quarter, including completing one temporary abandonment scope for the -- environmental cleaning project, then undertaking a production enhancement scope.
Moving on to slide 14.
The Siem Helix 1 had 98% utilization in Q4 and completed abandonment work on six wells, working in an environmentally protected area.
The Siem Helix 2 had 99% utilization and completed a production enhancement work on one well and abandonment work on four wells during the quarter.
Moving on to slide 15 for our Robotics review.
In the fourth quarter, the chartered vessel fleet utilization was 100%, with both Grand Canyon vessels fully utilized and an additional 152 days of utilization from spot chartered vessels.
In the fourth quarter, in the North Sea, three vessels were utilized primarily on renewable energy projects, and the Grand Canyon III was utilized 100%, undertaking renewables and oil and gas trenching, and the Kristiansand and the World Peridot were 100% utilized, working 74 days combined, continuing site clearance and similar [Phonetic] works on a wind farm project.
The Skandi Acergy, a large construction vessel, the spot charter to undertake a decommissioning scope for 22 days as part of the combined Well Ops UK and Robotics projects.
And the Siem dye [Phonetic] was also project spot-chartered for 17 days on a further decommissioning scope.
In the APAC region, the Grand Canyon II had 100% utilization in Q4, performing works on the renewable energy projects in Taiwan, providing accommodation and installation support.
In the Gulf of Mexico, our pay-as-you-go vessel, the Ross Candies, had 39 days of utilization in Q4, working ROV support for five clients.
In the renewable sector, in 2020, we worked for nine clients on 16 projects.
In 2020, we had five vessels working in renewables, completing over 1,100 vessel days.
Over the course of last year, we had three trenching assets work in renewables, undertaking infield turbine-to-turbine trenching as well as export cable trenching, and 12 ROVs assigned to work in this sector.

Moving to slide 18, it outlines our debt instrument and the maturity profile at December 31, 2020.
Our total funded debt was $405 million.
Moving to slide 19, it provides an update on key balance sheet metrics, including long-term debt and net debt levels at year-end.
Our net debt approximately $58 million.
Our cash position at the end of Q4 was $291 million.
Our quarter-end net debt-to-book capitalization was 3%.
Moving to slide 21.
In Brazil, the Siem Helix 2's on contract into December, the Siem Helix 1 is on contract into April, and we're currently in commercial discussions with Petrobras regarding the continuation of work thereafter.
Providing more color by segment and region on slide 22, first, our Well Intervention.
In Brazil, the Siem Helix 2 is contracted into mid-December, the Siem Helix 1 is contracted into mid-April.
The vessel is scheduled to have an approximate 40-day dry-dock currently forecasted for mid-year.
Moving then to our Robotics segment, slide 23.
Moving to slide 24.
Our capex forecast is in the $20 million to $40 million range.
Our funded debt of $405 million is expected to decrease by $91 million as a result of scheduled principal payments in January as we paid off the balance of the Q5000 loan.
Our cash at year-end was $291 million.
We anticipate tax refunds in the amount of approximately $19 million in 2021 as a result of the tax changes from the CARES Act.
I'll skip slide 26 and leave it for your reference.
Our contract for the Q5000 in the Gulf of Mexico with BP for 270 days per year will not be extended.
