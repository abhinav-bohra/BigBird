Reconciling versus prior quarter, adjusted operating income quarter four, 2019, compared to adjusted operating income for prior quarter based on 19 million lower sales are 17 million, excluding exchange rate impacts, adjusted operating income decreased by 17 million to 41 million in Q4 2019 from 58 million in Q3 2019.
The main elements were: average selling prices had a negative impact of 5 million, representing a 0.8% ASP decrease.
Volume decreased with a negative impact of 6 million equivalent to a 1.8% decrease in volume, including a negative mix shift.
Fixed cost increased with a negative impact of 4 million as expected due to individually immaterial items.
Versus prior year, adjusted operating income quarter four 2019, compared to adjusted operating income in quarter four 2018, based on 166 million lower sales or 160 million lower excluding exchange rate impacts.
Adjusted operating income decreased by 79 million to 41 million in Q4 2019 from 120 million in Q4 2018.

Volume decreased with a negative impact of 124 million, representing a 9.7% decrease.
Inventory effects had a negative impact of 30 million.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were 95 million, sequentially higher by 2 million due to individually immaterial items and slightly lower than expected, primarily due to general belt-tightening measures.
For the year, selling, general and administrative expenses were $385 million versus 403 million in 2018.
2.1% lower, excluding exchange rate impacts, primarily due to incentive compensation expenses and general belt-tightening measures.
For Q1 2020, our expectations are approximately 102 million of SG&A expenses and approximately $400 million for the full year at constant exchange rates.
But as you know, we did repatriate approximately 189 million net of taxes during the earlier periods of 2019 and 724 million net of taxes during 2018.
There's approximately $100 million of additional earnings available for repatriation with taxes accrued.
We had total liquidity of 1.6 billion at quarter end.
Cash and short-term investments comprised 803 million and no amounts were outstanding on our revolving credit facility.
During the quarter, we were able to repurchase 3.95 million principal amount of our outstanding convertible debt instruments.
Of the principal 575 (sic) 575 million amount of the convertible debentures that was outstanding at the beginning of 2018, only 17 million or 3% remain outstanding at the end of 2019.
Our debt at year end is comprised of the convertible note due 2025 and the remaining convertible debentures due in 2040 and 2041.
The principal amount or face value of the converts totaled 617 million, 600 million related to the notes issued in 2018 and 17 million related to the remaining debentures.
The clean value of 499 million is net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs.
No principal payments are due until 2025, and the revolving credit facility expires in June 2024.
As announced in July, we are implementing global cost reduction programs intended to lower costs by approximately $15 million annually when fully implemented and to provide management rejuvenation.

The full-year effective tax rate on a GAAP basis was 27%.
These adjustments were a benefit of 11.6 million for Q4 and 9.6 million for the full-year 2019.
Our full-year GAAP tax rate also includes adjustments to uncertain tax provisions recorded in Q4, approximately 3.8 million.
A normalized tax rate for the full year was approximately 27% versus the 26% at year to date Q3.
Mathematically, this yields a normalized tax rate of 36% for Q4, impacted by the cumulative catch-up and low pre-tax earnings in Q4.
We expect our normalized effective tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 26% to 27%.
Total shares outstanding at year-end were 144 million.
