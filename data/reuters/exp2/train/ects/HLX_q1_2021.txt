We also extended the Siem Helix 1 for 120 days in Brazil, albeit at a slightly reduced rate.
Revenues were reported $163 million with a net loss of $3 million, and EBITDA of $36 million.
Our gross profit was $15 million or 9%.
On to Slide 8.
From a balance sheet perspective, our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $205 million with an additional 66 million in temporarily restricted cash associated with a short-term LLC for our work in Nigeria.
During the first quarter, we generated $40 million of operating cash flows and spent $1 million on capex, with the resulting free cash flow of $39 million.
We repaid the remaining 54 million balance on our Q5000 loan, reducing our long-term debt to hundred $336 million dollars.
Our net debt at the end of the quarter was $66 million and our net debt to book capital was 4%.
Moving on to Slide 10.
The COVID19 pandemic still presents many logistical challenges, including travel restrictions, quarantines, testing and screening personnel nearly 14,000 times to date.
We continue to work at high standards with 98.6% uptime efficiency with a very strong safety culture and performance leading to extremely low recordable incident rate.
Over to Slide 11.
Whilst operating through these pandemic conditions and with usual lower utilization due to seasonal weather conditions, during the first quarter we produced revenues of $163 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 9%, producing a gross profit of $15 million, compared to $160 million revenue and $14 million gross profits in the fourth quarter.
And $181 million revenue and $2 million gross profits in Q1 of 2020.
In the first quarter, we produced, EBIDTA for the quarter of $36 million compared to $35 million in Q4, and $19 million in Q1 of 2020.
Though our intervention fleets achieved utilization of 70% globally, achieving 100% utilization in Brazil, 88% utilization in the Gulf of Mexico, 38% utilization in North Sea and West Africa in the first quarter, with one vessel being warm stacked for the entire quarter.
The Robotics chartered-vessel fleet achieved utilization of 90% globally so it's 165 days during the quarter.
Performance in Brazil was at our usual high standards as both vessels performed very well achieving high utilization of 100% in Q1, mostly undertaken abandonment activity.
Slide 12 provides a more detailed review of our operations for our Well Intervention business in the Gulf of Mexico.
Q5000 had 100% utilization, while continuing work for BP until mid-February, undertaking ultra-deepwater production enhancement operations on one well and attempt abandonment on another well, performing extremely well.
The Q4000 performed well with 76% utilization due to the gap in schedule alignment between projects, completing work in ultra deepwater for two clients, including work on five wells for one client and then undertaking a flowline remediation for another client.
Moving to Slide 13.
The Well Enhancer achieved 46% utilization in Q1 working for 2 clients in the quarter, including completing one production enhancement scopes for one clients, followed by two production enhancement scopes for the other clients.
Moving to Slide 14.
The Siem Helix 1 had 100% utilization in Q1, and then completed abandonment work on four wells in an environmentally protected area of the northern coast of Brazil.
The vessel has been awarded a 120 day contract extension commenced in mid-April.
The Siem Helix 2 had 100% utilization and completed production enhancement work on two wells and the government work on four wells during the quarter.
Moving to Slide 15 for our Robotics review.
Robotics had another good quarter after a solid year in 2020, operating free vessels during the quarter, primarily working on non-Oil and Gas renewables and salvage related projects, resulting in the chartered-vessel fleet utilization of 90%.
During the first quarter, in the North Sea, the Grand Canyon III was utilized 80% and was taking renewables and oil and gas trenching.
In the APAC region, the Grand Canyon II had 100% utilization in Q1, performing works on renewable energy projects in Japan installing a tidal turbine.
We've also recently contracted our first work offshore beyond that would take a service spot vessel in early Q3 for approximately 50 days.
We currently have renewable trenching works contracted each year from 2021 to 2023 and have tender activity up to 2025.
We also have increased tender activity from 2021 to 2025 or other renewable services to include site survey, debris renewal, boulder removal, [Inaudible] clearance and destination, trenching installation support, accommodation supports and ROV support.
Over to Slide 16.
Our total funded debt decreased to $347 million, down from $405 million at December 31.
Moving to Slide 19, it provides an update on key balance sheet metrics, including long-term debt and net debt levels at year-end in March 31.
Our net debt approximated $66 million at quarter end.
During the quarter, we repaid approximately $58 million of debt.
Our long-term debt balance and net debt balance at 331 reflect the early adoption of ASU 2020-06 which simplify the accounting treatment of our outstanding convertible notes.
Our cash position at the end of Q1 was 205 million.
This balance does not include $66 million of restricted cash that supports a temporary project LC.
Our quarter-end net debt-to-book capitalization was 4%.
Revenue is in the range of $625 million to $700 million, EBITDA of $75 million to $100 million, and free cash flow generation between $45 million and $75 million.
In Brazil, the Siem Helix 2 is on contract into December, the Siem Helix one is now on contract into August at reduced rates.
Providing more color by segment and region on Slide 20 [Technical Issues] our Well Intervention segment Gulf of Mexico Q5000 was under contract for BP into Q2 and is completing the work on Droshky now.
Brazil, the Siem Helix 2 contract is under contracted into December with the Siem Helix 1 contracted into mid-August and is scheduled to have an approximate 30 to 40 day dry-dock in Q3 or Q4.
Moving to our Robotics segment, Slide 24.
Continuing on slide 25, our capex forecast range remains the same in the $20 million to $40 million range.
Reviewing our balance sheet, our funded debt decreased to $347 million with the repayment of the Q5000 loan with an additional $33 million decrease expected during the balance of '21 as a result of scheduled principal payments.
Our cash position at the end of Q1 was $205 million.
Once again, this does not include $66 million of restricted cash that supports a temporary project LC.
We received a $7 million tax refund in Q1 and anticipate an additional $12 million in 2021 as a result of the tax changes from the CARES Act.
I'll skip Slide 27 and leave it for your reference.
