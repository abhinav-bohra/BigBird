On the commercial side, our aggregate mix adjusted sales price increased by approximately 3% in the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, mix adjusted pricing increased by 3.5% despite a 4% decline in volume.
This is evidenced by our 7% year-to-date improvement in cash gross profit per ton.
According to Dodge, Vulcan-served states are expected to account for approximately 90% of the growth in warehouses and distribution centers over the next two years.

We expect that our 2020 adjusted EBITDA will range between $1.285 billion to $1.315 billion.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $403 million.
Adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 210 basis points as compared to the prior year despite an 8% decline in total revenues.

Our aggregates cash gross profit per ton increased by 7% to $7.15, while aggregates volume decreased by 4%.
SAG expense for the nine months declined by 5% or $14 million due to the execution of cost reduction initiatives and general cost control.
Aggregate sales price growth in the quarter of nearly 3% on a mix adjusted basis was widespread across our footprint, reflecting a positive pricing environment.
Asphalt gross profit improved by $3 million as compared to last year's quarter.

And we now expect to spend between $300 million and $350 million this year, a modest increase from our prior guidance of $275 million to $325 million.
For making marked progress toward our longer-term goal of $9 cash gross profit per ton and for driving our improved results through our four strategic disciplines.
