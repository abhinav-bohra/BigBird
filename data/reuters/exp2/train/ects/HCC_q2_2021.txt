The World Steel Association reported a 6.8% increase in global pig iron production for the first six months of the year, with China increasing its year-over-year production by 4%.
Excluding China, the rest of the world grew its pig iron production at an impressive rate of 13%.
During the second quarter, the Australian FOB indices experienced a gain of $82 per metric ton, rising from its low of $107 per metric ton on April 30 to its high of $194 per metric ton at the end of June.
Likewise, the CFR China indices gained $93 per metric ton from its low of $216 per metric ton on April 1st to its high of $309 per metric ton at the end of June.
We've been successful in placing some of our premium coals into China during the second quarter while capturing 100% of the CFR China index price on the day of the sale.
Sales volume in the second quarter was 1.8 million short tons compared to 1.5 million short tons in the same quarter last year.
Our sales by geography in the second quarter were 31% into Europe, 6% in South America and 63% into Asia.
Production volume in the second quarter of 2021 was 1.2 million short tons compared to 2.1 million short tons in the same quarter of last year.
These results also include a zero-day longwall move during the second quarter at Mine 7, which is accomplished by having the extra set of longwall shields we purchased some time ago.
Our gross price realization for the second quarter 2021 was 100% of the Platts premium Low-Vol FOB Australian index price and was the same amount achieved in the prior year period.
Our spot sales volume in the second quarter was approximately 34% of total volumes, down from 48% in the first quarter when compared to our normal expectation of approximately 20%.
For the second quarter of 2021 the company recorded a net loss on a GAAP basis of approximately $5 million or a loss of $0.09 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $9 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the second quarter, excluding the nonrecurring business interruption expenses, idle mine expenses and incremental stock compensation was $0.25 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.18 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA was $65 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $20 million in the same quarter last year.
The quarterly increase was primarily driven by a 24% increase in sales volume and a 14% increase in average net selling prices.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 29% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to 12% in the same quarter last year.
Total revenues were approximately $227 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $164 million in the same quarter last year.

The Platts Premium Low-Vol FOB Australian index price averaged $19 per metric ton higher were up 16% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the same quarter last year.

Demurrage and other charges reduced our gross price realization to an average net selling price of $123 per short ton in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $108 per short ton in the same quarter last year.
Cash cost of sales was $152 million or 68% of mining revenues in the second quarter, compared to $130 million or 82% of mining revenues in the same quarter of 2020.
The increase in total dollars was primarily due to a $31 million impact of higher sales volume, partially offset by $9 million of lower variable cost and a concerted effort to keep our costs low and in line with lower production.
Cash cost of sales per short ton FOB port was approximately $83 in the second quarter, compared to $88 in the same period of 2020.
Depreciation and depletion expenses for the second quarter of 2021 were $40 million, compared to $22 million in last year's quarter.
The increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to 24% higher sales volume as these expenses are first capitalized into inventory and then relieved when the tons are sold.
In addition, this quarter included approximately $5 million of Mine four depreciation that would have normally been capitalized into inventory with production.
SG&A expenses were about $11 million or 5% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2021 and were higher than the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher non-cash stock compensation expense, which included an incremental $4 million associated with the accelerated vesting of awards to certain individuals that reached retirement eligibility.
During the second quarter, we incurred incremental non-recurring business interruption expenses of $7 million directly related to the ongoing UMWA strike.
We incurred $11 million of expenses associated with the idling of Mine four and reduced operations at Mine seven.
Net interest expense was about $8 million in the second quarter, included interest on our outstanding debt, interest on equipment financing leases, plus amortization of our debt issuance cost associated with our credit facilities partially offset by interest income.
We recorded an income tax benefit of $7 million during the second quarter of 2021, compared to a benefit of $4 million in the same quarter last year.
The year-to-date, tax expense include a non-cash charge of $25 million recognized upon the establishment of a valuation allowance against our state deferred income tax assets.
Turning to cash flow, during the second quarter of 2021, we generated $53 million of free cash flow, which resulted from cash flows provided by operating activities of $69 million.
Thus cash used for capital expenditures and mine development cost of $15 million.
Free cash flow in the second quarter of 2021 was positively impacted by a $32 million decrease in net working capital.
Cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures and mine development costs were $15 million during the second quarter of 2021, compared to $31 million in the same quarter last year.
Cash flows used by financing activities were $9 million in the second quarter of 2021 and consisted primarily of payments for capital leases of $6 million and the payment of the quarterly dividend of $3 million.
Our total available liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $288 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of 267 and $21 million available under our ABL facility.
This is net of borrowings of $40 million and outstanding letters of credit of approximately $9 million.
Our balance sheet has a leverage ratio of 1.3 times adjusted EBITDA.
In closing, we believe we are well-positioned to fulfill our customer volume commitments for 2021 of approximately 4.9 million to 5.5 million short tons through a combination of existing coal inventory and expected production during the rest of the year.
Those numbers assume that Mine four continues to be idle and that production continues at Mine 7, although at lower than usual rates.
