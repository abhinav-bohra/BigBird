Our fiscal year-to-date total case incident rate, or TCIR, is 0.6.
We have now demonstrated three consecutive quarters of sub-1.0 TCIR performance as an organization, which is exceptional safety performance.
I look forward to achieving our next safety performance milestone as we pursue safety excellence on our path to 0.
Over the last four quarters, we have generated $189 million in free cash flow and ended the third quarter with total liquidity of $539 million, including $244 million of cash and no near-term financial obligations.
In our medical end-use market, sales were up 7% sequentially.
I'll start on Slide 8, the income statement summary.
Net sales in the third quarter were $351.9 million and sales, excluding surcharge, totaled $298.1 million.
Sales, excluding surcharge, were effectively flat sequentially on 5% lower volume.
Compared to the third quarter a year ago, sales decreased 40% on 39% lower volume.
SG&A expenses were $47.8 million in the third quarter, down $3 million from the same period a year ago, reflecting the actions we took to reduce costs, including the elimination of about 20% of our global salaried positions late last fiscal year, managing discretionary spend closely as well as the impacts of remote working conditions that reduced certain administrative costs such as travel and entertainment.
Sequentially, SG&A costs were higher by $5.6 million, reflecting incremental costs in the quarter associated with going live with our new ERP implementation as well as the incremental depreciation costs associated with the ERP system.
The current quarter's operating results include $7.6 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, including inventory writedowns, associated with our ongoing actions to reduce cost and narrow focus in our additive business unit within our PEP segment.
In addition, our results for the third quarter include $2.7 million in COVID-19-related costs, which are down slightly from the $3.9 million of COVID-19 costs incurred in our recent second quarter.
The operating loss was $40 million in the current quarter when excluding the impact of the special items, namely the restructuring and asset impairment charges and the COVID-19 costs.
Adjusted operating loss was $29.7 million compared to operating income of $58.7 million in the prior year period and adjusted operating loss of $32.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.
Although not shown on the slide, in the current quarter, other expense net includes an $8.9 million noncash pension settlement charge related to our largest qualified pension plan.
As a result of the remeasurement, we expect pension expense to be lower by about $3 million for the full fiscal year versus what we had anticipated.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.2%.
For the balance of the year, we currently expect the tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 30%.
Earnings per share for the quarter was a loss of $0.84 per share.
When excluding the impacts of the special items, adjusted earnings per share was a loss of $0.54 per share.
Net sales for the quarter were $299.6 million or $246.5 million, excluding surcharge.
Compared to the third quarter last year, sales, excluding surcharge, decreased 38% on 37% lower volume.
Sequentially, sales, excluding surcharge, were essentially flat on 3% lower volume.
SAO reported an operating loss of $9.9 million for the current quarter.
The same quarter a year ago, SAO's operating income was $76.4 million.
And in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, SAO reported an operating loss of $11.6 million.
During the current quarter, SAO reduced inventory by approximately $15 million and, year-to-date, has reduced inventory by $146 million.
In addition, the current quarter's results reflect approximately $2.1 million of direct incremental costs associated with our efforts to protect our facilities and employees in light of COVID-19.
This compares with $3.2 million in COVID-19 costs in our recent second quarter.
Based on current expectations, we anticipate SAO will generate an operating loss of approximately $5 million to $7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.
Now turning to Slide 10 and our PEP segment results.
Net sales, excluding surcharge, were $64.9 million, which were down 39% from the same quarter a year ago and up 20% sequentially.
In the current quarter, PEP reported an operating loss of $3.3 million.
This compares to an operating loss of $7.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and an operating loss of $0.3 million in the same quarter last year.
As we look ahead, we believe that demand conditions will gradually begin to improve in the coming quarters, and we currently anticipate PEP will generate an operating loss of $0 million to $1 million in our upcoming fourth quarter.
Now turning to Slide 11 and a review of free cash flow.
In the current quarter, we generated $4 million of cash from operating activities.
Over the last four quarters, beginning with our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we have reduced inventory by just under $300 million, including $182 million of reductions to date in fiscal year 2021.
In the third quarter, we spent $19 million on capital expenditures.
We expect to spend about $110 million to $120 million on capital expenditures for fiscal year 2021 depending on the timing of certain projects expected to be completed in the balance of this fiscal year.
With those details in mind, we reported negative $25 million of free cash flow in the quarter.
With that in mind, we are targeting at least $50 million of positive free cash flow in our upcoming fourth quarter.
From a liquidity perspective, we ended the current quarter with total liquidity of $539 million, including $244 million of cash and $295 million of available borrowings under our credit facility.
Keep in mind, in the current quarter, we amended and extended our credit facility and reduced the size of our facility from $400 million to $300 million, which is reflected in the sequential change in liquidity.
With that, I'll move on to the next slide, Slide 12, to talk about our capital structure.
Oil prices have increased by 50% in calendar year 2021, and we have seen limited capital expenditures released for some major projects that offer up specific opportunities.
We ended the third quarter with $244 million in cash and over $539 million in total liquidity.
Our core business is established and built upon 130 years of metallurgical expertise, manufacturing and processing experience and a commitment to delivering mission-critical solutions to customers in some of the largest industries in the world.
