While the results from any one quarter and in fact, any one year or anything less than about five years are about 80% noise and 20% substance, it's always more fun to talk about good numbers than bad ones and those are good numbers.
When our accountants hand me the table that displays our returns, the cumulative table at the end shows the investment results that started in 1989.

When you get to 31 and three-quarter year time frames, I would argue that the noise fades away and that you're left with substantive fundamentals.
On the top line, revenues grew 35% from $2 billion to $2.7 billion.
Our EBITDA grew 7% from $284 million to $304 million through the first nine months.
