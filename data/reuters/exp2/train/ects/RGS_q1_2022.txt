During the quarter, we utilize our at the market or ATM program and raised $37.2 million in unrestricted cash.
Our initial ATM was registered for up to $50 million.
These changes are expected to result in annual savings of approximately $5 million, and I will let Kersten outline the revised G&A range based on those recent changes.
Q1 of fiscal '22 saw improving same-store sales of 23%.
We are the industry leader with almost 100 years of heritage and operating experience.
We comprise over 5,600 salons, spanning brands with some of the highest awareness levels in the industry.
Our brands represent 45% of large chain hair care spend, spending that is not threatened by replacement technology.
Yesterday, we reported on a consolidated basis, first quarter revenues of $78 million, which represented a $34 million increase from the prior year.
On a two-year basis, a comparison to pre-COVID systemwide comps were down 17% in the quarter.
This is an improvement over Q4 when we were down 21%.
Total system sales increased approximately 8% from the fourth quarter.
We reported an operating loss of $6 million during the quarter compared to an operating loss of $32 million in the prior quarter.
First quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA loss was $6 million compared to a loss of $23 million in Q4 2021.
Our franchise product sales business and company-owned salons contributed losses of approximately $3 million and $1.6 million, respectively, both of which are not part of our go-forward business.
The $5 million in annual savings Felipe mentioned will be seen in our Q2 forward.
With the recent G&A changes, we now expect our end state run rate G&A to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million annually.
As of September 30, we had $148 million of liquidity, including $82 million of available revolver capacity and $46 million of cash.
Our net available liquidity as of September 30 was $73 million, which reflects our minimum liquidity covenant requirements and the permitted add-back of the shortfall in certain refranchising proceeds in accordance with our credit agreement.
The $19 million quarterly increase in net available liquidity was due to utilizing the ATM.
We raised $37 million in total, of which $32 million settled in September and $5 million settled in October.
In the first quarter, we used $12 million of cash from operations, which is approximately $8 million less than our fourth quarter cash use of $20 million, driven in part by continued improving comp.
Removing $2 million of cash used on onetime items, our cash used was $10 million in the first quarter.
