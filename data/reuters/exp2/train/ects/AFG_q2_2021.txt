AFG reported core net operating earnings of $2.39 per share, an impressive 257% increase year-over-year.
Improved results from the companys $1.6 billion of alternative investments were partially offset by lower other property and casualty net investment income, primarily due to lower short-term interest rates.
Annualized core operating return on equity in the second quarter was a strong 14.7%.
Youll see that the second quarter 2021 net earnings per share of $11.70 included after-tax noncore items totaling $9.31 per share.
These noncore items included earnings from our discontinued Annuity operations, inclusive of an after-tax gain on the sale of $8.14 per share.
Second quarter 2021 noncore items also included $0.40 per share in after-tax noncore net realized gains on securities.
Based on results through the first half of the year, we now expect AFGs core net operating earnings in 2021 to be in the range of $8.40 to $9.20, up from our previous range of $7 to $8 per share, an increase of $1.30 per share at the midpoint of our guidance.
As youll see on slide five, this guidance range continues to assume 0 earnings on AFGs $2.2 billion in parent company cash as we continue to consider alternatives for deployment of the remaining proceeds from the sale of the Annuity business.
Furthermore, the above guidance reflects a normal crop year and an annualized return of approximately 8% on alternative investments over the remaining two quarters of 2021.

The details surrounding our $16.1 billion investment portfolio are presented on slides nine and 10.
AFG recorded second quarter 2021 net realized gains on securities of $34 million after tax.
Approximately $29 million of the after-tax realized gains pertained to equity securities that AFG continued to own at June 30, 2021.
Pretax unrealized gains on AFGs fixed maturity portfolio were $260 million at the end of the second quarter.
The annualized return on alternative investments reported in core operating earnings in the second quarter of 2021 was 21.1%.
The average annual return on these investments over the past five calendar years was approximately 10%.
These properties represented approximately 55% of our alternative investment portfolio at June 30, 2021.
As you can see on slide 10, our investment portfolio continues to be high quality with 88% of our fixed maturity portfolio rated investment grade and 98% of our P&C group fixed maturities portfolio with an NAIC designation of one or 2, its two highest categories.
On May 28, 2021, AFG completed the sale of our Annuity businesses to MassMutual, the highlights of which are included on slide 11.
Initial cash proceeds from the sale based on the preliminary closing balance sheet were $3.5 billion.
AFG recognized an after-tax noncore gain on the sale of $697 million or $8.14 per AFG share upon closing.
Prior to the completion of the transaction, AFGs Property and Casualty Group acquired approximately $480 million in real estate-related partnerships, and AFG parent acquired approximately $100 million in directly owned real estate from Great American Life Insurance Company.
Over the last 10 years, this business generated an internal rate of return of approximately 16%, as shown on slide 12.
As you will see on slide 13, for the 10-year period ended December 31, 2020, AFGs Annuity segment net earnings were 108% of Annuity core operating earnings compared to only 74% for the life insurance industry overall.
When we include the five months of Annuity earnings during 2021, Annuity net earnings as a percent of Annuity core operating earnings improved to 110%, demonstrating the quality of our earnings relative to the industry.
In connection with the closing of this transaction, the company declared a special onetime cash dividend of $14 per share totaling $1.2 billion, which was paid in mid-June.
Earlier this week, we paid an additional $170 million in connection with an additional $2 per share special dividend declared in July.
We repurchased $114 million of AFG common stock during the quarter at an average price per share of $116.13 when you adjust it for the special dividend.
During the quarter, in addition to the share repurchases and the special dividend that Craig mentioned earlier, we returned $42 million to our shareholders through the payment of our regular $0.50 per share quarterly dividend.
With the gain on the Annuity sale, annualized growth in adjusted book value per share plus dividends was a strong 47% in the first six months of 2021.
Our excess capital is approximately $3.2 billion at the end of June.
This number included parent company cash and investments of approximately $3 billion.
As of June 30, AFG parent had invested approximately $500 million of the proceeds from the Annuity sale in high-quality fixed maturity investments with an average life of less than 0.5 year and a yield of approximately 1.2%.
While all of AFGs excess capital is available for internal growth or acquisitions, over $700 million of that excess capital can be used for share repurchases and special dividends above and beyond the nearly $1.5 billion distributed to shareholders through the $14 per share special dividend paid in June, the $2 special dividend paid Monday of this week and the $114 million in second quarter share repurchases while still staying within our most restrictive debt to capital guideline.
Specifically, our P&C insurance subsidiaries are projected to have capital in excess of the levels expected by rating agencies in order to maintain their high current ratings, and we have no debt maturities before 2026.
