At the time of our earnings call back in May, we were in the early stages of the pandemic and 63% of our tenants were open, and April collections were 64%.
As I report today, I am pleased to say that 94% of our businesses are open, and we collected 81% of our rents during the second quarter and have collected 86% for July so far.
Our business model, which has been crafted from the lessons we learned during the 2008 recession and prior economic downturn, performs exceptionally well in good times and minimizes financial risk in these toughest of times.
And third, our experienced management team that extends beyond this 12 years they worked together producing results for our investors, and consistently demonstrating an ability to capture and capitalize on opportunities that others may miss.
Keep in mind that we have a large tenant base and tenant can impact our revenue stream more than 3% if they go viral.
From the beginning of the pandemic, Whitestone associates worked tirelessly, continuing to manage in these properties with an expansive base of approximately 1,400 tenants.
We also know that we have continued to gain their confidence by delivering meaningful value and producing stable, predictable cash flow, value appreciation through asset management and leasing that increased 2% to 3% annually.
Entering the pandemic, our overall occupancy stood at 89.7%.
Despite having a significant amount of our tenant businesses closed or severely impacted for all or part of the quarter, we only had a handful of tenants closed for good, such that the portfolio occupancy rate held up well, ending the quarter at 89.2%.
Also, our annualized space rent per square foot held relatively flat at $19.58.
While our square foot leasing activity was down 37% from the second quarter of 2019, we were pleased with positive leasing spreads of 13.5% and 3.4% on renewals and new leases signed in the quarter.
As Jim mentioned, for the quarter, we collected 81% of our rents.
We have also entered into rent deferral agreements for 5% of our second quarter rents.
Today, 94% of our businesses are open.
To date, we have collected 86% of our July rents which compares favorably to Q2 and to the April collections of 64% we reported at this time last quarter.
Funds from operations for the quarter was $9.6 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to $11.1 million, or $0.27 per share, in the same quarter of the prior year.
The decrease is primarily due to the impact of the pandemic, which resulted in a charge of $2.8 million, or $0.07 per share, related to the collectibility of revenue, which includes $500,000, or $0.01 per share, for noncash straight-line rent receivables.
For the quarter, we recorded a bad debt reserve of $2.3 million, which excludes reserves for straight-line rents and unbilled amounts.
Our cash collections for the quarter were 81%.
So with the remaining 19% of unselected rents, which includes 5% of agreed rent deferrals, we reserved 41%.
Additionally, we have converted approximately 70 tenants, representing 3% of our GLA and 3.2% of our revenue, to cash basis accounting.
Those tenants paid 41% of their own rent in Q2.
We have provided some additional details on our collections that can be found on page 25 of the supplemental.
Today, we have approximately $45 million in cash, representing an $8 million or 22% increase since March 31.
We have one $9 million mortgage loan maturing in 2020, which we expect to refinance in the third quarter, and no debt maturities in 2021.
Currently, we have $110.5 million of capacity and $1.2 million of borrowing availability under our credit facility.
Borrowing availability under the credit facility is largely driven by trailing 12-month net operating income for unencumbered properties.
