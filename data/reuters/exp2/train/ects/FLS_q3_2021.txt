Third quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share were $0.38 and $0.29, respectively.
The combination of supply chain, logistics and labor availability shifted approximately $60 million of expected revenue out of the quarter.
Our third quarter bookings of $912 million represented a 13% increase over prior year, continuing this year's trend of strong year-over-year quarterly growth.
Aftermarket orders of $495 million increased 16% and are at pre-COVID levels.
Original equipment bookings increased 9% year-over-year to $417 million.
Our project or original equipment business continues to lag in the recovery with less than a handful of larger projects awarded in the quarter with only two project orders in the $10 million to $20 million range.
Each of our core end markets delivered year-over-year growth in the third quarter, with oil and gas up 33%, while chemical and power were both up 17%.
Water bookings were also particularly strong, up 46% and included a $10 million desalination award.
Some of these markets were up over 30%.
We do expect our overall bookings to recover more toward our first half 2021 quarterly run rate of approximately $950 million in the fourth quarter.
We believe full year bookings will grow year-over-year in the 10% range.
Approximately $60 million of revenue and $20 million in gross profit that we had previously expected to recognize in the period was deferred from the third quarter due to supply chain issues, global logistics and labor availability.
And we are seeing the benefits from the supplier consolidation and the quality work that was completed in the Flowserve 2.0 transformation.
Our reported earnings per share of $0.38 exceeded our adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 due to a $16.6 million discrete tax adjustment from the reversal of certain deferred tax liabilities.
Partially offsetting the $0.13 gain on taxes, our adjusted earnings per share also excludes $0.04 of items, including realignment expenses, below-the-line FX impact and certain costs incurred in our debt refinancing.
In addition to the revolver, we also obtained a $300 million fully drawn term loan, which included participation from a minority-owned depository institution in addition to most of the syndicate banks in the revolver.
In September, we also accessed the debt capital markets and issued $500 million in new 2.8% 10-year senior notes.
In October, we used all the proceeds from the term loan and senior notes in addition to some excess cash, together totaling $842 million, to fully redeem our senior notes with maturities in 2022 and 2023.
As Scott mentioned, the third quarter was impacted by supply chain, logistics and labor headwinds that delayed roughly $60 million of expected revenue out of the quarter.
Revenue decreased 6.3% to $866 million, largely due to the deferred revenue I just mentioned.
All in, we had an 11% decline in original equipment, or OE, sales, driven by FPD's 20% decrease, but partially offset by FCD's 2% increase.
Beyond the challenges in the third quarter, FPD continues to be impacted by its 2021 beginning OE backlog, which was down roughly 25% versus the start of 2020.
Aftermarket sales remained relatively resilient in total, down roughly 1%, where FCD's 12% increase was offset by FPD's 3% decline.
Our third quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 190 basis points to 29.6%, primarily due to the OE sales decline and the related under-absorption particularly at our engineer-to-order sites in both segments, the other previously mentioned disruptive impacts as well as higher logistics costs, which increased 25% year-over-year.
These headwinds were partially offset by a 3% mix shift toward higher-margin aftermarket sales.
On a reported basis, the gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 29.3% was driven by the factors previously mentioned and were partially mitigated by the $3 million decrease in realignment charges versus prior year.
Third quarter adjusted SG&A increased $7.4 million to $200 million versus prior year, primarily due to a $3 million increase in expense related to our incurred but not reported potential reserves, increased R&D spending and the return from travel costs which were a temporary benefit in 2020 as well as headwinds from foreign exchange.
Reported SG&A was flat to the prior period, and these increases were offset by a $7 million decrease in adjusted items and disciplined cost control offset the return of some of last year's temporary cost benefits.
Third quarter adjusted operating margins of 7% decreased 390 basis points year-over-year as did FPD's adjusted operating margin, primarily due to increased under-absorption related to a 20% OE revenue decline.
FPD's adjusted operating margin decreased 170 basis points year-over-year to 10.5% due to sales mix and slightly higher SG&A as a percent of sales.
And to that point, had Flowserve not experienced the $60 million revenue deferral, our adjusted operating margins would have been flat to modestly up on a sequential basis.
Third quarter reported operating margin decreased 280 basis points year-over-year to 6.6%, where the previously discussed challenges more than offset the $10 million reduction of adjusted items.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 15.2% was driven by our income mix globally and favorable resolution of certain foreign audits in the quarter.
The full year adjusted tax rate is expected to normalize in the 20% range.
Our third quarter cash balance of $1.5 billion reflected the debt refinancing discussed earlier as well as solid cash flow performance in the quarter.
Our net debt position of $652 million at the end of the third quarter has declined by over $300 million in the last three years.
On a year-to-date basis through the third quarter, operating cash flow of $151 million is up nearly $37 million versus the prior year, while free cash flow of $117 million has increased 73% or $49 million over the prior year.
In the third quarter, we delivered $78 million or approximately 67% of our year-to-date free cash flow total.
This third quarter performance is up versus the comparable period in 2020 despite voluntary funding of a $20 million pension contribution during the quarter compared to no funding a year ago.
And with our typically seasonally strong fourth quarter ahead, we are confident in our ability to stay on pace to deliver a free cash flow conversion of over 100% of our adjusted net income once again in 2021.
Working capital was a cash source of $56 million in the third quarter and a $47 million increase versus last year.
As a percentage of sales, primary working capital saw a modest 40 basis point sequential increase to 29.8% due primarily to the market disruptions in the quarter.
Since year-end 2020, backlog has increased $115 million, while inventory and contract assets and liabilities have declined $16 million.
Major uses in the third quarter include dividends and capex of $26 million and $11 million, respectively.
As I just mentioned, we also contributed $20 million to our U.S. cash balance pension plan to keep it largely fully funded.
In the fourth quarter, major uses expected include the completed retirement of the 2022 and 2023 senior notes, the $26 million October dividend and a higher level of capex spend.
We now expect a full year revenue decline of 3.5% to 4.5% and reported an adjusted full year earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.10 and $1.40 to $1.45, respectively.
In terms of other guidance metrics, our net interest expense remains unchanged at $55 million to $60 million and we modestly lowered our full year adjusted tax rate guidance to approximately 20%.
From a bookings standpoint, we now expect full year 2021 bookings to increase in the 10% range year-over-year.
The major categories of our full year cash usages include the October debt retirement, dividends and share repurchases of roughly $120 million, capital expenditures in the $65 million range, the third quarter's pension contribution and the funding of our now modest realignment programs.
We are still in the early innings of tapping into this growing market, and our third quarter bookings included over $25 million of energy transition work, including biodiesel conversions, solar power projects and energy efficiency upgrades.
The facility will produce sustainable aviation fuel that when compared to fossil jet fuel has the potential to cut life cycle emissions from aviation by up to 80%.
Flowserve helped compress the engineering and approval time from a normal 12-week -- 12-month cycle to seven months, supporting an earlier plant start-up and delivering a faster payback.
The project is expected to reduce CO2 emissions from diesel production by up to 600,000 tons per year.
We are currently working with over 40 customers and have connected nearly 5,000 assets.
As I indicated earlier, we expect fourth quarter bookings to be roughly $950 million, depending on the level of project activity.
By achieving this level, our 2021 bookings would deliver a 10% year-over-year growth rate.
Flowserve 2.0 has provided the visibility and business processes to address these issues, and our teams are currently working to resolve and mitigate the issues that arose in the third quarter.
We believe in the company's long-term ability to achieve our original targets, including operating margins in the 15% to 17% range, ROIC of 15% to 20% and to continue free cash flow conversion in excess of 100%, which we've already demonstrated.
