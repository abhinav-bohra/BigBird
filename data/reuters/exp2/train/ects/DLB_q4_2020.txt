Fourth quarter revenue was $271 million, compared to $247 million in Q3 and $299 million in Q4 of last year.
Our revenue guidance coming into the fourth quarter was a range of $225 million to $255 million.
So compared to guidance, revenues were better than what we projected as we had a true-up of about $25 million in the quarter related to Q3 shipments, which was about $15 million higher than the true-up that we had last quarter, and with most of that improvement coming from TVs and set-top boxes, and PCs.
Total company revenue in Q4 increased sequentially by $24 million compared to Q3, as we benefited from higher unit volumes in TVs, set-top boxes, DMAs and PCs, along with the higher true-up that I just discussed.
Now looking at Q4 on a year-over-year basis, total company revenue is down by $28 million from last year's Q4 and we can attribute that mainly to COVID-19, especially in products and services, which were down by about $20 million or nearly 60% below last year.
The composition of Q4 revenue was $257 million in licensing and $14 million in products and services.
Broadcast represented about 47% of total licensing in the fourth quarter.
Broadcast revenues increased by about 2% year-over-year, helped by the higher true-up related to the Q3 shipments and also driven by higher adoption in TVs and set-top boxes.
On a sequential basis, broadcast was up by about 35% due to higher volume in TVs and set-top boxes along with higher recoveries and the higher true-up.
Mobile represented approximately 15% of total licensing in Q4.
Mobile was down by about 13% over last year due to lower recoveries, but partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Technologies.
For the sequential comparison, I should point out that last quarter Q3, Mobile was about 33% licensing, which was higher than normal, and that was due to timing of revenue under customer contracts, so we came into Q4 expecting Mobile revenue to decline this quarter and return to a more normalized percentage of revenue, which is what it did.
So accordingly Mobile revenue was down sequentially by about 50%, and that was primarily due to timing of revenue under customer contracts.
Consumer electronics represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, CE licensing was down by about 8%, mainly due to lower recoveries.
On a sequential basis, CE was about 68% higher than Q3.
And as a reminder, Q3 was lower than usual and only 9% of licensing because of timing under contract.
PC represented about 12% of total licensing in Q4.
PC was higher than last year by about 26%, helped by the higher true-up and also because of the increased adoption of Dolby Technologies.
And sequentially, PC was up by about 32% that's for similar reasons.
Other markets represented about 13% of total licensing in the fourth quarter and they were down by about 19% year-over-year due to significantly lower Dolby Cinema box office share and that's because of the COVID restrictions and lack of big titles, and also because of lower revenues from gaming due to console life cycles and/or recoveries in automotive.
On a sequential basis, other markets was up by about 32%, driven by higher revenue from gaming and from via admin fees and that's the patent pool that we administered.
Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $14.3 million in Q4, compared to $11.8 million in Q3 and $34 million in last year's Q4.
Total gross margin in the fourth quarter was 84.3% on a GAAP basis and 85.1% on a non-GAAP basis.
Products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $15.5 million in the fourth quarter and a large portion of that consisted of charges for excess and obsolete inventory associated with conferencing hardware and that relates back to what I just said a minute ago, about our plans in that space.
Going forward into Q1, we anticipate that products and services margin will still be negative, but more along the lines of around minus $3 million or minus $4 million.
Products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $14.1 million in the fourth quarter, and my comments here are similar to what I just said for GAAP gross margins.
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were slightly above the high-end of the range that we had guided, coming in at a $198.7 million, compared to $182.9 million in Q3.
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $176.5 million, which is within our range and that was compared to $159.2 million in the third quarter, and basically the same comments that I made in GAAP apply here as well.
Operating income in the fourth quarter was $30.1 million on a GAAP basis or 11.1% of revenue, compared to $51.2 million or 17.1% of revenue in Q4 of last year.
Operating income in the fourth quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $54.3 million or 20% of revenue, compared to $77.6 million or 26% of revenue in Q4 of last year.
Income tax in Q4 was 21.8% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
Net income on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $26.8 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $43.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share in last year's Q4.
Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter was $45.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $67.6 million or $0.66 per diluted share in Q4 of last year.
During the fourth quarter, we generated about $113 million in cash from operations, which compares to about $130 million generated in last year's fourth quarter.
We ended the fourth quarter with nearly $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
During Q4, we bought back about 640,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $187 million of stock repurchase authorization still available to us.
We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share.
The dividend will be payable on December 4, 2020 to shareholders of record on November 24, 2020.
Total revenue in FY '20 was $1,162 million that compares to $1,241 million in the prior year with a year-over-year decline due to the impact from COVID-19.
Within total revenue, licensing was $1,079 million, which was down about $28 million from last year due to lower consumer activity because of the pandemic, while products and services revenue was $83 million for the year, down about $51 million from last year due mainly to lower demand from the cinema industry because of restrictions brought on also by the pandemic.
Operating income for the full-year FY '20 was $219 million on a GAAP basis or about 19% of revenue and operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $318 million or about 27% of revenue.
Net income on a GAAP basis was $231 million or $2.25 per diluted share and net income on a non-GAAP basis was $305 million or $2.97 per diluted share.
And cash flow from operations for the full-year was $344 million and that's slightly up from the previous year, where cash flow from operations was $328 million.
In the first quarter of FY '21, we anticipate that total revenue could range from $330 million to $360 million.
Within that, we estimate that licensing could range from $320 million to $345 million, while products and services is projected to range from $10 million to $15 million.
So with that in mind, and based on what we currently see and having just gone over the Q1 revenue outlook, we currently see our Q2 revenue scenario looking like a range of about $270 million to $300 million.
And doing the math for you on the first half of FY '21 by combining the Q1 and Q2 figures that I just went over, our current outlook scenario assumes a first half FY '21 revenue range of $600 million to $660 million.
So let me now finish up by providing the outlook on the rest of the P&L for Q1, already highlighted the revenue range scenario of $330 million to $360 million.
So Q1 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 90% to 91%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 91% to 92%.
Within that, products and services gross margin is estimated to range from minus $3 million to minus $4 million on a GAAP basis, and from minus $2 billion to minus $3 million on a non-GAAP basis.
Operating expenses in Q1 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $207 million to $219 million.
Included in this range is approximately $7 million to $9 million of restructuring charges for severances and related benefits that are being provided to employees that are impacted by the actions that I just mentioned a minute ago.
Operating expenses in Q1 on a non-GAAP basis are estimated to range from $175 million to $185 million, and this range excludes the estimated restructuring charge.
Other income is projected to range from $1 million to $2 million for the quarter, and our effective tax rate for Q1 is projected to range from 20% to 21% on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
So based on a combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q1 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.70 to $0.85 on a GAAP basis and from $0.97 to $1.12 on a non-GAAP basis.
With the launch of the iPhone 12, consumers are now able to see the benefits of Dolby Vision when they record video and share it.
This quarter, we began partnering with SoundCloud to enable artists to improve the quality of their tracks using our mastering APIs and have seen nearly 200,000 tracks mastered through our APIs in the few months since launch.
For example, now that consumers can create Dolby Vision with the iPhone 12.
