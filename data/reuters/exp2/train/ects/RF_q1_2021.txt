Based on this quarter's credit performance and the improving economic outlook, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by $142 million more than net charge-offs, while still maintaining one of the strongest allowance to loan ratios in the industry at 2.44%.
Average and ending adjusted loans declined 1% from the prior quarter.
New and renewed commercial loan production increased 5% compared to the prior quarter.
As of quarter end commercial line utilization was 39% compared to our historical average of 45%.
Just a reminder, each 1% of line utilization equates to approximately $600 million of loan growth.
Net interest income decreased 4% on a reported basis or 1% excluding the impact from day count and PPP.
PPP related NII declined $14 million from the prior quarter, as the benefits from round two were offset by slower round one forgiveness.
Two fewer days also reduced NII by $12 million.
Net interest margin declined during the quarter to 3.02%.
Cash averaged over $16 billion during the quarter.
And when combined with PPP reduced first quarter margin by 38 basis points.
Excluding excess cash and PPP, our normalized net interest margin remained stable at 3.40% evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite the near zero short term rate environment.
Cash management, mostly in the form of a December long term debt call contributed $6 million and 1 basis point of margin.
Interest bearing deposit costs fell 2 basis points in the quarter to 11 basis points contributing $4 million and 1 basis point of margin.
Loan hedges added $102 million to NII and 31 basis points to the margin.
Higher average hedge notional values drove a $3 million increase compared to the fourth quarter.
At current rate levels, we expect a little over $100 million of hedge related interest income each quarter until the hedges begin to mature in 2023.
Within the quarter, we repositioned a total of $4.3 billion of cash flow swaps and floors targeting less protection in 2023 and 2024.
Adjusted non-interest income decreased 2% from the prior quarter, but reflects a 32% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Looking ahead, we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the $55 million to $65 million range on average.
Mortgage income increased 20% over the prior quarter, driven primarily by agency gain on sale and favorable MSR valuation.
Production for the quarter was up 89% over the prior year, setting the stage for another strong year of mortgage income.
Although, we expect the impact of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth, we estimate 2021 service charges will grow compared to 2020, but remain approximately 10% to 15% below 2019 levels.
Card and ATM fees have recovered, up 10% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by increased debit card spend.
Adjusted non-interest expenses decreased 1% in the quarter, driven by lower incentive compensation, primarily related to capital markets and mortgage, which was partially offset by a seasonal increase in payroll taxes.
Of note, paid salaries were 4% lower compared to the fourth quarter, as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process.
Associate headcount decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter and 4% year-over-year.
And excluding the impact of our Ascentium Capital acquisition that closed April 1st, 2020, headcount was down 6%.
In 2021, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to remain stable compared to 2020 with quarterly adjusted non-interest expenses in the $880 million to $890 million range.
Annualized net charge-offs were 40 basis points, a three basis point improvement over the prior quarter, reflecting broad-based improvement across most portfolios.
Our allowance for credit losses declined 25 basis points to 2.44% of total loans and 280% of total non-accrual loans.
Excluding PPP loans, our allowance for credit losses was 2.57%.
The decline in the allowance reflects charge-offs previously provided for, stabilization in our economic outlook and improved credit performance, including the impact of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill approved in March.
The allowance reduction resulted in a net $142 million benefit to the provision.
Based on current expectations, we believe the peak is behind us, and we expect full year 2021 net charge-offs to range from 40 basis points to 50 basis points.
With respect to capital, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 50 basis points to an estimated 10.3% this quarter.
Based on our internal stress testing framework and amount of capital we need to run our business, we are updating our operating range for common equity Tier 1 to 9.25% to 9.75% with a goal of managing to the midpoint over time.
