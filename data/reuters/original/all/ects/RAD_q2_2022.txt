Speaker :: Trent Kruse -- Senior Vice President of Investor Relations


All right.
Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone.
We welcome you to our fiscal 2022 second-quarter earnings conference call.
On the call with me this morning are Heyward Donigan, Jim Peters and Matt Schroeder.

As we mentioned in our release, we are providing slides related to the material we will be discussing today.
These slides are provided on our website, investors.
riteaid.com.
While management will not be speaking directly to the slides, these slides are meant to facilitate your review of the company's results and to be used as a reference document following the call.
Before we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call includes certain forward-looking statements.



These forward-looking statements are presented in the context of certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ.
These risks and uncertainties are described in our press release in Item 1A of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in other documents that we file or furnish to the SEC.
Also, we will be using certain non-GAAP measures in our release and in the accompanying slides.
The definition of the non-GAAP measures, along with the reconciliation to the related GAAP measure, are described in our press release and slides.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Heyward.
Heyward?
