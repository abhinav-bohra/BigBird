Speaker :: Jennifer Samuels -- Vice President, Investor Relations


Thank you, Paul.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 question-and-answers call.
We had a fantastic quarter.
To answer your questions today, we have our president and CEO, Herb Vogel; and CFO, Wade Pursell.

Before we get started, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements and discussion of non-GAAP measures.
I direct you to Slide 2 of the accompanying slide deck, Page 6 of the accompanying earnings release, and the risk factors section of our most recently filed 10-K and 10-Q, which describe risks associated with forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ, and refer to Slides 28 through 21 of the slide deck and Pages 14 to 17 of the earnings release for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and discussion of forward-looking non-GAAP measures.
Of note, our third quarter 10-Q was filed this morning.
With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to take our first question.



Paul?
