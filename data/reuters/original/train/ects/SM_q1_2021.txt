Speaker :: Jennifer Samuels -- Vice President of Investor Relations


Thank you, Shallon.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
Before we get started, our discussion today may include forward-looking statements.
I direct you to Slide 2 of the accompanying slide deck, Page 4 of the accompanying earnings release, and the risk factors section of our most recently filed 10-K and 10-Q, which describe risks associated with forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ.

The first-quarter 10-Q was filed this morning.
We may also discuss non-GAAP measures.
Please see Slides 22 through 24 of the accompanying slide deck and Pages 11 through 14 of the accompanying earnings release for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and discussion of forward-looking non-GAAP measures.
Here to answer your questions today are president and CEO, Herb Vogel; and CFO, Wade Pursell.



I will now turn the call back to the operator to take the first question.
Shallon?
