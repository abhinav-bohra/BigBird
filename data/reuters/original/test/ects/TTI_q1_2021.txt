Speaker :: Brady Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer


Thank you, Elijio, and good morning, everyone.
And welcome to TETRA Technologies' first-quarter 2021 earnings call.
I'll summarize the highlights for the quarter and the current outlook and then turn it over to Elijio to provide information on cash flow, the balance sheet, and the impact of potentially being included in the Russell 2000.
The first quarter represents a full year of COVID-19 pandemic and its dramatic impact on the oilfield services market.

With all inventories declining and prices stabilizing at pre-pandemic levels, notwithstanding the February winter storm, it would appear the worst of the activity downturn is behind us and a market recovery is under way.
For TETRA, I'm pleased with what we've accomplished over this incredibly challenging period, including achieving critical milestones during the quarter to further position the company for recovering oil and gas market as well as accelerating our low carbon energy opportunities.
While the North America completions activity declined at a record pace last year, our differentiated offerings in our Water & Flowback segment allowed us to maintain adjusted EBITDA positive for every quarter since the pandemic started, while our industrial chemicals and international business held up exceptionally well, allowing us to improve our TETRA-only adjusted EBITDA margins in 2020 over the prior year.

market activity is well off the bottom from mid last year.
Our March double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins for water and flowback is north of 25% adjusted EBITDA margins for our completion fluids segment gives us good confidence in a strong second quarter and into the rest of the year.
Focusing on the first quarter, we achieved several key milestones, including successfully executing the deconsolidation of CSI Compressco, where we generated over $30 million of cash while retaining an 11% interest.
We reduced our term loan from $220 million to $184 million.

We achieved eight straight quarters of positive adjusted free cash flow and despite this historical February winter storm, we once again maintained positive adjusted EBITDA for our water and flowback segment.
In addition to those operational achievements, we continue to advance several of our low carbon initiatives that are currently advancing faster than what we had anticipated just 90 days ago.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $9 million, we estimated the impact of the historical winter storms during February negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $3.1 million.
Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter included $4 million of gains on the higher equity values of our holdings in CSI Compressco and Standard Lithium.

We generated $5.4 million of adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations and it was normally a challenging quarter for cash flow generation due to the first quarter payments that are traditionally made early in the year and a ramp-up in inventory for our European chemicals second-quarter peak season.
We ended the first quarter with liquidity of $81 million, despite paying down our term loan to $184 million.
Despite the softness in our international and offshore business, completion fluids and products' first-quarter revenue increased 5% sequentially, driven by increased industrial chemical sales as a result of the winter weather conditions and improving U.S. land oil and gas demand.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.4 million due to the mix of higher U.S. land oil and gas sales and lower sales for higher-margin offshore international markets.
This segment was also negatively impacted by $800,000 from the winter storms as our chemical supply chain was disrupted and many plants and operations were shut down.
Adjusted EBITDA margins for the first quarter were 23.7%, the eighth straight quarter above 20% EBITDA margins.

We exited the first quarter with adjusted EBITDA margins above 25% and expect this to continue into the second quarter.
The second quarter will also see the benefit of our seasonally high Northern Europe industrial business that has historically seen revenue increase by approximately $15 million compared to the first quarter.
We also expect stronger international and Gulf of Mexico deepwater activity from a combination of projects that were pushed from the first to the second quarter and overall higher activity levels.
At an industry conference in February, we presented a paper jointly with ExxonMobil, highlighting the success of our CS Neptune product for multiple projects that we completed for them over the recent years.

We appreciate ExxonMobil working with us to jointly present this paper, allowing both of us to highlight the benefits of environmentally friendly, zinc-free solution to complete difficult deepwater high-pressure wells.
The depressed oil prices in 2020 as a result of COVID pushed many of our targeted CS Neptune projects later into this year and 2022.
But our list of opportunities remains very encouraging and we continue to work with our customers to finalize their drilling plans and confirm that the well pressures will require CS Neptune.
For water and flowback services, first-quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA were down from the fourth quarter mainly due to the negative impacts of the weather -- the winter storm.

We estimate that the storms negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $2.3 million.
Nevertheless, our flexible cost structure allow us to remain adjusted EBITDA positive despite the disruption to our operations.
Our BlueLinx automated control system continues to be a key enabler for our integrated water management projects and has allowed us to continue to gain market share.
As activity rebounds and the need for additional field staff increases, the value of our automation will become even more important to control labor costs.

The number of integrated projects in the quarter increased from 35 in the fourth quarter of 2020 to a record-high 47 projects with 22 different customers.
Our customers realize the value of integrated projects with automation being a key component to improve efficiencies, reduce safety exposures, address environmental concerns, and to reduce the number of service providers they're managing.
Utilization of our proprietary SandStorm technology remains high.
We started taking delivery of more units in April and are deploying these units earning a quick cash payback.

We secured a second project in Argentina for a fully automated sand recovery system using the SandStorm technology.
This is an addition to the one we communicated in the fourth-quarter earnings call.
Our team has also been focused on pushing across price increases and we are seeing success in this area with a better oil price environment and increasing levels of activity in addition to our ability to consistently perform at the highest levels of efficiency and service quality in the industry, I'm pleased that our customers are recognizing that and working with us to increase prices.
March was a strong improvement from February for this segment, we achieved double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins in March and expect to be above that for the second quarter given the stronger activity levels, and from better pricing we are securing on top of continued deployment of our SandStorm technology.

With respect to our low carbon energy initiatives, we are focused on three key areas, all of which are moving ahead of schedule from what we previously anticipated.
Yesterday, we issued a press announcement entering in an MOU with CarbonFree to jointly advance a very innovative and commercially attractive carbon capture and utilization technology.
CarbonFree's patented SkyCycle technology uses calcium chloride as a key part of the conversion of CO2 to a precipitated calcium carbonate.
Precipitated calcium carbonate or PCC is a large, well-established global market and a valuable use for CO2 waste streams.

We are pleased to partner with CarbonFree and utilize our nearly 40 years of calcium chloride chemistry technical expertise and global footprint.
We believe there are many cost and commercial advantages to this technology and a source of considerable growth for TETRA.
We also have leases that cover over 30,000 acres in Arkansas with estimated bromine resources of 3.9 million tons and inferred lithium resources of 890,000 tons.
The underground sales value of these resources at today's market prices for bromine and lithium carbonate is over $18 billion and since both minerals play an important role in the world's electrification and energy storage, demand outlook is very promising.

The majority of our lithium resources are through our relationship with Standard Lithium, which continues to advance its solution as one of the key U.S. sources of high-quality lithium carbonate.
Consistent with our contractual arrangement, we received an additional 400,000 shares of Standard Lithium in April.
In the first quarter, we also made great progress, qualifying our PureFlow, the brand name for our high-purity zinc bromide with multiple energy storage companies that use zinc bromide as a key part of their electrolyte in their battery technology.

We are currently in commercial discussions with these companies and expect first revenue for this new application in 2021 well ahead of our prior estimates.
As these technologies commercialize, this will create a completely new market for us, and demands for our zinc bromide can be very meaningful.
As we intend with CarbonFree for carbon capture, we are looking to work with these energy storage technology companies and to use our deep chemistry expertise in a more collaborative way.
So in addition to our Water & Flowback businesses now showing signs of a steady recovery, along with a strong position we have in the offshore Completion Fluids market with the CS Neptune upside and the predictably consistent performance of our industrial chemicals business, all of which consistently generate positive EBITDA and free cash flow, we're in advanced stages with 3 significant areas to capitalize on low carbon energy opportunities that can be transformational for TETRA.

As we have all these opportunities, we were very open with our investor base on the progress of each.
In the meantime, we will continue to execute and deliver free cash flow from our two segments and continue to delever.
And I'll turn it over to Elijio for some additional color, then we'll open up for questions.





Speaker :: Elijio Serrano -- Chief Financial Officer


Thank you, Brady.
I'll make a couple of statements first on the presentation of our financial statements then talk about some balance sheet items.
As mentioned on the last earnings call on February 25, with the sale of the general partnership and the incentive distribution rights, and the 11 million common units of CSI Compressco on January 29, our balance sheet now completely excludes CSI Compressco.
The income statement reflects the result of CSI Compressco as discontinued operations for the January 2021 and prior period.

The cash flow statement for the first quarter includes the 29 days in January that we were still the general partner.
When we report adjusted free cash flow for TETRA, we've excluded the first 29 days of January for CSI Compressco from our free cash flow.
Income from discontinued operations include $121 million gain on the CSI Compressco deconsolidation transaction.
The vast majority of this is a non-cash gain as the transaction resulted in the recapture of our carrying basis in CSI Compressco, given that we received over $150 million of distributions from Compressco and CSI Compressco, since we took them public in 2011.

As those distributions were received over the past 10 years that we were the general partner, the carrying value of our investment in CSI Compressco was reduced and therefore the transaction resulted in a recapture of the carrying value.
The transaction did not result in a taxable gain to TETRA.
Into March 2021, TETRA continues to have a tax loss carryforward that will allow us to offset future U.S. pre-tax income by approximately $380 million.

And as the economy recovers and we go back to generating taxable income in the United States, we do not expect to be paying U.S. Federal income taxes for a while.
Then with respect to our results in the first quarter, we incurred $6.6 million of non-recurring charges.
These charges included $2.9 million related to a cumulative adjustment for long-term compensation that was the result of the significant increase that we saw in our stock price in the first quarter, also includes $2.4 million of transaction and other expenses, mainly related to the CSI Compressco deconsolidation, $0.5 million of stock appreciation right expense, $300,000 of restructuring costs and $300,000 of stock warrant fair value adjustment expense.

Those were the unusual items in the quarter.
Our first quarter companywide SG&A cost adjusted for unusual items was down 2% sequentially, compared to the 2% increase in revenue and was 23% lower than a year ago.
Our first-quarter results also included a $4 million gain on the mark-to-market adjustments to the 11% ownership that we have on CSI Compressco and to the 1% ownership or 1.2 million shares that we own of Standard Lithium.
We will continue to see mark-to-market adjustments for the equity we own of these two publicly traded entities.

We reduced net debt from $133 million at the end of 2020 to $117 million at the end of the first quarter.
Nothing currently remains outstanding on our ABL revolver.
First-quarter adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations was $5.4 million, almost $1 million above the first quarter of the year ago.
We achieved this first-quarter free cash flow despite paying the CSI Compressco transaction expenses and the typical first of the year payments for insurance, property taxes, year-end bonuses, and so on.

As a result of last year's streak -- strong free cash flow of $59 million and this year's first-quarter free cash flow plus the proceeds we received in the CSI Compressco transactions, we have reduced our term loan from $220 million at September 30, 2020, to $184 million at the end of March 2021.
The $36 million reduction in the term loan will save us $2.6 million of interest expense on an annual basis.
And as a reminder, our term loan does not mature until the year 2025.
We expect second-quarter profitability to be up sequentially for all our segments, driven by increased oil prices driving the activity in the United States and international markets.

The seasonality of our Northern Europe industrial chemicals business, where we typically see about a $15 million, 1-5, sequential increase in revenue and the price increases we are getting in addition to continued deployment of our SandStorm technology.
We remain focused on streamlining the organization and generating free cash flow to further reduce outstanding debt.
Last item I'll mention is the Russell 2000.
I previously mentioned that the decline in our share price last year resulted in TETRA being dropped from the Russell 2000.

When we were dropped in the Russell 2000, we saw lot of passive index-based funds exit their position in TETRA, putting even further downward pressure on our stock last year.
The Russell 2000 has reconstituted every June.
We believe that the cut-off to be part of the Russell 2000 this year will be somewhere between 265 and $270 million.
Our market cap as of the close of business yesterday was $315 million.

This Friday is the first listing of the companies that might be part of the Russell 2000, which has been updated every Friday in June.
The final listing is on June 25.
If TETRA is added back to the Russell 2000, there is a possibility that we will be seeing passive index-based funds adding TETRA back to their portfolio as many mimic their holdings to match the Russell 2000.
If that is to occur, there is a potential to see strong demand for TETRA shares in May and into June, hopefully having a high -- a nice impact to our share price.

I encourage you to visit the Russell 2000 website for updates.
I also encourage you to read our news press release that we issued today for all the supporting details and additional financial and operational metrics.
Additionally, we will file our 10-Q with the SEC before the end of the day today.
Chad, with that, we will now open it up to questions.
