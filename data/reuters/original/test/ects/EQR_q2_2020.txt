Speaker :: Mark J. Parrell -- President and Chief Executive Officer


Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today.
During one of the most challenging periods in our country and industry's history.
We feel that our business showed considerable resiliency.

We continue to be pleased with the financial strength of our customer base, with our average annual household incomes of $164,000.
Data suggests that only 4% of workers making more than $150,000 a year, have recently lost their jobs, compared to the low-teens for lower income categories.
We have collected about 97% of our residential rents during the second quarter and attribute this to a customer base that remains well-employed and capable of meeting their obligations, July is trending similarly.

We also demonstrated strong expense results, while the pandemic both added and subtracted costs from our operations, the innovations around leasing and service that we described in prior calls have really taken hold and we expect a durable reduction in our expense growth rate even after COVID is in the rear view mirror.
And while our 90 basis point decline in same store residential revenue was our first quarterly revenue decline in 10 years, our residential business held up reasonably well under very trying circumstances.
We also believe that we have stabilized our physical occupancy at 95%.

In a moment, Michael will give you some color on what is going on in each of our markets and Bob will address our expenses, non-residential operations, and balance sheet.
And then we will welcome your questions.

But before I turn it over, I want to highlight a couple of things.
First in the quarter, we stabilized two development properties, one in Cambridge, Massachusetts and another in Seattle, Washington.
The Cambridge asset is a 64-unit property, adjacent to an existing asset of ours and was built for $47 million and stabilize at approximately 5% yield on cost.
This property complements our large existing Cambridge portfolio of six properties with about a 1,100 units and is ideally suited to house the biotech employees working in that area.
The other property consists of 137 units and is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle and cost $65 million to build.
It stabilized at about a 5% yield on cost.

In terms of transactions, we're pleased to close on two dispositions during the quarter and have sold more than $750 million in assets during 2020.
We feel that we received strong pricing on this quarter sales, as both sold assets were over 50 years old and our combined disposition yield was 4.4%.
But we note that these sales were priced prior to the pandemic and so shouldn't be seen as a look through on current pricing.
We have not acquired anything this year, but we like to think of ourselves as professional opportunists and have a balance sheet that as strong as it has ever been, which will allow us to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves.

And now, a bit about our capital allocation strategy.
We have spoken on prior calls about the company broadening its portfolio by expanding into, Denver and into the dense suburbs of our markets.
For the last few years, we've been actively pruning our exposure in some urban locations, including Manhattan and buying more dense suburban assets.
Our current portfolio mix stands at about 55% urban and 45% suburban.
We will continue to build and buy apartments in locations both urban and dense suburban, where affluent renters wish to live and in markets where we feel long-term returns will be maximized.

We believe that our strategy is sufficiently flexible to retain high-quality urban properties, while adding some breath of the portfolio over time, so we can continue to produce a reliable and growing stream of income for our shareholders.

And now, I will turn the call over to Michael Manelis.





Speaker :: Michael L. Manelis -- Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer


Thanks, Mark.
Let me start by acknowledging the dedication and hard work of our employees during the second quarter.
Despite very challenging operating conditions, the team was able to focus on the health and safety of their fellow employees and our residents by implementing our new operating standards to address COVID concerns.
These heightened cleanliness standards have been well received by residents and prospects.

The team elevated their voices in various listening sessions held throughout our organization to share how they were navigating and managing stress due to the unrest in our country.
Their voices will help us continue to cultivate a culture of inclusion at Equity Residential.
They stayed on top of delinquency by executing a consistent and transparent process that emphasize frequent communication with residents who are financially impacted by the virus.

Our collection rate remained strong and fairly stable throughout the quarter, with a little over 97% being collected.
They focused on retaining existing residents, as evidenced by turnover at 11.8% for the quarter, which is a 130 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019.
This was driven by a 10% reduction in move-outs during the quarter as more residents opted to stay in place.

Achieved renewal rate increases were positive 70 basis points for the quarter, but we expect this number to trend lower as negotiations become more challenging.
Right now about 20% of our renewal offers for July and August include a slight market rate increase.
The team also adopted new technologies for both sales and service that allowed us to meet the needs of our customers, while creating operating efficiencies, which contributed to the low growth in our operating expenses.

As to occupancy, we stated on the last call that we expected the occupancy impact to be the most pronounced in the second quarter, setting a new base from which we've hoped we would improve as shelter in place orders were lifted, that so far appears to be the case.
The portfolio was 95% occupied today and we average 94.9% through the quarter after recovering from a 94.2% low point in mid-May.

On the rate side, since last week in May, base rents have been relatively stable, but this is bit of a bifurcated story.
pricing remains challenged in the urban cores of New York, the city of Boston and Downtown, San Francisco, which represents about one quarter of our portfolio.
The rest of the portfolio is showing more price stability.
The rents are still lower than last year.
New lease change was down 7% this quarter for our same store portfolio, before concessions.
New lease concessions during the quarter were heavily concentrated in the urban cores of New York, San Francisco and Boston.
factoring in concessions, the net effective new lease change for the portfolio during the quarter was down 9%.

Overall, traffic and application activity improved throughout the quarter as net effective prices were being lowered.
As we mentioned on last quarter's call application activity was recovering at the end of April and continued to do so through the remainder of the quarter.
By late May and into June, we are seeing somewhat higher new applications week-over-week relative to the same periods in 2019.
This improvement, however, was not sufficient to make up for the nearly 40% year-over-year reduction experienced in April.
As a result, the total number of move-ins for the second quarter were 20% below the second quarter of 2019.

At present, we think it is helpful to split our portfolio into three pieces, as we think about our forward operating performance.
First, our suburban assets, which represents approximately 45% of the company's portfolio, have been more resilient during the pandemic with occupancy declining to a low point of 95.2% before recovering fully to levels at or above prior year and ending the quarter at t 96.6%.
Suburban renewal percent was very strong at 65% and continues to trend well above prior year.
Rates have been slowly recovering since early May and there have been very limited concessions used in this portfolio.

Second, our urban assets that are located in the city of Boston and Cambridge, Manhattan and Brooklyn and Downtown, San Francisco, which represents about 25% of the company's portfolio and is currently 91% occupied.
As stated earlier, this portfolio has the highest use of concessions and the most rate pressure.

For the quarter, this urban portfolio renewed 58% of residents, which is 500 basis points lower than Q2 of 2019 and was trending down throughout the quarter ending at 53% in June.
The urban cores in Boston, New York and San Francisco, have the highest risk of volatility in operations for the balance of the year.

Our third grouping consist of urban assets and other markets, like Washington D.C., Seattle and Southern California and consist of about 30% of our portfolio.
These assets reached the low point in occupancy of 94% in mid-May, but quickly bounce back and remained at 95.2%.
Pricing has been stable since the middle of May with rates being down year-over-year and concessions being used on about 15% of our applications.

During the quarter, 57% of residents renewed from these assets, which is 300 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019.
Overall, this group of urban assets has had consistent operations for the past two months, with a slight uptick in occupancy in the past couple of weeks.

Let me provide some quick color on the markets.
Starting with Boston, the urban center of Boston and Cambridge represent about three quarters of our total Boston portfolio and were more impacted by early termination in non-renewals from international students and third party corporate providers, while neither one of these represent a significant amount of total units, the impact was concentrated.
The Boston urban center is now 91.5% occupied and continues to be pressured on rates and occupancy, especially given the uncertainty around international students and the competitive supply being delivered.

The other submarkets in Boston have been operating at 95% with consistent rates and very little concession use.
Overall applications have been running at or above prior year for the entire market as we see good demand for our product.
We continue to like this market, long-term due to its combination of bio, education and technology jobs and the high quality of lifestyle.

Washington, D.C. continues to demonstrate some resilience.
Although, the market has not escape pricing pressure.
Absorption of new supply continues and the use of concessions remain extremely limited in our portfolio.
Applications have been running at prior year levels and the portfolio is 95.8% occupied.

Moving on to New York, which continues to be one of our most challenging markets.
Leasing traffic and application volume returned to 2019 levels by mid-May but at reduced rental rates and higher levels of concessions.
The leasing traffic in the city is heavily centered around local bargain hunters, who are moving within the market and searching for a deal.
Concession use is widespread with about 50% of our applications receiving concessions, which now average greater than one month.

While the application count has recovered to prior year levels, this was not enough to make up for the deficit created by the lack of volume in April.
Retention started strong in the quarter, but has since moderated.
During June, we renewed 57% of our renewal offered, which is strong by all accounts, but lower than June of 2019.
Our assets on the Hudson Waterfront, New Jersey, which is about a quarter of our New York exposure have performed better than Manhattan and Brooklyn.
We have held 95% occupancy on the Waterfront for the past month and while concessions are being used, it's at a lower level than in Manhattan.

Our New York same store portfolio, including New Jersey is about 92% occupied today.
Recovery in Manhattan and Brooklyn will take some time, but if office reopenings begin in early 2021 as currently expected and the city continues to show good progress on controlling the virus, we may see higher than usual demand later this year and early next year during a period when demand is typically seasonally soft.

Heading over to the West Coast, Seattle delivered the strongest revenue results in the quarter, both in terms of absolute revenue growth and the combined impact of new lease change and renewals.
The portfolio is 95.3% occupied today and overall revenue performance has been very consistent since early April, although, pricing decelerated slightly through what normally is the growth period of peak leasing season.

We have not seen big layoffs in tech jobs in the market, but we are keeping an eye on employers like Amazon, who last week announced that they were extending their corporate office employees working from home until early January and have delayed new hire start dates from August into September, October.
Overall, this trend may cause some short-term pressure on demand and occupancy, but could also provide a boost to the fourth quarter, which typically slows down.

San Francisco's revenue performance is very different depending on the submarket, most notably, between urban and suburban.
Our portfolio in this market is approximately 30% urban and 70% suburban.
In the city of San Francisco, we are seeing declining rents that are presently well into the double-digits year-over-year and represents the largest year-over-year decline in our entire portfolio.
The city also has widespread concession use at or above four weeks and has experienced the biggest impact from start-up layoffs and the lack of foreign immigration.

Our suburban portfolio located in the Peninsula, South Bay and East Bay as well as the few urban assets that we have in those submarkets stabilized in early May.
While rates are down on a year-over-year basis here, they have been holding in place for over a month with very limited use of concessions.

The South Bay is still at risk as new supply enters that submarket at a time when the large tech companies have slowed growth and are trying to figure out longer-term work from home policies.
That said, the San Francisco Bay Area remains a great place to live, tech companies remain a strong high wage job growth engine and the long-term outlook remains positive.

Heading to to Southern California, overall pricing is down in L.A., but very stable through June with very little concession used in our portfolio.
L.A. is 96.1% occupied today, West L.A. remains the most challenged submarket, but even here occupancy recovered to 94.1% and the Downtown submarket, which currently has supply pressure has been stable at 95%, although rent declines are the most pronounced in this submarket.

Overall, we are seeing strength in the suburban submarkets of L.A., which is about 45% of our L.A. portfolio.
This strength is mitigating the rate and occupancy declines in Downtown, Hollywood, Mid-Wilshire in West LA.
While the high levels of competitive supply being delivered in the second half of the year, recent spike in COVID cases and the reversal a phased opening plans for the market are certainly potential short term negatives.
But content creation and technology job story in this large, diverse market remains positive.
We think jobs in L.A. have the potential to grow even more strongly coming out of the pandemic in order to meet the increasing demand for new online content.

Finally, Orange County and San Diego are both performing well with occupancy above prior year and very limited downward pressure on rates.
These are beyond challenging times, but our business is demonstrating resilience and our teams have shown that they can deliver.

At this point, I will turn the call over to Bob.





Speaker :: Robert A. Garechana -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer


Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone.
Today, I will make a couple of brief remarks on same store expenses, delinquency and bad debt, and conclude with the balance sheet.

Same store expenses declined for the quarter relative to prior year driven by the advancements in our technology initiatives that Michael mentioned and delay or deferral of certain expenses largely stemming from the pandemic.
Page 16 of the release provides detailed color on specific line items.
I do want to highlight that expenses in the quarter included approximately $1 million related to one-time bonuses for our frontline workers and another $500,000 from elevated cleaning and other health and safety costs.

As evidenced by our strong 97% collection rate for the quarter, our high-quality resident continues to pay their rent.
That said, the combination of the small percentage of our residents that have been financially impacted by the pandemic and our conservative accounting policy has led to elevated residential bad debt in the quarter.

Residential bad debt reduced revenue growth by approximately $9 million or 150 basis points in the same store portfolio.
That is about 100 basis points higher than the comparable period in 2019, which would have been a more typical level.
For the next quarter or so, economic and regulatory uncertainties may lead to continued elevated bad debt.

Turning to our non-residential business, I would remind you that the non-residential business is a small part of our overall operations at approximately 4% of revenues, historically.
But it is likely to have a disproportionate impact on total same store performance for the next few quarters.

Retail tenant collections were about 60% for the quarter with collections trending slightly higher in June.
Uncollected amounts that were deferred were almost entirely reserved against during the quarter from the financial statement standpoint.
About two-thirds of the decline in non-residential revenues quarter-over-quarter stemmed from these reserves and other bad debt related items.

Much like in residential, we have applied a relatively conservative accounting policy.
This business is likely to continue to face challenges and we expect that the third quarter could be even tougher given likely delays in reopening activity and the potential lack of additional government small business stimulus.
If retail performance continues to be stressed, we expect that a significant portion of the straight line non-residential receivable disclosed on Page 11, could be at risk and therefore, could be written off.

Finally, a quick highlight on our fortress-like balance sheet.
We enter the pandemic from a position of strength and have further enhanced our position through thoughtful refinancing activity and incremental debt reduction from disposition proceeds.
By taking these steps, we have ensured sufficient liquidity and incremental debt capacity for any opportunities that may present themselves.
We have limited near-term maturities, modest development spend, and incredible access to capital.

With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark.





Speaker :: Mark J. Parrell -- President and Chief Executive Officer


Thanks, Bob.
And a final note, while we fully acknowledge that the next few quarters will be difficult, the cities in which we operate have shown great resilience over time and while some of them are certainly challenged today, we believe that they will bounce back when we reach the other side of this pandemic.

We expect that these cities will remain at the center of the knowledge-based economy and will continue to attract high income renters.
We think that the obituaries for the great urban centers have been written much too prematurely.
The world's great cities have continued to adapt and thrive over time and they will do so again.
We appreciate the continued support we have received from the investment community, as we navigate the current storms and look forward to coming out of this pandemic well-positioned for long-term growth.

Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for the Q&A session.
