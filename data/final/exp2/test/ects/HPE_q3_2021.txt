Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter and in line with normal sequential seasonality, also in line with our outlook that factored in some of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged.
I am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior-year period.
We also booked two one-time charging totally $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud involving a channel partner in APJ.
Even with these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit.
As a result, we now expect other income and expense for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately $50 million.
With strong execution across the business and despite two unanticipated one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3.
Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $526 million.
This puts us at a record $1.5 billion of year-to-date free cash flow, up $1.1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in operating profit.
We paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October.

We remain on track to deliver on our full-year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%.
In compute, revenue grew 4% quarter over quarter, reflecting normal sequential seasonality despite previously anticipated supply chain tightness.
Operating margins of 11.2%, were up 190 basis points from the prior year, due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment.
Within Storage, revenue grew 1% year over year and 3% quarter over quarter, ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings.
Nimble grew 10% year over year, with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year over year.
All-Flash Arrays grew by over 30% year over year, led by Primera.
The mix shift toward more software-rich platforms helped drive Storage operating margins to 15.1%, up 10 basis points year over year, offset by continued investments in our cloud data services.
While our bad debt loss ratio did increase slightly to 94 basis points this quarter, it was entirely due to a one-time $11 million reserve charge related to the already mentioned likely fraud in APJ by a channel partner.
Absent this one-off event, our bad debt loss ratio would have improved to just 61 basis points aligned to pre-pandemic levels.
Our operating margin was 11.1%, up 300 basis points from the prior year.
And our return on equity at 18.3%, is well above the 15% plus target set at SAM.

For Q3 specifically, our ARR was $705 million, which was up 33% year over year as reported, and total as-a-Service orders were up 46% year over year.
Overall, based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing toward achieving our ARR growth target of 30% to 40% CAGR from FY '20 to FY '23.
And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP earnings per share in Q3 by 31% year over year.
We delivered another record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q3 of 34.7% of revenues, which was up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior year.

Excluding these one-off charges, our operating margin would have been 10.2%.

We expect increased financial services volume that includes more than $150 million in Q4 financing for a very large deal that is predominantly GreenLake and will benefit our ARR margins for years to come.
Furthermore, we made additional progress during the quarter, securitizing over $750 million of financial services-related debt through the ABS market.
We now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96.
And you can see our efforts in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year to date that also reflects the strengthening demand environment and a substantial order book we have across the business.
For Q4 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 to $0.52.
Additionally, given our record levels of free cash flow year to date and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, that is a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.
We are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21, and we'll update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October.
