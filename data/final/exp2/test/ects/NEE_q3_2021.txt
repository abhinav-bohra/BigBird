NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 12% year-over-year.
At FPL, net income increased approximately 10% versus the prior-year comparable period, reflecting contributions from continued investment in the business.
FPL's major capital initiatives continue to progress well, including what will be the world's largest integrated solar power battery system, the 409-megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center that is now 75% complete and on track to begin serving customers later this year.
Gulf Power's year-to-date net income contribution increased approximately 14% versus the prior-year comparable period.
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings for the quarter increased by approximately 12% year-over-year.
Our development team had another terrific quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2,160 megawatt to our backlog since the last earnings call, marking the best quarter of overall origination and the best quarter of new wind additions in Energy Resources' history.
These backlog additions include approximately 225 megawatts of combined solar and storage projects and a 500 megawatt wind project that is intended to power an adjacent new green hydrogen facility, which I'll provide some additional details on in just a few minutes.
For the third quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $836 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $79 million and $0.04 per share, respectively year-over-year.
Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.5% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's year-over-year net income growth of approximately 10%.
FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion.
Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended September 2021.
During the quarter, we restored $124 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of $597 million.
As you know, much of the East Coast of the US was recently impacted by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall on the Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane and also caused catastrophic flooding across the Northeastern US.
As part of our assistance efforts, we sent more than 1,250 of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment and other supplies to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2021 net income of $91 million or $0.05 per share.
During the quarter, Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 13% year-over-year.
Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $200 million during the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to be roughly $800 million.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect Gulf Power's regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%.
Gulf Power anticipates bringing approximately 150 megawatts of cost effective zero emission solar capacity online within the next six months.
Through a restoration workforce of roughly 1,700 personnel, Gulf Power was able to restore its service to essentially all of the approximately 20,000 customers impacted by Fred in Northwest Florida in less than 24 hours.
Moreover, the average customer outage was restored in less than 2 hours.
Florida's labor force participation rate has recovered to its highest level in nearly 18 months reflecting the ongoing recovery, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
The real estate sector in Florida also continues to grow with a three-month average new housing starts up over 40% year-over-year.
In August alone, there are -- there were twice as many new housing starts in Florida than in the average over the last 10 years.
Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, are up 47% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 32%.
As another indicator of Florida's economic health, Florida's retail sales index is up nearly 60% versus the prior year.
During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 77,500 or 1.5% from the comparable year prior quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth.
FPL's third quarter retail sales decreased 1.4% from the prior-year comparable period.
A decline in weather related usage per customer of approximately 2.7% offset the benefits of customer growth.
On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably.
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.6% versus the comparable prior-year quarter.
And Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales increased 0.6% year-over-year with strong usage from increased customer growth contributing favorably.
The four-year proposed agreement, which begins on January 2022 provides for retail base revenue adjustments as shown on the accompanying slide and allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.6% with a range of 9.7% to 11.7%, and no change to FPL's equity ratio from investor sources for the combined system.
Should the average 30-year US Treasury yields be 2.49% or greater over any consecutive six-month period during the term of the agreement, Florida Power & Light's allowed regulatory ROE would increase to 10.8% with a range of 9.8% to 11.8%.
The proposed agreement also includes flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus.
Additionally, the proposed settlement agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations of up to 894 megawatts annually of new solar generation in each of 2024 and 2025, subject to a cost cap of $1,250 per kilowatt and showing an overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers.
FPL would also be authorized to expand its SolarTogether voluntary community solar program by constructing an additional 1,788 megawatts of solar generation through 2025, which would more than double the size of our current SolarTogether program and is expected to save our customers millions of dollars over the lifetime of the assets.
This innovative technology could one day unlock 100% carbon-free electricity that's available 24 hours a day.
The proposed settlement agreement also introduces several electric vehicle programs and pilots designed to accelerate the growth of electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure investment across Florida with a total capital investment of more than $200 million.
Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hour of usage on residential bills in the first 12 months of cost recovery.
If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge.
FPL's typical resident bill is lower today than it was 15 years ago and is well below the national average.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $428 million or $0.22 per share.
Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $619 million or $0.31 per share, which is an increase of $68 million and $0.03 per share, respectively year-over-year.
Contributions from new investments added $0.03 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program.
The contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share year-over-year.
Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.02 higher year-over-year due to favorable market conditions in our retail supply and power marketing businesses.
All other impacts decreased results by $0.03 per share versus 2020, driven primarily by miscellaneous tax items.
As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources' development team had a record quarter of origination success, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog.
Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 1,240 megawatts of new wind projects, 515 megawatts of new solar projects and 345 megawatts of new storage assets to our renewables and storage backlog.
In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources' share of NextEra Energy Partners' planned acquisition of an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind project that the partnership is announcing today.
Through the three -- first three quarters of 2021, we have added more than 5,700 megawatts to our renewables and storage backlog.
Energy Resources' backlog of signed contracts now stands at approximately 18,100 megawatts.
At this early stage, we have made terrific progress toward our long-term development expectations with more than 7,600 megawatts of projects already in our post 2022 backlog.
Our backlog additions for the third quarter include a 500 megawatt wind project, the majority of which is contracted with a hydrogen fuel cell company.
The project's customer intends to construct a nearby hydrogen electrolyzer facility that will use the wind energy production to supply up to 100% of the facility's load requirements.
Energy Resources also add nearly 300 megawatts of battery storage projects in California, and we continue to experience significant demand from California based utilities and commercial and industrial customers for reliable energy storage solutions.
We are currently developing nearly 2,400 megawatts of additional co-located and stand-alone battery storage projects in California with the potential to be deployed in 2023 and 2024, to enhance reliability and help meet the state's energy storage capacity requirements and ambitious clean energy goals.
More than 30 years, we have been investing in clean energy in California and are proud to help the state lead the country to a carbon-free sustainable future.
While the roughly $45 million total equity investment for these transactions is small in context of our overall capital program, we are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward.
For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $447 million or $0.23 per share.
NextEra Energy's 2021 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share were $1.48 billion and $0.75 per share, respectively.
Adjusted results from corporate and other segment increased by $0.01 year-over-year.
For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.54 and we would be disappointed not to be at or near the high-end of this range.
These initiatives could generate negative adjusted earnings per share impacts of as much as $0.08 to $0.10 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.
Looking further ahead, for 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of these ranges in 2022 and 2023.
We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base.
Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.685 per common unit or $2.74 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top-end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range.
Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 265% since the IPO.
Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners closed on its previously announced acquisitions of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects from a third party and approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from Energy Resources.
In addition, today, we are announcing an agreement to acquire an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind asset in California from a third party to further expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and enhance its long-term growth visibility.
NextEra Energy Partners intends to purchase the asset for a total consideration of approximately $280 million, subject to closing adjustments, which includes the assumption of approximately $150 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing.
We expect to fund the approximately $130 million balance of the purchase price using existing debt capacity.
Following the project debt paydown next year, the asset is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and unlevered cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on a five-year average run rate -- annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2022.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $334 million, up approximately 7% from the prior year comparable quarter due to growth in the underlying portfolio.
New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 and the recently closed acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind assets from a third party, contributed $23 million.
Existing assets contributed $7 million, primarily driven by the wind repowerings that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year and an improvement in wind resource.
Wind resource for the third quarter was 101% of the long-term average versus 96% in the third quarter of 2020.
Cash available for distribution of $158 million for the third quarter declined by $4 million versus the prior year, primarily as a result of lower year-over-year PAYGO payments after a weaker wind resource period in the second quarter of this year.
On a year-to-date basis versus 2020, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 6%, respectively.
We continue to expect NextEra Energy Partners portfolio to support an annualized rate of fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024.
NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively.
We expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range.
By year-end 2022, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $675 million to $765 million.
At the midpoint, these revised expectations ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 13%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2021 run rate expectations.
And in particular, it will now evaluate NextEra Energy Partners debt metrics on a funds from operations or FFO to debt basis with a downgrade threshold of 14% instead of a debt-to-EBITDA basis.
