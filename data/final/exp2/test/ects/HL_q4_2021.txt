Hecla has the United States largest reserve of any mining company and produces more than 40% of all the silver mined here.
Our third message is that on the ESG front, Hecla stands out with the safety record of our employees that is 40% below the national average, and we are also net neutral on greenhouse gas emissions for Scope 1 and 2 because we have among the smallest emissions in our industry.
Now we mined 86% of our tons last year with the UCB method, but we we didn't speak about this until almost the end of the year because we wanted to make sure we understood how the cycle worked, confirmed how it would improve our seismicity management, determine how we manage dilution, and consider the impacts on the workforce.
And it clearly works with the UCB method contributing to the 75% increase in the lucky Friday silver production over 2020.
And 2022's silver production is expected to be 20% increase over 2021, and we'll have even more growth in '23 as the mine becomes a consistent 5 million ounce producer.
Now, the Lucky Friday has been around for 80 years, but this new mining method fundamentally changes this long standing mine.
Well, if you look at the history of the mine, Lucky Friday has never had sustained production about 2.5 million ounces.
Now adding a strong Lucky Friday in 2021 led to a record financial year with revenues of $807 million and adjusted EBITDA of $279 million.
Cash flow from operations was $221 million and free cash flow was $111 million, and those were the second highest in our history.
This and last year's performance has allowed Hecla to generate in excess of $200 million in free cash flow over the past two years and further enhance our common stock dividend policy by lowering the realized silver price threshold to $20 per ounce.
So as a result of this, about 20% of our free cash flow went to shareholders last year.
We spent a little less than $50 million as drilling -- we were able to resume our drilling and our operations in sites after the slowdown that we had in 2020 due to COVID-19.
So as a result of that, our silver reserves increased 6% over last year, and they're now the second highest in our history at 200 million ounces, with Greens Creek's reserves at 125 million ounces.
And it's -- that's its highest since 2002, and it's an increase of about 12% over 2020.
The chart on the left shows not only that we replaced mining depletion, but also converted 26 million ounces of resource to reserves.
Now, our gold reserves at the end of 2021 were 2.7 million ounces.
However, we did increase our silver inferred resources by 8% to 490 million ounces, with increases at Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, and San Sebastian.
And in those reports, there's an economic analysis that's in Section 19 that shows very strong economics of the reserves.
And what it does is it assumes that the inferred resources that we mine, which is about 5% to 15% of what we typically mine at those two mines, that that was waste.
And so what we've also done is we've included in Section 21 the summarized information, the supplemental information that gives our long-term plans that includes this inferred materials at their expected grade.
And so I'd encourage you to look at Section 21 as Section 19.
Turning to Slide 7, as Phil noted earlier, we generated record revenue of more than $800 million, of which silver contributed 34% while gold contributed 42%.
Each of our operations contributed significantly to our revenue, led by Greens Creek at about 50%, Casa Berardi at 30%, and Lucky Friday at 16%.
Record revenues, coupled with high margins, generated record adjusted EBITDA for the year of $279 million, resulting in our leverage ratio being 1.1 times, which is significantly below our target of two times.
Our cash flow from operations at $221 million and free cash flow of $111 million were the second highest.
As a result of our consistent and strong operational performance, our balance sheet has continued to strengthen as we entered the year with $210 million in cash and excess of $440 million of liquidity.
As you look on Slide 8, we don't have any planned large capital expenditures as our capital ranges from a low of $91 million in 2020 to what we anticipate spending in 2022 of $135 million.
In 2021, our total capital and production costs were approximately $480 million, split approximately $370 million as production cost and $109 million for capital.
Our 2022 total expected spend on production costs is about 6% higher than 2021.
A 5% inflation factor would add less than $7 million to the total capital spend.
You can see all our minds generate positive free cash flow, and companywide, we generated more than 110 million in free cash flow during 2021, which was the second highest in the company's history.
With this strong and consistent free cash flow generation, we've seen an increase to our cash balance of 60% over 2020 and more than three times that of 2019.
Greens Creek had another strong year as the mine produced 9.2 million ounces at an all-in sustaining costs of $3.19 per ounce, which was below our lower end of guidance at $3.25 per silver ounce.
The 2021 realized silver margin at the mine was approximately $22 per ounce, an increase of 75% over 2020.
In 2021, Greens Creek generated $185 million in free cash flow and over the past three years has generated more than $445 million in free cash flow.
In addition to the strong operational and financial performance, we increase reserves by 12%, and at 125 million ounces, the reserves are the second highest since 2002.
Silver production guidance for 2022 is 8.6 million to 8.9 million ounces as we will be mining lower grades for the production sequence.
Silver cash costs are expected to be in the range of seventy $0.75 to $2.50 per ounce while the silver all-in sustaining cost guidance is $6.50 to $8.50 per ounce.
Lucky Friday has 75 million ounces in silver reserves, which translates to a reserve mine life plan of 17 years.
The Lucky Friday mine produced 3.6 million ounces of silver in 2021 with almost one million ounces produced in the fourth quarter.
In 2021, production was a 75% increase over 2020.
All-in sustaining costs for the year were $14.34 per ounce in line with our guidance.
The mine generated $32.7 million in free cash flow for the year with 86% of the tons mined using the UCB method.
The mine is expected to produce 4.3 million to 4.6 million ounces of silver in 2022 and cash costs of $0.75 to $2 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs of $7.25 to $9.25 per ounce.
Production in 2022 is planned to be almost 20% greater than 2021 while the all in sustaining cost per ounce is expected to decline by more than 30% due to higher production and byproduct credits.
Turning to Slides 13 and 14, the UCB mining method is a new productive mining method developed by Hecla in an effort to proactively control fault slip seismicity in deep, high stress narrow-vein mining.
Large blasts using up to 3,500 pounds of a pumped emulsion and programable electronic detonators fragment up to 350 feet of strike length to a depth of approximately 30 feet.
Moving to Slide 15, the Casa Berardi mine achieved record throughput as the mill achieved 4,187 tons per day in 2021.
For the year, the mine produced 134.5 thousand ounces of gold at cash costs of $1,125 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,399 per ounce while generating free cash flow of $13.7 million.
From 2019 to 2021, the mine has generated more than $100 million in free cash flow.
For 2022, our production guidance for the mine is 125,000 to 132,000 ounces at cash costs of $1,175 to $1,325 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,450 to $1,600 per ounce.
Of note is a 16% increase in reserves at the mine to 1.8 million ounces, mainly attributable to additions at the 160 pit.
With these reserves, Casa Berardi has a reserve mine plan of 14 years.
So we're going to remain a very low cost silver producer with our all-in sustaining cost guidance being $9.75 to $11.75.
On gold, we're guiding to a sic of $14.50 to $1,600 per ounce and we're going to continue to work to improve the operations at Casa and deal with the inflationary pressure that we see in the Abitibi.
Looking to capital, we anticipate spending approximately $135 million, as Russell mentioned, which is slightly higher than previous years.
Cost and capital assumptions include costs associated with managing COVID and assume 5% inflation.
We also anticipate spending 45 million for exploration and pre-development of that.
that host more than 300 million ounces of silver and 3 billion pounds of copper.
