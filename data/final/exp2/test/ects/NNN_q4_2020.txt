As I've said before, perhaps the best word to describe National Retail Properties is consistent: consistent investment focus on single-tenant retail properties; consistency of people and culture; consistently raising the dividend for 31 consecutive years; consistent conservative balance sheet philosophy that maintains flexibility and dry powder; consistent long-term tenant relationships.
Highlights for National Retail Properties in 2020 include: increasing the common stock dividend for the 31st consecutive year, a feat matched by only two other REITs and by less than 1% of all U.S. public companies; raising $700 million of well-priced debt capital early in the year, which put us in a strong liquidity position as the pandemic began to spread and enabled us to end 2020 with $267 million of cash in the bank and nothing drawn on our $900 million line of credit; reaching collaborative rent deferral agreements during the early stages of the pandemic with a number of our relationship tenants, which solidified our relationships and set us up for future acquisition business; collecting 95.7% of our rents due for the fourth quarter and 89.7% of our annual base rent for the year 2020; supporting our associates and our community with programs and activities to advance associate well-being, employee engagement and community involvement; and lastly, enhancing our executive leadership team with the appointment of Steve Horn, a 17-year veteran with the company, as our Chief Operating Officer.
As highlighted above, our rent collections continued to trend positive during the quarter, resulting in collections of 95.7% of fourth quarter rents.
For the year 2020, we collected just under 90% of rents due for the year.
And for the month of January 2021, we have collected approximately 95% of the rents due for the month.
I'd also like to highlight that we forgave zero rent in the fourth quarter and only forgave less than 0.5% of our annual rents for the entire year.
Notwithstanding the impact of the pandemic, our broadly diversified portfolio of 3,143 single-tenant retail properties ended the year with an occupancy rate of 98.5%, which continues to exceed our long-term average of 98%.
Approximately 80% of our expiring leases were renewed by the current tenants at approximately 100% of the expiring rent without material investment of lease incentive or tenant improvement dollars and with an average lease renewal term of over six years.
During the fourth quarter, we invested $102 million in 42 new single-tenant retail properties at an initial cash yield of 6.2% and at an average lease duration of 20 years.
For the year 2020, we invested a total of $180 million in 63 new properties at a weighted average initial cash yield of just under 6.5% and with an average lease duration of over 18 years.
We also had an active fourth quarter of dispositions, selling 13 properties for $12 million.
And for the year 2020, we sold 38 properties, raising over $54 million of capital to be redeployed into our business.
We ended the year with $267 million of cash in the bank and zero balance drawn on our $900 million line of credit.
Kevin will provide more details on the $120 million of equity capital we raised in 2020 via our ATM.
Almost 3/4 of our associates have been with the company for at least five years, and approximately half have been with us for 10 years or more.
That's up $0.01 from the preceding third quarter's $0.62.
And AFFO per share was $0.69 per share for the fourth quarter, which is $0.07 per share higher than the preceding third quarter's $0.62.
Additionally, we recognized $2.5 million of deferred rent repayment that was repaid in the fourth quarter and was included in calculating AFFO.
As Jay noted, occupancy was 98.5% at quarter end, up 10 basis points from the prior quarter.
G&A expense for the fourth quarter was 5.7% of revenues and -- for the fourth quarter and then 5.8% for the full year 2020, which is fairly flat with 2019's G&A levels.
Today, we reported rent collections of approximately 95.7% for the fourth quarter and 95% for the month of January 2021.
In the fourth quarter, we also collected, as I mentioned, $2.5 million of rent that was previously deferred, which represented approximately 100% of the deferred rent repayment that was due in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We have included on page 22 of today's supplemental, which is on our website, some disclosure on the amounts and timing of the anticipated repayment of deferred rent over the next couple of years.
At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $50 million or about 7.4% of our annual base rent being recognized on a cash basis as a result of our estimation that it was not probable these tenants were going to pay substantially all of their remaining lease payments.
So this classification required us to write off all outstanding receivable balances for these tenants, which in the fourth quarter was $2 million of rent receivables and $5 million of accrued rent balances totaling $7 million or approximately $0.04 per share for the fourth quarter.
Rent receivables from cash-basis tenants totaled approximately $10 million as of December 31.
First, rent receivables of $4.3 million were -- was fairly flat with September 30 levels and now very much in line with our pre-pandemic rent receivable levels of $3 million to $4 million.
These rent receivables include a general reserve of 16% or $835,000 at December 31.
Secondly, accrued rental income receivables decreased slightly to $54 million and had a general reserve of 11% or $6.9 million at December 31.
In the fourth quarter, we collected $2.5 million of previously deferred rent, which would -- reduces the accrued rental income receivable.
We have currently less than 1% of our annual base rent coming from tenants in bankruptcy, and that primarily consists of Ruby Tuesday today.
And while we agreed to a 25% rent reduction for 15 months ending December 2021, none of our 53 leases were rejected in bankruptcy.
As Jay noted, today, we initiated 2021 core FFO per share guidance of $2.55 to $2.62 per share.
$50 million of our $675 million of total annual base rent as of 12/31/2020.
We've assumed these cash-basis tenants pay 50% of the rent due in 2021 in our guidance, and that's relatively consistent with what they've been paying in recent months.
Additionally, on top of this, we have assumed 2% rent loss from the remainder of our annual base rent, which equates to about $12 million or $13 million in rent.
And those of us -- those of you who have known us for the past 25 years are probably not too surprised by that approach.
We ended the fourth quarter with $267 million of cash on hand and no amounts outstanding on our $900 million bank credit facility.
We raised $60 million of equity in the fourth quarter at just over $40 per share.
It's $350 million with a 3.3% coupon.
Our weighted average debt maturity is now 10.2 years with a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%.
Net debt to gross book assets was 34.4%.
Net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.0 times.
Interest coverage was 4.5 times and fixed charge 4.0 times for the fourth quarter of 2020.
Only five of our 3,000-plus properties are encumbered by mortgages totaling only $11.4 million.
