That is going from $42.4 million to $96.4 million as compared to 2019.
Earnings per share $1.94 for the third quarter as compared to $0.88 in the third quarter of 2019.
On a year-to-date basis, on Slide 8, the net income is up, it's up about $30 million to -- so it's $81.3 million, up from $51.8 million in the year-to-date period of 2019.
And that means, our earnings per share is $1.66 on a year-to-date basis as compared to $1.08 on a year-to-date basis in 2019.
And if you're there on Slide 11, you will notice the first bar change is $0.80, which is titled delayed recording of Q1 and Q2 regulatory assets.
And because we're recording the effect of the General Rate Case through the third quarter, in the third quarter, that $0.80, that's in the first part, represents the earnings that would have been achieved in the first two quarters of the year had the rate case been adopted on time.
And so, we're putting this -- just highlighting this for you, so that when we get to the third quarter of 2021, there is a recognition that we're probably not going to earn $1.94 again per share in the third quarter of 2021, although obviously that would be nice if we could.
The California Rate Case, if it is a docket, the proposed decision is adopted, actually allows for a specific net income about $76 million in test year 2020 and that reflects the authorized equity return on the equity portion of $1.5 billion in rate base.
In addition to California, we have about $110 million of rate base in other states that should earn a similar equity return, again, on a normalized test year kind of basis.
Those factors through the third quarter, are adding about $9.6 million to our year-to-date net income.
We've opened our emergency operations center and totaled 18 times year-to-date.
So, our over 90 balances has increased to about $5.4 million.
We've increased our reserve for doubtful accounts by about $1.6 million to $2.7 million, roughly 50% of that balance is reserved for, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move into the four quarter.
Our incremental expenses dealing with the COVID were less than $100,000 in the third quarter, which we think is good.
Water sales, in aggregate, have been closer to the adopted levels, or about 95% of adopted sales in California, with the increases in customer usage, obviously, with people being home, using more water and that was offset by lower business in industrial uses during the quarter.
As of September 30, we had $113 million in cash and additional current capacity of $170 million through a line of credit.
As Tom mentioned, the Company received a proposed decision in October and then the PD, or the proposed decision, the Commission established a new revenue requirement for Cal Water of $698.7 million for test year 2020.
In the proposed decision, it also authorized $828 million of new capital expenditures or new capital investments across the three years of the rate case cycle.
However, there were 11 items, 11 litigated items, litigated financial items, which were not part of the settlement agreement that we filed with the Commission.
In the proposed decision, the judge agreed with Cal Water's position on all 11 of the litigated financial items.
I will also note on Slide 15 that Cal Water along with the other parties have filed a request for rehearing on the August 27 decision by the Commission, which bars Cal Water and others from continuing to use the WRAM/MCBA, beginning, in our case, in our 2021 Rate Case filing, which will be effective in 2023.
Capital investments for the third quarter were $84.7 million, up 16% over the same period last year.
Year-to-date, our capital investments are $221.3 million, up $13.5 million year-to-date over 2019.
The Company has previously estimated, we'd spend between $260 million and $290 million.
In addition, we announced on October 13, that we had completed and put into service our Palos Verdes Water Reliability Project, which is the largest project in the Company's history, just shy of $100 million project, to bring redundancy to the PV Peninsula down in Southern California, so it's nice to have that wrapped up.
The CPUC adopted a decision granting Cal Water's request for an additional $700 million of additional financing authority, which is expected to be used to help finance the Company's capital program through 2025 or later.
So, this will allow us to go out and raise an additional $700 million of debt or equity to finance our capital growth program in the next five years.
One of the areas that we've been super busy and frankly, or probably, the busiest in business development that we've been probably in the last 20 years as BD, and so Paul is going to give us an update on what's been happening on the business development side.
Year-to-date, our new development efforts have put over 25,000 new customer connections under contract.
Representing over a 5% growth in new customer connections across the Company's subsidiaries.
We do have the midpoint of our target of $275 million for capex, that's very achievable here in 2020 and how much we've done so far.
So we estimate that our rate base in 2020 after the CPUC adopts -- assuming they adopt the proposed decision and the settlement, the California and other state regulated rate base is going to be about $1.6 billion.
As Marty mentioned, that was close to $100 million.
91% of our employees have been at work every single day.
Senate Bill 1386, which is the bill, which is now law after being signed by Governor Newsom, specifies that fire hydrants connected to public water systems are generally not designed or installed to provide water service to aid in the extinguishing of fires that threaten property not served by a water service provider or wildfires.
