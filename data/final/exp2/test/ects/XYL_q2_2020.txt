A replay of today's call will be available until midnight, on August 31.
Today, we are up and running across our manufacturing network at greater than 90% availability.
They drove 10% backlog growth, despite COVID-related macro softness.
You will have seen our announced wins in Telangana, India and with Anglian Water in the U.K. The Telangana irrigation project is our largest win in the country to date, and we do anticipate it will generate roughly $115 million in revenue over the next two to three years.
which combines metrology, communications and digital offerings, is expected to deliver revenues of roughly $90 million over the course of the project.
Our revenue in the quarter declined 12% which was better than we anticipated coming out of the first quarter.
Geographically, U.S. revenues declined 15% as our businesses felt the impact of site shutdowns and project deployment delays.
Emerging markets were down 15% driven largely by the lockdowns in the Middle East and India.
Notably, China grew 6% in the quarter as the utility end market returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels, and industrial and commercial businesses began to modestly recover.
Europe was also a relative bright spot for us as revenues declined a modest 3%.
Orders declined 9% in the quarter, while total backlog grew 10% driven by the large Signature deals Patrick mentioned earlier.
Backlog shippable in 2020 is down 1%.
However, backlog shippable after 2020 is up 23% which gives us confidence that we'll be emerging from 2020 in a position of strength with a solid foundation for growth in 2021 and beyond.
Operating margin was 9.3% in the quarter which I'll review in more detail by segment shortly.
Our teams quickly adapted and began to work in new ways with our customers, our suppliers and internally, enabling us to deliver earnings per share of $0.40, an achievement punctuated by commercial savvy, operational excellence, cost discipline and a focus on what really matters.
Water Infrastructure orders grew 7%, and total backlog grew 24% in the quarter.
This performance was largely driven by the $115 million deal we won in India which is expected to deliver revenue beginning late this year and over the next three years.
Shippable backlog for the remainder of 2020 is up 5%.
Segment revenue declined 8% in the quarter and was significantly impacted by declines in the dewatering, industrial and construction rental business.
This was certainly true this past quarter as our wastewater transport business declined only 4%.
This was an important driver of the strong quarter from our treatment business which grew 7%.
Operating margin in the quarter was 16.2%, contracting on lower volumes and unfavorable mix impacts from dewatering partially offset by productivity, cost savings and price.
The applied water segment's orders declined 17% in the quarter, while revenue declined 13% as site restrictions continue to impact customers across industrial, commercial and residential end markets.
Total segment backlog grew 1% in the quarter.
Geographically, both the United States and emerging markets revenue declined 14%.
However, we saw demand in China begin to recover, growing 2% in the quarter.
Operating margin in the segment was 13.4%.
Margins contracted primarily due to volume declines and inflation partially offset by 570 basis points of productivity and cost savings as well as 100 basis points of price.
Measurement and control solutions orders declined 24% in the quarter, and revenue declined 17% as the metrology business slowed due to utility workforce availability and physical distancing requirements including restrictions on approaching or entering residents' homes.
Despite the near-term challenges, we're very encouraged by the large win we announced with Anglian Water in the U.K. The $90 million contract demonstrates the competitiveness of our AMI and digital solutions to drive key international wins.
Total segment backlog grew 3% year over year with backlog shippable in 2021 and beyond up 12%.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and total liquidity of roughly $2.4 billion driven by the $1 billion green bond offering we issued in June as well as strong cash flow performance in the quarter.
The green bond offering was opportunistic enabling us to lock in longer maturities at historically low rates while effectively prefunding $600 million of maturities due in October 2021 at an after-tax cost of less than 1%.
Operating cash flow improved roughly 50% year over year in our free cash flow of $137 million, more than doubled from the prior year.
This was driven by the continued focus and discipline around working capital, the timing of payment on taxes and the prioritization of our capital spend which was $44 million in the quarter, down almost 30% from the prior year.
Working capital as a percentage of sales improved 110 basis points year over year as our teams continue to drive hard on collections and payment terms while managing inventories in a very challenging demand environment.
I'm pleased with our overall cash performance through the first half of the year, and we now expect free cash flow conversion for this year will be at least 100%.
It is worth noting for a broader context that only 8% of our overall revenue is tied to U.S. utilities capex.
By contrast, opex represents 70% of our overall U.S. utilities revenue, and it remains resilient.
China's recovery which was up 6% in the second quarter is a strong indicator.
We expect revenue declines of 8% to 12% and operating margins in the range of 11% to 11.5%.
This reflects approximately 200 basis points of sequential margin improvement and year over year decrementals of approximately 45%.
The decremental margins are impacted by continued softness in our high-margin dewatering and North American Sensus water businesses, along with a tough prior year compared to last year's third quarter, where we had 90% incremental margins on revenue growth.
This year, we expect to incur $80 million to $100 million in restructuring and realignment charges.
In total, we expect to realize approximately $70 million in savings this year and an additional savings of approximately $80 million in 2021.
We follow that up with the launch of our green financing framework which underpinned our recent $1 billion green bond offering.
