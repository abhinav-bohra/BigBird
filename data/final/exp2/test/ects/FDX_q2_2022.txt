FedEx Ground had an outstanding Cyber Week, with 100 million packages picked up during the first official week of peak.
For example, at FedEx Ground, this means adding 14.4 million square feet to our network, the equivalent of 300 football fields since June of this year.
In Q2 alone, we brought online 24 major expansion projects, with nine of them starting operations in November just weeks before peak.
Last week, we exceeded 111,000 applications, the highest level in FedEx history.
To put this in perspective, we had 52,000 applications the week of May 8.
This has led to appropriate staffing levels of peak, including having more than 60,000 frontline team members since we last spoke in September.
We delivered strong results for the quarter with an 11% increase in adjusted operating income, which exceeded our initial expectations shared during the Q1 call.
Second quarter results include outstanding performance by our team at FedEx Express, where operating income on an as-adjusted basis exceeded $1 billion for the quarter.
FedEx Freight also delivered a strong quarter with an operating margin of 14.7%.
We estimate the effect of labor shortages on our Q2 results was approximately $470 million, in line with our original expectations.
And consistent with the first quarter, Ground once again, bore the majority of these costs to the tune of $285 million.
FedEx Freight has also provided FedEx Ground with intermodal containers, which have already been dispatched nearly 50,000 times.
Q2 delivered our second consecutive quarter of 14% revenue growth, demonstrating the strong demand for our differentiated portfolio and our ability to drive revenue quality as a result.
Our domestic yield growth was 9.1% with fuel in Q2.
In January, the Ground Economy peak surcharge will be replaced by the new Ground Economy delivery surcharge at a $1, solidifying the price point for our Economy product.
We are forecasting that the U.S. domestic parcel market will reach 134 million pieces a day by calendar year 2026, a remarkable 70% growth from 2020.
E-commerce is expected to drive 90% of the parcel market growth.
It will grow at a 5% CAGR through 2026.
Q2 Express international export yield grew 12% and volume grew 7.6%, which is outstanding year-over-year growth.
International export composite yield grew to almost $54 per package, while average daily volume was more than 1.1 million.
International Priority Freight had a very strong quarter with 34% year-over-year revenue growth year-to-date.
As we approach the final stages of physical integration this fiscal year, we are increasing the FedEx brand presence on the road in Europe by approximately 30%, including the rebranding of vehicles and facilities.
We have also launched our new FedEx Ship Manager application in more than 100 countries.
Given the historically challenging nature of peak season, along with the continued staffing challenges felt by numerous companies around the world, we are quite pleased with our second quarter consolidated financial results, with adjusted operating income up 11% year-over-year.
While adjusted earnings per share was unchanged year-over-year, this year's effective tax rate was significantly higher as last year's earnings included a $0.71 per share discrete tax benefit from favorable guidance issued by the IRS.
As we anticipated, most of the headwinds we experienced in the first quarter persisted through the second quarter, which dampened our Q2 profitability by an estimated $770 million.
The difficult labor market once again had the largest effect on our bottom line, representing an estimated $470 million in additional year-over-year costs.
Of the $470 million, we estimate $230 million was incurred in higher wage and purchase transportation rates.
We estimate network inefficiencies resulting from labor shortages, increased costs by approximately $240 million.
Beyond the labor effects, our results for the second quarter also included the following headwinds; $90 million related to investments in the ground network, as Raj outlined earlier, that are critical to improving service and adding capacity; an estimated $75 million in incremental air network costs at Express due to the continued effect of COVID restrictions on our operations; and lastly, a $70 million effect year-over-year from higher federal excise taxes as the waiver ended on December 31, 2020.
Ground reported $8.3 billion in revenue, a 13% increase year-over-year, with operating margin at 5.8%.
Ground operating income was down approximately $70 million and in addition to the $90 million I mentioned earlier, results were significantly affected by higher wage and purchase transportation rates and network inefficiencies amid the constrained labor market.
Express adjusted operating income increased to over $1 billion and reported an adjusted operating margin of 8.8%, which was driven by higher yields and international priority volume growth, which more than offset the negative effects of continued staffing challenges and COVID-19-related air network inefficiencies.
Freight had another outstanding quarter with an operating margin of 14.7% as revenue for Q2 increased 17% year-over-year and operating income increased 33% year-over-year.
Our Q2 results include a net pre-tax non-cash mark-to-market loss of $260 million related to the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands Pension Plan and a curtailment charge related to the U.S. FedEx Freight Pension Plan.
Year-to-date, we spent $3.1 billion in capital as we continue to invest in our strategies for profitable growth, service excellence and modernizing our digital platforms.
Our capital forecast for fiscal 2022 remains at $7.2 billion and less than 8% of anticipated revenue.
We ended our quarter with $6.8 billion in cash and are targeting approximately $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY 2022, which puts us on pace to deliver over $7.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow for FY '21 and '22 combined, far exceeding our historical levels.
As a result of this flexibility, I am pleased to announce our Board has approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization.
And as part of this program, we expect to enter into a $1.5 billion share repurchase program that will be completed by the end of the fiscal year, which is on top of the $750 million of repurchases in the first half of the year.
During Q2, we also made a $250 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan, which mitigates PBGC fees and further strengthens the funded status of our plan for our employees and we expect to make an additional $250 million contribution in February.
As for our FY2022 guidance, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share range to $20.50 to $21.50 to reflect second quarter results and outlook for the second half of the fiscal year as well as the expected benefit from our ASR transaction.
This improved outlook represents another outstanding financial year with a year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share ranging from 13% to 18%, following our strong 2021 results.
In addition, we do not expect a recurrence of approximately $1 billion in notable second half headwinds from a year ago that included the timing of variable compensation expense, historic severe winter weather, a one-time express frontline bonus and our commitment to the Yale Carbon Capture initiative.
And after 23 years with FedEx, he will retire at the end of this month.
I'm pleased to announce we will be hosting an Investor Meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, 28, 29 June 2022 in Memphis.
