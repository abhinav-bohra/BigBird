Our lease-up occupancy exceeded 90%, a level many believe to be a best-case scenario in the early days of this pandemic.
Our rent collection rate improved to 97% in September, the first full month of the new academic year in most of our markets, from approximately 94% in Q2.
As we are not currently holding any discussions for on-campus rental refunds beyond one university partner, which we expect to total only $1 million -- approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter versus the $15 million we contributed in the second quarter of the prior academic year.
The survey received responses from over 12,000 of our residents.
Not surprising, according to the survey, 85% of respondents are more stressed as a result of the global pandemic.
During the quarter, we provided $2.1 million in rent refunds to on-campus residents at one ACE Partnership University, which we expect to decrease to $1.2 million in the fourth quarter.
This is in comparison to the $15 million provided to residents that are primarily on-campus residence halls in the second quarter.
With regard to students and parents being impacted by COVID-19, we instituted our Resident Hardship Program during the second quarter where we provided over $8 million of financial assistance.
During the current quarter, the amount totaled $4.7 million, with the majority of this amount relating to our prior academic year leases.
In September, based on significantly lower levels of requests within the program, we gave approximately $175,000 in direct rent relief during the month.
In regards to collections, we had a 97% collection rate on our rent charge for September, a significant improvement from the 93.7% seen during the second quarter.
As expected, our third quarter other income was impacted by $8.4 million due to the loss of summer camp conference business, the continued waiver of online transaction fees and late payment fees, and higher levels of bad debt.
With regard to same-store opex, we were able to partially offset lost revenue with savings and operating expenses of 5.2%, led by savings in all of our controllable categories.
In the current academic year, residents have reported a total of approximately 1,500 positive COVID-19 cases or 1.7% of our occupied beds.
At this time, we are tracking only 110 active cases or 0.1% of our occupied beds.
As of September 30, our 2020-2021 same-store portfolio was 90.3% leased, with in-place rents growing 1.1% over prior year.
However, as you will see in the chart, we gained approximately 300 additional leases at our properties that primarily serve sophomores and above, which offsets the decreasing at our properties, primarily serving first year students as our university partners finalize their move-in in assignment processes.
We still anticipate the projects will stabilize at development yields of 6.25 upon a return to normalcy on each campus.
With the continued temporary suspension of the Disney College Program, both delivered phases, which totaled 406 units and 1,624 beds remain unoccupied at the current time.
We expect to earn a total of $3 million in development fees, and we'll manage the project upon completion.
Of the 68 owned markets where ACC currently operates, 85% of universities have reported statistics for the fall.
Overall, we've seen only a 0.3% decline in enrollment across those 58 markets.
50% of our universities experienced increased enrollment in fall 2020, with an average increase in students of 2.5%.
Of the half of our universities that had decreases in enrollment, they only averaged a 3.1% decline for fall 2020.
First year student enrollment is only down 1.1% for fall.
As Jennifer discussed, our properties that primarily serve first year students are currently 77% occupied.
As international students typically constitute less than 10% of enrollment in our portfolio, while demand from domestic students remains deep to replace any loss from international students.
With 51% of our universities having released fall 2020 international data, there has been a 14% decline in international students.
Yet those same universities have grown the much larger segment of domestic enrollment by 1.2%.
Within ACC's 68 markets, we are now tracking 21,150 beds currently under construction for 2021, of a potential additional 400 beds planned, but not yet under construction, reflecting a decline of 2% to 4% in new supply off the current year's decline in new supply of 20%.
As we reported last night, total FFOM for the third quarter of 2020 was $45.2 million or $0.32 per fully diluted share.
While the company's near-term earnings will, of course, be affected by the governmental and university actions taken in response to the pandemic, we believe that we are on a path to return to a relative level of normalcy both operationally and financially after achieving over 90% for this fall despite the amount of ongoing online instruction as well as seeing significant reductions in delinquencies, refunds, and resident hardships as we have started the new academic year.
Like last quarter, we cannot completely isolate every item related to the pandemic, but we believe FFOM was negatively impacted by approximately $19 million versus our original expectations for the quarter.
And year-to-date, FFOM has been negatively impacted by approximately $42 million to $43 million.
Total property revenue was approximately $27 million impacted for the quarter, with $15 million due to COVID-related rent relief, lost summer camp revenue, increased bad debt, and wave fees.
And $12 million due to lower opening occupancy for the fall semester relative to our original expectations.
Partially offsetting the loss revenue, property operating expenses were $7.5 million than -- lower than originally budgeted, as Jennifer discussed.
Also as a result of the lower originally budgeted property NOI, joint venture partners' noncontrolling interest and earnings was approximately $700,000 lower, and ground lease expense was approximately $1.4 million less due to a reduction in outperformance rent being paid to our university ground lessor partners as well as Disney's agreement to waive ground rent on the Disney College Program housing until occupancy resumes.
Additionally, third-party management fee income was approximately $1.2 million lower than expected.
And FFOM contributed from our on-campus participating properties was almost $500,000 lower, due to University's refunding a portion of rents and lower fall occupancies at properties in both of these business segments.
Lastly, we benefited from approximately $700,000 in G&A and third-party overhead expense savings relative to our original plan due to both reduced travel and payroll costs.
If the current environment remains stable, though, we are hopeful that the reduction in revenue through the remainder of the year should be limited to the impact of the 90.3% occupancy we achieved for the opening of the fall semester, and the $1.2 million in rent refunds that we have agreed to for the fourth quarter at one of our ACE partnership universities.
Also, while delinquencies and resident hardships have improved significantly in September, we still expect to run at an elevated level of bad debt relative to the 1% level we typically operated at prior to the pandemic.
However, with the new academic year physical occupancy levels above 90% and approximately $2.5 million to $3 million in expected additional annual costs for COVID-related cleaning supplies and procedures, we do not expect to be able to create expense savings at the same levels we did in the second and third quarters.
These projects were expected to contribute a combined $4 million in development fee income in the fourth quarter of 2020.
As of September 30, we had $44 million in cash on hand and over $720 million of availability on our corporate revolver, with no remaining debt maturities in 2020, and a manageable $167 million in secured mortgage debt maturing in 2021.
Also, as detailed on Page S16 of our earnings supplemental, the remaining phases of the Walt Disney World project represent our only ongoing development with phases spanning through 2023 and only $201 million in remaining development capital needs.
As of September 30, the company's debt to total asset value was 41.3%, and net debt-to-EBITDA was 8.1 times.
It's worth noting that excluding the impacts of COVID on operating results this year, net debt-to-EBITDA would be in the range of seven to 7.1 times.
Although our leverage levels are temporarily elevated relative to the targets we have historically communicated, we feel confident that with the three-year capital plan we layout on Page S16 as well as the expected normalization of the EBITDA, the company's debt to total assets will return to the mid-30% range and net debt-to-EBITDA to the high five to low six times range.
