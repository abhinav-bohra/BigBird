We reported Q3 revenue of $755 million, up 29% and cash earnings per share of $3.52, up 25%, so both of those all-time record highs for the company.
Also, the Q3 results annualized, finally above $3 billion, so past the $3 billion mark in revenue and $14 in cash EPS.
Organic revenue for the quarter, up 17%.
And inside of that, Corporate Payments business grew 22% organically.
Sales finishing at record levels, up over 50% versus Q3 last year and over 30% against the baseline of Q3 '19.
Retention, steady as she goes at 93% for the quarter.
And again, our global fuel card business inside of that also coming at 93%.
Same-store sales strengthened plus 5% for the quarter, which further adds to the same-store sales rebound we saw in Q2.
That did shave about $0.20 off the $3.52 that we reported for the quarter.
So revenue guidance at the midpoint now, $2.795 billion, that's up $30 million from August.
Cash earnings per share at the midpoint to $13.05, that's up $0.15 from August.
If you look at the Q4 on its own, it anticipates revenue and profit growth up about 20% versus Q4 last year and about 10% against Q4 2019.
We signed up almost 50,000 new business clients globally in Q3.
So 50,000 new accounts joined the fold, so a record.
Over 50% of all of our global fuel card sales now come to us through our digital channels.
Our urban sales or kind of the city dwellers that are lower frequency toll users represented 23% of all new sales in the quarter.
We don't talk about it much, but our customer acquisition cost is really quite attractive, runs about 65% of the sales new revenue, so really super important for profitable growth.
So super early, but it looks like about 10% of our fuel card clients that pay their bills with our new Corpay One platform are choosing to pay a second non-fleet Cor bill with us, so effectively becoming bill pay customers.
We're looking at somewhere around 10,000 to 20,000 SMB bill pay clients coming online in 2022.
And also interesting, we plan to launch what we call our 2-in-1 solution before year-end that will combine our smart business cards with our bill pay platform into one interface.
EBITDA up almost 50% versus prior year.
So we closed at September one about 3.5 million incremental annual hotel rooms, will be added to our lodging business.
And early view is about $0.20 accretive to 2022.
First, the run rate, we're exiting '21 with about $3 billion of annualized revenue and $14 of cash EPS.
We also expect sales to grow again next year about 20%.
And then I mentioned the acquisitions, particularly AFEX and ALE, together contributing probably about $0.50 of incremental accretion next year.
So that's laid out on, I think, page 14 of the earnings supplement.
For Q3 of 2021, we reported revenue of $755 million, up 29%; GAAP net income of $234 million, up 24%; and GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.80, up 28%.
Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 22% to $294 million or roughly $1.2 billion annualized.
ANI per diluted share increased 25% to $3.52.
Organic revenue growth was 17%, driven by continued strong sales, solid retention levels and same-store sales recovery.
Corporate Payments was up 22% in the third quarter, highlighted by full AP, which grew over 50% again this quarter.
Corpay One, our small business-focused full AP offering, grew 78%.
Cross-border revenue was up 19%, which showed some softness from the lockdowns down under in Australia.
So while these partners drive some volume growth, they still only represent about 13% of our Corporate Payments revenue.
Fuel was up organically 13% year-over-year, with strong retention trends and record digital sales continuing to drive the performance.
Tolls was up 14% compared with last year and showed impressive performance again this quarter, growing to above six million total tag holders, with five million consumer tags and one million business tags.
Now just for context, the business had approximately 4.5 million total tag holders when we acquired it back in 2016.
Lodging was particularly strong, up 40%, with airline lodging up 61% on the back of the recovery in domestic air travel.
Gift organic growth was 25% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel.
Operating expenses were up 30% to $417 million and were 55% of revenue, stable with last year.
Interest expense decreased 7% to $29 million, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash balances and lower LIBOR rates more than offsetting higher debt and securitization balances.
As Ron mentioned, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was higher than expected, coming in at 24.1%.
We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $650 million of undrawn availability on our revolver.
In total, we had $4.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1.1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility.
As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.76 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.
We used $406 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $260 per share.
We still have $1.18 billion of share buyback capacity in our program.
So far this year, we've bought back 3.1 million shares and we've closed three deals, putting $1.7 billion of capital to work.
