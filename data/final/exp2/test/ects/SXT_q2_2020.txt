The growth in these businesses was offset by the adverse impact of COIVD-19 in the personal care market and throughout Latin America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.
Overall, the impact of COIVD-19 has reduced our earnings per share by approximately $0.10 year-to-date.
Adjusted local currency revenue for the Group was up 5.7%.
This quarter, the Flavor Group returned to quarterly profit growth with adjusted local currency operating profit up 8%.
Overall, the Group's operating profit margin was up 30 basis points in the quarter and I would anticipate a 50 basis point to 100 basis point improvement for the year.
Unfortunately, the growth in Food & Beverage Colors revenue was offset by a more than 20% decline in our Personal Care business revenue.
However, profit in Personal Care in the quarter was down by more than 35% due to the lower demand in make-up and other personal care products, and that was the main reason for the Color Group's overall decline in profit.
