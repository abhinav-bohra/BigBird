Let me reference our safe harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
And we shared with you two goals that underpin our efforts: first, to accelerate market share capture with a target growth rate of at least 400 basis points above IP by the end of our fiscal 2023; second, to return ROIC into the high teens powered not only by leveraging growth, but also by structural cost takeout of 90 to $100 million also by the end of fiscal 2023.
With respect to revenues, we committed to achieve a minimum of 200 basis points of positive spread versus the IP by our fiscal fourth quarter.
Q3 is muted by PPE comps, but the non-safety and non-janitorial business grew about 21% year over year, and we expect our total company growth to meet or exceed our fiscal Q4 commitment.
We've already exceeded our $25 million cost takeout goal for fiscal 2021 for the full year.
We will build on our momentum and continue making progress toward our goal of 400 basis points or more of market outgrowth as measured against the IP index.
On the structural cost front, we'll deliver roughly $20 million of incremental savings on top of that, which has been achieved over the past two years.
Nonetheless, we expect incremental margins at/or above 20%.
That said, we are very well-positioned to navigate the current environment, particularly when compared to the local and regional distributors who make up 70% of our market.
Revenues were up 2.2% on an average daily sales basis as we're seeing continued sequential improvement in our sales levels.
Most notably, non-safety and non-janitorial product lines improved through the quarter from mid-single-digit declines in our second quarter to 21% growth in our third quarter.
Sales of safety and janitorial products, as expected, given the significant surge during the pandemic last year, declined just over 40% for the quarter.
However, including all product lines and given the extremely difficult comparisons, government sales declined nearly 40%.
June showed continued improvement with total company year-over-year growth estimated at 15.4%.
Our non-safety and non-janitorial growth is estimated at roughly 20%, while safety and janitorial are estimated to be down roughly 10% against last year's continued PPE surge.
And as a result, we saw a sequential lift in gross margin from our fiscal second quarter's adjusted rate of 42%.
Aerospace is roughly 10% of total MSC sales today.
Our third-quarter sales were 866 million, up 3.8% versus the same quarter last year.
So on an average daily sales basis, net sales increased 2.2%.
Erik gave some details on our sales growth, but I'll just reiterate that our non-safety and non-janitorial sales grew 21% in the quarter, while our safety and janitorial sales declined 42%.
Our gross margin for fiscal Q3 was 42.3%, up 30 basis points sequentially after adjusting our inventory writedown from last quarter and down just 10 basis points from last year.
Operating expenses in the third quarter were 257.3 million or 29.7% of sales versus 242.8 million or 29.1% of sales in the prior year.
Our third quarter includes just 400,000 of legal costs associated with the loss recovery, which I'll discuss shortly.
So OPEX as a percent of sales, excluding those costs, was the same as the GAAP figure or 29.7%.
Recall that our adjusted OPEX for Q2 was 244 million.
A 90 million increase in sales means roughly 9 million of variable-related OPEX.
We're pleased to report that last month, we received a 20.8 million loss recovery of the original 26.7 million impairment loss recorded in Q1.
That recovery is below the operating expense line in the P&L, but it does increase our GAAP operating income such that our GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 14.8%.
Excluding the 20.8 million loss recovery and associated legal fees, as well as restructuring charges during the quarter of 1.3 million, our adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, down 70 basis points from the prior year.
GAAP earnings per share were $1.68.
Adjusted for the loss recovery, as well as restructuring and other charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.42.
Our free cash flow was 3 million in the third quarter, as compared to 49 million in the prior year.
I would also note that we repurchased 47 million of stock during the quarter or about 507,000 shares at an average price of 92.92 per share.
In fact, to date in our fiscal Q4, we repurchased another 229,000 shares at an average price of $89.07.
Lastly, when it comes to cash flows, please note that the 20.8 million loss recovery was received in June and will therefore be reflected in our fiscal fourth-quarter cash flows.
As of the end of fiscal Q3, we were carrying 598 million of inventory, up 66 million from last quarter.
We still expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year of approximately 55 million, and we still expect our cash flow conversion or operating cash flow divided by net income to be above 100% for fiscal 2021.
Our total debt as of the end of the third quarter was 759 million, reflecting a 75 million increase from our second quarter.
As for the composition of our debt, 187 million was on our revolving credit facility.
About 200 million was under our uncommitted facilities, 20 million was short-term fixed-rate borrowings, and 345 million was long-term fixed-rate borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents were 27 million, resulting in net debt of 732 million at the end of the quarter.
On Slide 8, you can see our original program goals of 90 to a hundred million of cost takeout through fiscal 2023, and that is versus fiscal 2019.
Our cumulative savings for the first half of fiscal '21 were 17 million, and we saved another 12 million in our third quarter bringing our year-to-date savings to 29 million against our goal of 25 million by the end of this year.
We also had invested roughly to 7 to 8 million in the first half of fiscal '21, and we invested another $7 million in our third quarter, bringing our total year-to-date investments to 15 million, which compares to our original full-year target of 15 million.
Given the success of the program through the first three quarters, we now expect to achieve savings for fiscal 2021 of roughly 40 million.
Regarding total investments for fiscal '21, we now expect roughly 25 million, which would result in net savings of 15 million for this year.
Furthermore, and as Erik mentioned earlier, we expect to achieve 20% or higher incremental margins in both fiscal '22 and fiscal 2023.
All of that should translate into incremental margins at/or above 20% for the next two years.
