As shown on slide four, earnings growth from continuing operations increased 13.2%, resulting in our 14th year in a row of record earnings.
We also achieved a consolidated return on equity above 11%, which is something we've done each year since 2005.
I note that we achieved these financial results in a year where our total capital investments once again approached $200 million, representing 18% of total capitalization.
Toward the end of the year, subsequent to our inclusion in the S&P 600 Small-Cap Index, and reflecting our strong, consistent financial performance, the Chesapeake stock price increased above pre-COVID-19 levels.
Chesapeake Board followed our long-standing practice of closely correlating annualized dividend growth to our earnings growth and declared an annualized dividend of $1.76 per share, an 8.6% increase and the 17th consecutive year of increased dividends.
We've now doubled our annualized dividend per share over the past 10 years.
As shown on slide five, at year-end, the Chesapeake Utilities' total shareholder return exceeded 15%, the top level of performance among other gas utilities for the year.
Including 2020, our total shareholder return compound annual growth rate over one-, three-, five-, 10- and 20-year historic periods has exceeded 13% for each period, representing long-term upper quartile performance compared to our peer group.
We've doubled our market capitalization twice over the past 10 years, and 2020 was another step down on the path to continue growing our business.
We ended the year with Chesapeake Utilities' market capitalization at $1.9 billion, more than doubling from 2015.
Net income for 2020 was $71.5 million or $4.28 per share compared to $65.2 million and $3.96 per share for 2019.
Shown on slide seven, the company's net income from continuing operations for 2020 was $70.6 million or $4.21 diluted earnings per share.
This represents an increase of $9.5 million or $0.49 a share above 2019 results.
We had significant margin growth in 2020, totaling over $25 million.
Our margin results would have been even higher, but they were partially offset by $4.3 million lower gross margins due to a decline in customer consumption driven primarily by weather and the unfavorable net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In 2020, we deferred a total of $1.9 million in distribution utility expenses.
The after-tax impact of COVID-19 in 2020 was approximately $1 million or $0.06 per share.
At the beginning of 2019 with a market capitalization of approximately $1.3 billion, we set an aggressive internal goal to double the size of our company in five years.
That may seem ambitious, but we had already achieved that level of growth twice over the previous 10 years.
Capital expenditures totaled $196 million.
We advanced multiple pipeline expansion projects, most notably, the Callahan Pipeline in Florida went into service early and under budget, producing $30.9 million in incremental margin in 2020.
We worked hard last year to rebalance our capital structure and achieve our 50% equity target.
We obtained $89.7 million of new equity from our ATM program and various stock plans, which was certainly helpful as Chesapeake Utilities -- the S&P 600 small-Cap index in September.
We also retained $42.4 million of earnings in 2020, increasing stockholders' equity to $697.1 million and achieving the 50% of total capitalization.
Net income for the quarter was $22.4 million compared to the same quarter of last year.
In terms of continuing operations for the quarter, our income from continuing operations grew by $4.5 million or 27%.
EPS for the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year grew by $0.20 to $1.24 per share from $1.04, representing growth of 19% because of the equity issued in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Net income for 2020 for the year was $71.5 million or $4.26 per share compared to $65.2 million or $3.96 per share for 2019.
The company's net income from continuing operations for 2020 was $70.6 million or $4.21 per share.
This represents an increase of $9.5 million or $0.49 per share above 2019 results of $3.72 or 13.2% growth.
For 2020, gross margin increased 7.7% while operating -- other operating expenses were up less than half of that growth at 2.7%.
Keep in mind, the 7.7% increase in gross margin is inclusive of $4.3 million of milder weather that we experienced and $5.3 million of lower margin associated with COVID-19.
If you exclude the COVID-19 impact, our operating income growth would have been, on a consolidated basis, 12.2% versus reported 6.1%; for our Regulated Energy segment, 11.3% versus reported of 6.4%; and for our Unregulated Energy segment, 12.1% versus 3.6%.
Excluding the incremental expenses associated with new acquisitions, where there was also a corresponding margin growth, our other operating expense growth was 1.3% on a consolidated basis, 1.6% for our Regulated Energy segment and 0.8% for our Unregulated Energy segment.
Finally, depreciation, amortization and property tax increased $14.5 million associated with our continued property expansions and new investment related to our growth initiatives.
And what you can see is that excluding weather and the negative impacts of COVID-19, gross margin increased $34.9 million or $1.52 per share.
Higher earnings for 2020 reflect increased earnings from the Hurricane Michael regulatory settlement reached with the Florida PSC, and that's $0.23 per share after associated depreciation and amortization of regulatory assets.
Pipeline expansion projects added $0.35 per share.
Contributions from the acquisitions of Boulden, Elkton and Western Natural Gas added $0.09 per share net of their incremental expenses.
Organic growth in the natural gas distribution operations added $0.15 per share.
Marlin had increased margin that added an additional $0.08 per share.
Our propane distribution operations generated higher retail propane margins that contributed $0.08 per share.
Rate increases for Aspire added $0.06, and we had incremental margin from our Florida GRIP program that included $0.05 per share.
And lastly, margins from some of Eastern Shore's capital improvements and nonservice expansion projects also added $0.05 per share.
These increases were offset by lower gross margin again due to a decline in customer consumption driven primarily by weather $0.19 per share and the net unfavorable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or $0.06 per share.
The settlement agreement allowed FPU to, first, refund the overcollection of interim rates through the fuel charge; second, record regulatory assets for storm costs in the amount of $45.8 million, including interest, which will be amortized over six years; third, we cover those storm costs through a surcharge for a total of $7.7 million annually; and finally, collect an annual increase in revenue of $3.3 million to recover capital costs associated with new plants and a regulatory asset for the cost of removal and undepreciated plants.
On an annual basis, the settlement contributed $3.8 million in net income after tax or $0.23 per share, as I mentioned previously.
As you can see on slide 14, spending in 2020 totaled $196 million, within the guidance that we provided for the year.
Our regulated distribution and transmission businesses represented 75% of new capital additions in 2020.
The initial forecast for 2021 capital expenditures remains at similar levels, ranging between $175 million and $200 million.
Again, the investment is concentrated with about 80% budgeted in new regulated energy assets.
For the five years ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures totaled $1 billion.
In terms of guidance through 2022 of $750 million to $1 billion, we are expecting to invest over $850 million by the end of 2021, exceeding our lower end estimate of $750 million and already reaching 85% of the $1 billion higher end of the range.
These pipeline expansions represent $116 million and span our footprint, including in Florida, Ohio and on Delmarva.
Incremental gross margin is estimated to be $21.7 million once these projects are fully in service by the fourth quarter of 2021.
Key projects are expected to generate approximately $66 million and $73 million for the years 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Pipeline expansions are expected to generate $7 million in incremental margin in 2021, shy by $1 million of the incremental $8 million added in 2020.
The Hurricane Michael proceedings settlement accounted for $11 million in incremental margin in 2020 and remains at that level for 2021 and 2022.
We particularly note the margin estimate of $10.5 million for 2022 from the recent acquisitions of Boulden, Elkton and Western Natural Gas approximately double the 2020 gross margin contribution.
In total, the incremental margin growth from these projects and initiatives represents approximately $27 million for 2020, $16 million for 2021 and $7 million for 2022.
As you can see on slide 17, as of the end of the year, total capitalization was $1.4 billion comprised of 50% stockholders' equity, 36% long-term debt at fixed rate and 14% short-term debt, including outstanding borrowings under our revolver and the current portion of long-term debt.
During 2020, we added a net incremental $204 million of permanent capital, including in our stockholders' equity and long-term debt.
Our recent equity issuance moved us to our target equity to total capitalization range beginning at 50%.
We successfully utilized our first ATM program and various stock plans to raise just under $90 million in new equity gross proceeds and issued $90 million in new long-term debt at an average rate of 2.98%.
As you can see on slide 20, we're resetting our five -year capital guidance for the period 2021 to 2025 to $750 billion.
Our projected diluted earnings per share range in 2025 is $6.05 to $6.25.
The 2025 guidance range represents an average earnings per share growth of approximately 10% from our initiation of guidance at the end of 2017.
