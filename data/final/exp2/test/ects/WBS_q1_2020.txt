Consistent with the way our values based organization has operated since our founding during the Great Depression in 1935.
We swiftly moved 80% of our workforce to remote or at-home work thereby creating a safer socially distance work setup in our buildings for those who need to be on-site to execute the central operations.
We've paid all of our employees at 100% of pay, including those who are home because of illness, quarantine, higher health risk or to take care of loved ones or kids home because of school closures.
As of April 16, we have modified over 2,000 units, representing $476 million of residential mortgages and home equities, that's approximately 6.5% of total home equity and mortgage balances, roughly 750 borrowers or $300 million of small business loans, representing approximately 17% of our small business portfolio outstandings, and over 300 borrowers and close to $1.6 billion of commercial loans or roughly 13% of the funded commercial loan portfolio.
When the SBA stopped accepting applications last Thursday, we had more than 2,000 SBA approved loans, representing approximately $650 million, most of which should be funded over the next week.
We've made more than $375,000 in donations thus far to Feeding America, the American Red Cross and United Way's across our footprint to provide urgent basic needs.
Pre-provision net revenue of $125 million was up modestly from Q4, driven by a slight increase in total revenue and a slight decline in expenses.
Earnings per share were $0.39 in the quarter compared to $0.96 in Q4 of 2019 and $1.06 in the prior year's first quarter.
Tangible book value per common share increased 8% from prior year.
Our first quarter return on common equity was 4.75%, and return on tangible common equity was 5.95%, with each reflecting the $68 million reserve build in the quarter.
The combination of a slight increase in total revenue and a slight decrease in expenses led to improvement in the efficiency ratio, which was 58% in Q1.
Loan growth was strong as total loans grew 11%, and commercial loans grew almost 16% from a year ago or by more than $1.8 billion.
Strong organic growth in CRE was augmented by approximately $450 million in revolver drawdowns in the commercial portfolio in March and we saw a reduction in prepayment activity.
Deposits grew 7.7% year-over-year, driven by the inflow of HSA deposits and public funds, and transactional and HSA deposits now represent 60% of total deposits, up from 57% a year ago.
Also of note, footings at HSA Bank increased 9% from a year ago for growth of $679 million during the year.
In Commercial Banking, loans were up nearly 7% linked quarter and 15.5% from a year ago, which includes the aforementioned $450 million in net revolver draws.
Deposits were up smartly some 15% linked quarter and 20% from a year ago, largely driven by the depositing of revolver draws into DDA.
Normalizing for revolver usage, deposits were up approximately 5% in Commercial Banking in the quarter.
Loan and deposit volumes in the quarter drove a 3% year-over-year increase in net interest income and Commercial Banking despite rate pressure.
Expenses were up 4.3% year-over-year, driven by investment in people and technology.
In fact, in early April, we closed our largest agency deal on a best efforts basis, a $350 million technology infrastructure deal where we held just over 10% of the risk after close.
We concluded another successful first quarter as we opened 338,000 new accounts for a total of 734,000 new accounts opened over the last 12 months.
In addition, we added over 1,000 new employers in the quarter.
Ending accounts were up 6.4% to $3.1 million, while deposits increased 8.5% to $6.7 billion.
One important point to note is that HSA Bank's funded account growth rate was 9.2% in 2019 compared to the industry rate of 5.6%.
In the first quarter, our funded account growth rate was 6.8% year-over-year, both reflective of our consistently low percentage of unfunded accounts when compared to industry data.
In addition, as you may have seen, yesterday, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire State Farm Bank's portfolio of seasoned HSA accounts, representing approximately $140 million in deposits.
In response to the pandemic and consistent with all of Webster, we were able to quickly transition 96% of our HSA staff to work from home in less than three weeks, maintaining 24/7 customer support and continuing to meet service and quality metrics.
I'm on Page 7.
Total community bank loans grew by 5% year-over-year with business banking loans leading the way at 9%.
Deposits grew by 3%, again led by business banking.
Non-interest income was up 9% as a result of higher mortgage and investment services revenue.
Many more customers have transitioned to self-service channels as digitally active households crossed 50% in the quarter for the first time and we see that trend continuing given the pandemic.
Also after a modest repurchase of approximately 2 million shares in early Q1 before the onset of the pandemic, we do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares until this pandemic is behind us.
Average loans grew $516 million or 2.6% linked quarter.
A linked quarter increase of $329 million in commercial real estate was the result of strong originations and a reduction in pay-offs.
On a year-over-year basis, our commercial real estate loans grew more than $1 billion.
Commercial loans now represent 66% of total loans compared to 63% in prior year.
Consumer loan performance was driven by a $96 million increase in residential mortgages with some offset in home equity.
On the deposit side, our low-cost transactional and HSA deposits have increased more than $1.2 billion from last year and now represent 60% of total deposits with a combined cost of 13 basis points.
The Q1 seasonal inflow of HSA and government deposits funded loan growth, as well as a $200 million reduction in short-term borrowings.
With regard to capital, the modest average linked quarter reduction in common equity is reflective of a day one CECL adjustment of $58 million and approximately $77 million as a result of share repurchases in the quarter.
Likewise, modest reductions in the common equity Tier 1 and tangible common equity ratios are also reflective of CECL, share repurchases and asset growth.
We have elected to phase in the CECL impact on regulatory capital, which favorably impacts our ratios by 20 basis points to 25 basis points.
Net interest income was flat to prior quarter as the $6 million benefit from loan growth was offset by the effect of a lower rate environment.
This is reflective in our net interest margin, which was lower by four basis points versus Q4, 16 basis points due to lower loan yield, which was partially offset by nine basis points from lower deposit costs and three basis points from lower borrowing costs.
Versus prior year, net interest income declined $11 million, $31 million of the decline was due to lower market rates with a partial offset of $20 million from earning asset growth.
Non-interest income increased $2.5 million linked quarter and $4.8 million from prior year.
HSA fee income increased $3.4 million as a result of account growth and the seasonal increase in interchange.
In addition, our mark-to-market on hedging activity increased $2.6 million, which was offset by a decline in syndication and client swap revenue.
Reported non-interest expense of $179 million declined modestly linked quarter and grew less than 2% from prior year.
Pre-provision net revenue of $125 million increased $3 million from Q4 and decreased $9 million from prior year.
Provision for credit losses for the quarter was $76 million, which I will explain in more detail shortly.
The efficiency ratio improved to 58% from 58.5% in Q4, reflecting a modest increase in revenue and a slight decrease in non-interest expense.
And our effective tax rate was 22.6% compared to 22.3% in Q4.
As we look at the walk, the day one CECL adoption was $58 million, a 28% increase in the allowance, resulting in a starting coverage ratio of 1.33%.
During the quarter, we had $7.8 million in net charge-offs.
We recorded a $12 million provision as a result of loan growth of $855 million during the quarter.
Loan growth primarily came from the commercial categories and included $450 million in line draws in March, slower prepayment activity and loans funded from our strong fourth quarter pipeline.
The remaining Q1 provision was $64 million, bringing our allowance to $335 million or a coverage of 1.6%.
At the time we closed the books in early April, our outlook included a second quarter GDP decline of nearly 20% with unemployment peaking just under 10% and a recovery beginning in the second half of 2020.
Initial April economic forecast are projected to be more severe as the second quarter GDP decline could exceed 30% with unemployment peaking near 15%.
Non-performing loans in the upper left increased $12 million from Q4.
C&I represented $9 million of the increase.
Net charge-offs in the upper right increased slightly from Q4 and totaled $7.8 million in the quarter.
Commercial classified loans in the lower left represented 287 basis points of total commercial loans.
This compares to a 20-quarter average of 317 basis points.
The allowance for credit losses increased to $335 million, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.6%.
More than $1.1 billion of core deposit growth in Q1 has maintained our favorable loan to deposit ratio of 85%.
We are predominantly core deposit funded with brokerage CDs representing less than 0.5% of total deposits at March 31.
In addition, our sources of secured borrowing capacity remain intact, totaling over $9 billion at March 31.
The common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11% exceeds well-capitalized by $1 billion, while the excess for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is $809 million.
What I can tell you is, we expect average earning assets to grow in the range of 4% over Q1, driven primarily by loan growth.
Our share count will be about 1.3 million shares lower on average due to buybacks completed in Q1.
The nearly $21 billion loan portfolio we have today has been thoughtfully and purposefully built.
I'll then provide what I hope to be a clear and concise comparison of our current loan and securities portfolios with our 2007 pre-Great Recession portfolios.
And then I'll briefly walk through each of our loan portfolios allowing Jason to provide some context with key metrics, so hopefully, you'll get a sense, have a clear granular view of the $21 billion we have in loans.
This attempts to capture our loan outstandings in each of the most impacted sectors, including rating of categories, modification and line draw activity through 3/31, which Jason will update in a moment.
In fact, 94% of these loans are pass-rated and you'll see here that there has been limited modification and revolver draw activities, so I want to provide a little context there.
94% as I said are in pass-rated categories, most representing 1% or maybe 2% of our total loan portfolio.
The other point I want to make before letting Jason provide some context is that you'll see retail in -- as broadly defined represents 5% of our loan portfolio.
In this category, more than 50% of those loans are in high-quality investor CRE, and those are mostly in non-discretionary pharmacy or grocery anchored.
And for those of you who've heard me talk about Bill Wrang over 25 years, with his retail exposure, he's always looking for non-discretionary.
I'll also tell you that an additional 20% of that retail exposure is fully followed in our ABL Group, where credits are borrowing base secured and often have cash dominion.
And I've been working with Warren Mino in that group for the entire 15 years I've been here and they have an unbelievable track record in managing even struggling large retail exposure.
Modifications are up to $692 million versus the $517 million.
Revolver draws in these sectors are up modestly to $130 million versus $122 million.
That said, as John mentioned early, commercial modifications in total have been roughly $1.85 billion as of late last week.
By exposure, we've reviewed over 80% of the accounts in the portfolio and have reached out to the majority of those where we have direct relationships.
I will also say that 90% of the borrowers that have requested modifications are pass-rated and many have low loan to values, junior capital, owner and sponsor support and liquidity.
Turning to Page 16, these next three slides demonstrate the purposeful strategic shifts in our portfolio since the Great Recession.
But I can tell you that our portfolio today is vastly different than what we had in 2007.
Not only are the portfolio dynamics different, but the way we underwrite, manage and report on risk is light-years ahead of where we were in 2007 when we had only a few years earlier transitioned to be an OCC regulated commercial bank.
We centrally underwrite everything internally even correspondent in market loans, and we have been very disciplined on underwriting guidelines over the last 10 years.
On Page 17, it shows the same analysis for our Commercial Banking portfolios.
While our sponsor and leveraged loan portfolios are larger today on an absolute basis, I'll remind you that they represent roughly the same percentage of C&I loans as they represented in 2007, and they represent roughly the same percentage of Tier 1 capital plus reserves that they represented in 2007.
On Page 18, this is a critical slide.
Today, only 18% of our $8.5 billion securities portfolio is credit-sensitive compared to 44% in 2007.
And I can tell you that we've pivoted over time in the last 12 years on things like contractors or traditional advertising-based media, so that we're able to make decisions quickly to reduce emphasis in certain portfolios over time and we've done that.
You can see a high-level breakdown here of the $21 billion, and in the carats on the right, you'll see where those exposures reside.
So for consumer finance, the $7.2 billion portfolio, $7 billion of that are prime in-market residential mortgages and home equity loans, and then a small pocket of consumer finance, which includes Lending Club.
Our commercial real estate is comprised of a majority of it in our Commercial Banking Investor CRE book run by Bill Wrang for over 21 years here, who's had great asset performance even during the Great Recession.
And on page 36 in the supplemental information, please don't turn to it now, you'll see a detailed breakdown of the investment securities portfolio, which I will not cover here.
On Page 20, residential mortgage.
The key takeaway on this slide is that our $5 billion mortgage portfolio is a high-quality prime in-market centrally underwritten portfolio with high FICO scores and modest LTVs, both at origination and when updated for today.
On Page 21, home equities, pretty much the same story as mortgages.
I also want to highlight one carat there that close to 50%, 50 of this portfolio is in a first-lien position.
On Slide 22, personal lending, a very small $220 million.
80% of it represents Lending Club.
And as you know, it's about $176.2 million and has been coming down since the peak of about $230 million, $240 million.
On Page 23, in commercial real estate, our total CRE portfolio.
I'll provide more detail on that $3.8 billion representing the 62% you see in the top chart there on the next page.
We've had less office exposure as well than we did 10 years ago.
So we're not talking about 80% loan-to-value real estate loans.
We're talking about a portfolio of 60% loan-to-value real estate loans with an average debt service coverage ratio of nearly two times.
On Page 25, you'll see the C&I portfolio balanced and diversified.
On Page 26, we'll talk about sponsor and specialty and leveraged on these last two pages, and I'll ask Jason to provide a little more color and context.
One of the important things that we always talk about and I'm not sure is fully understood is that our sponsor and specialty business is $3.3 billion or something.
Most of our leveraged loans are in this book over 80%.
We've been lending the sponsor-backed and leveraged companies since 2004 when Chris Motl and I arrived at the bank.
You'll see that software, tech and infrastructure has grown from about one-third of the portfolio to almost 50%, again that's because of the nature of the transactions in the underlying companies, and these companies seem to be less susceptible to this particular crisis as well.
We've maintained discipline on covenants with only 7% of our book being covenant-lite, where the general market is almost 84% covenant-lite.
When we look at the borrower's ability to service debt, we have a very strong profile with 85% to 90% having fixed charge coverage ratios of greater than one and a half times.
And on average for both leveraged and non-leveraged deals in sponsor, our loan-to-value, that's the loan to the enterprise value is between 35% and 40% on average.
We saw that during the 2008 crisis.
When we talk about financing recurring revenue business models, 90% of the exposure in that book has over 70% recurring revenue.
There is only one deal that has less than 50% of recurring revenue in that book, which again represents almost half of the sponsor book.
