In April, NHI received 99.7% of its contractual rent, and so far in May, we have collected approximately 94%, which is in line with our expectations as we typically see a portion of collections through the 15th of the month depending on underlying lease terms.

As Eric mentioned, we had 37 buildings with one or more active resident cases, including 20 senior housing properties and 17 SNFs.
Within the 20 senior housing properties, 14 were need-driven properties and six were discretionary properties.
37 properties span 13 unique operators in 18 different states.
We had a total of 192 active resident cases, which included 97 cases in our SNFs, 40 cases in the skilled nursing wings at our CCRCs and senior living campuses, and 55 cases at our senior housing properties.
Payments from the Provider Relief Fund averaging approximately $150,000 per building, the 2% Medicare sequestration suspension and the 6.2% increase in the FMAP help improve near-term liquidity for the SNFs.
Turning to collections, April collections were 99.7%, and so far in May, we have collected approximately 94%, which is in line with our expectations as we typically see a portion of collections through the 15th of the month depending on the underlying lease terms.

Bickford, which represents 17% of our annualized cash revenue, has seen a slight downtick in their move-out rates, but like much of the industry, their lead volume and tours were down more than 40%, which impacts the rate of new move-ins and occupancy.
Bickford's average occupancy on a same community basis was 87.3% in the first quarter and 86.6% for March.
Occupancy further declined in April by 130 basis points to 85.3%.
Senior living communities, which represents 16% of our revenue had first quarter average occupancy of 80.4%, which ticked up slightly to 80.6% in March, but dropped to 79% in April as multiple entrance fee sales have been delayed due to the pandemic.

The April average occupancy declined by 170 basis points to 85%.
Bickford, SLC and Holiday represent approximately 56% of our senior housing units.
On a combined basis, those three saw average occupancy decline by 150 basis points from March to April, which is a good proxy for the rest of the senior housing portfolio.
The skilled nursing portfolio, which represents 26% of our annualized cash revenue is anchored by two excellent credits in NHC and The Ensign Group.
As of our last weekly update, 17 of our 78 SNFs had active resident cases.
NHC, which accounts for 12% of annualized cash revenue, has received funds from the Provider Relief Fund.
