We made great progress in driving home the understanding that buildings represent approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and there is no tackling climate change without substantial investment in buildings.
With an estimated $195 billion in government stimulus earmarked for K-12 spending, this provides a significant opportunity.
As planned, we launched over 150 new products in fiscal 2021, spanning nearly all business units, resulting in continued share gains in both Q4 and the full year.
In 2022, we are well positioned to gain share with another 175 new products across four main categories: sustainability, smart buildings, digital and residential, with heat pumps central to our product development strategy.
These are just a sample of what is expected to launch over the next 90 days, with a steady pipeline behind us.
Over the last 18 months, we have strengthened our market-leading capabilities to best position ourselves for the shifting industry demographics and evolving digital technologies that are enabling outcome-based solution models.
We exited the year with service revenues up 8% in the fourth quarter with high single-digit growth in all three regions in nearly all business domains.

Service orders were up 7% in Q4 and, importantly, up low single digits organically versus 2019 levels.
Additionally, we improved our attach rate to approximately 40%.
The third pillar is our vectors of growth, which we believe, on a combined basis, represents an incremental market opportunity of $250 billion over the next decade.

Segment EBITA increased 10% versus the prior year, margin expanding 30 basis points to 15.9%.
EPS of $0.88 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 16% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count.

Overall, operations contributed $0.09 versus the prior year, including a $0.04 benefit from our SG&A productivity program, achieving our targeted savings in fiscal '21.
Similar to last quarter, excluding the headwind from the prior year temporary actions, underlying incrementals in Q4 were approximately 30%.
Corporate was a $0.03 headwind year-over-year and other items netted to a $0.06 tailwind, primarily related to lower share count, lower net financing charges and FX.
North America revenue grew 4% organically, led by strength in services, which was higher in all domain.
Segment margin decreased 20 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, primarily due to the reversal of temporary cost from the mitigation actions in the prior year.

Light Commercial grew high single digits overall, with North America unitary equipment down 2% and VRF up high single digits.

On a full year basis, we expect high single-digit organic revenue growth, with 70 to 80 basis points of segment EBITA margin expansion.
Although we expect to remain price/cost positive on an earnings per share basis, the inflated level of pricing will result in margin headwinds of approximately 40 basis points for the year.
