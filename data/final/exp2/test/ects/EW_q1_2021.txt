Also earlier this month, we received approval to begin treating patients at low surgical risk in Japan with SAPIEN 3.
In fact, we recently converted one of our facilities into a mass COVID vaccination site to support the community of 3 million people, where our company is headquartered.
We reported $1.2 billion in sales this quarter, up 5% on a constant currency basis from a year ago.
In TAVR, first quarter global sales were $792 million, up 4% on an underlying basis.
The SAPIEN 3 Ultra platform remains differentiated with low complication rates, ease of use and significant potential for length of stay efficiency.
As previously noted, we received approval earlier this month in Japan for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk.
Separately, last week, we received SAPIEN 3 CE Mark approval to begin treating patients with a previously repaired or replaced valve in the pulmonic position.
Looking ahead to the upcoming virtual EuroPCR meeting next month, we expect long-term follow-up data from our European Registry on SAPIEN 3 as well as the late-breaking clinical trial results on low risk bicuspid patients.
In summary, based on the strength we saw at the end of the first quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow in the 15% to 20% range in 2021.
We remain confident that this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digits.
This study will evaluate the safety and performance of EVOQUE Eos, which is designed to advance the treatment of patients with mitral regurgitation with low profile valve delivered through a sub-30 French transfemoral delivery system.
First quarter global sales were $16 million, driven by continued adoption of our PASCAL system and activation of more centers across Europe.
We remain confident in our 2021 sales guidance of $80 million as we advance commercialization, staying focused on physician training, procedural success and patient outcomes.
In summary, we are making meaningful progress toward our 2021 milestones and we continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach approximately $3 billion by 2025.
In Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter 2021 global sales was $213 million, increased 7% on an underlying basis over the prior year.
We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structural Heart market will grow in the mid-single digits through 2026.
In Critical Care, first quarter sales of $196 million increased 4% on an underlying basis, driven by increased sales of technologies for both the operating room and intensive care units.
Total sales grew 5% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was better than the flat growth we expected when we gave guidance for the first quarter back in January.
This stronger-than-expected sales performance fell through to the bottom line, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, which was 8% higher than the first quarter of 2020.
While macro conditions remain variable across our key geographies, we're projecting total sales in the second quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.25 billion and $1.33 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.60.
For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion; for TAVR, $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion; for TMTT, approximately $80 million; for Surgical Structural Heart, $800 million to $900 million; and for Critical Care, $725 million to $800 million.
And based on our first quarter earnings, we are raising full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $2.07 to $2.27, up from $2 to $2.20.
For the first quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 76% compared to 76.7% in the same period last year.

Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 10% to $207 million or 17% of sales.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT.
Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1%.
We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 4 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.
Foreign exchange rates increased first quarter reported sales growth by 280 basis points or $30 million compared to the prior year.
At current rates, we now expect an approximate $60 million positive impact or about 1% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020.
FX rates negatively impacted our first quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year.
Relative to our January guidance, FX rates positively impacted our first quarter earnings per share by about $0.01.
