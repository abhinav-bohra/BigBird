The yield curve does continue to surreptitiously steepen as the 10-year backed up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter and another almost 45 since year end.
With two 10s at approximately 125 basis points, this hardly qualifies as a steep yield curve by historical standards, but it has steepened by about 45 basis points since the end of the year.
I do have to smile a little when I hear this recent chatter about higher rates, however, with 10s yielding 135 as 10s were above 3% less than two and a half years ago.
Yes, we're off the lows at least for 10 years, but let's not kid ourselves.

We reported GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter.
On the other hand, fourth-quarter earnings were reduced by expenses related to the acceleration of discount in connection with our payoff of the $500 million, 11% Apollo/Athene senior note in September and October.
And the overall dilution associated with these transactions was less than 4%.
Obviously, our GAAP book value would have been up by approximately 2.4% for the quarter had it not been for these warrants.
Economic book value also negatively impacted by 3.9% by the warrants was nevertheless unchanged at $4.92 during the fourth quarter as our loans held at carrying value appreciated further.
We repurchased 14.1 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of a little over $50 million during the quarter at an average price of less than 80% of September 30 GAAP book value and less than 75% of economic book value.
Our leverage declined modestly over the quarter to 1.7:1, primarily due to the payoff of the Apollo/Athene debt.
And we paid $0.075 dividend to shareholders on January 29.

These sales totaled over $270 million for the year and were executed at prices well above our carrying value.
We believe that the hard work that we've done since emerging from forbearance at the end of June has benefited stockholders as our total shareholder return was 62% from June 30 to December 31.
We did add $111 million of loans in the fourth quarter.
On the financing side, you can see that 67% of our asset-based financing is non mark to market.
With the SFR securitization that we closed at the beginning of February, this is now over 70%.

Again, continuing the theme of aggressively taking advantage of available market opportunities, we've executed three additional securitizations on $1.2 billion of UPB at successively tighter levels.
As you can see on this page, AAA yields on bonds sold on the most recent two deals were below 1%, and the blended cost of debt sold was in the low ones and was in some cases almost 200 basis points lower than the cost of borrowing we replaced.
Bonds sold generated cash of between 91% and 94% of UPB, which also produced approximately $250 million of additional liquidity.

Page 8 provides the details of the repurchase and exercise of the previously outstanding warrant position.
Through a straight repurchase of warrants on December 10 for $33.7 million.
In an exercise through a combination of cash and cashless exercise on December 28, we were able to limit the dilution of warrants granted, which was 7.5% at the time of grant to less than 4%.
Apollo/Athene holds 12.3 million shares or about 2.7% of outstanding shares, and we continue to maintain a strong partnership with both Apollo and Athene.

We announced on our third-quarter earnings call that our board had authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program and we executed this during the open-window period in the fourth quarter by purchasing 14.1 million shares at an average price of $3.61, which was accretive to GAAP and economic book value by $0.03 and $0.04, respectively.
In addition, the $33.7 warrant repurchase was included under this plan.
So, all in, we deployed almost $85 million during the quarter and still have $165 million available under this authorization.

We announced the redemption of our $100 million 8% senior notes due in 2042.
These $25 par bonds were issued in 2012.
This redemption, which was completed shortly after year end will save $8 million in annual interest expense.
We did book a noncash charge of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter for unamortized issuance expenses.
These $25 par bonds were sold primarily to retail investors, similar to 20 firms, and hence, the relatively high issuance expense.

We were recognized as one of 380 public companies across 44 countries and regions for our commitment to and support of gender equality.
Net income to common shareholders was $37.6 million or $0.08 per share.
Net income includes $25.3 million or $0.06 per common share of expenses recognized on the repayment of the senior secured term loan from Apollo/Athene.
Recall that as we elected to account for this financing at fair value, GAAP required us to allocate a portion of the day 1 loan-to-value or approximately $14 million of the associated warrants.
This was recorded in shareholders' equity, while the residual loan value of approximately $481 million is recorded on our balance sheet as a liability.
Specifically, the key items impacting our results are as follows: net interest income for Q4 was $19.4 million, almost double Q3, and it reflects the following.
The payoff of the senior secured debt resulted in high net interest income by approximately $12 million.
And as Craig noted, we redeemed our 8% senior notes early in January '21.
Q4 net interest expense includes a noncash charge of $3.1 million for unamortized deferred expenses that we incurred when this debt was originally issued in 2012.
In addition, future quarterly interest expense will be $2 million lower as a result of this note redemption.
I would also note that since exiting forbearance in June, we have lowered our cost of funds across our entire portfolio by 140 basis points to 3.1% December 31, 2020, and this falls even further to 2.9% with the senior note redemption.
Also, we reduced our overall CECL allowance in our current value loans to $86.8 million, primarily reflecting lower estimates of future unemployment used for credit loss modeling purposes, but also partially due to lower loan balances.
This reversal and other net adjustments to our CECL reserves positively impacted net income for the quarter by approximately $16 million.
After the initial significant increase in CECL reserves taken in Q1 and uncertainty related to COVID-19 economic impacts were at the highest, we have reduced our CECL reserves by almost $60 million in the past three quarters.
Actual charge-off experience to date remains very modest, with less than $2.5 million of net charge-offs taken in 2020.
Net gains of $49.8 million were recorded, including $30.9 million of market value increases and $18.9 million of interest payments, liquidation gains, and other cash income.
Finally, our operating and other expenses were $20.4 million for the quarter.
We continue to estimate that annualized G&A expenses to equity should run at about 2% each quarter.

We were able to purchase approximately $80 million in the fourth quarter and are on track to purchase over $100 million in the first two months of 2021.
We executed on two additional securitizations in the fourth quarter, bringing the amount of collateral securitized in 2020 to approximately $1.25 billion.
Securitization, combined with non-mark-to-market term -- a non-mark-to-market term facility, has resulted in over 75% of our non-QM portfolio financed with non-mark-to-market leverage.

Through our services, we granted almost 32% of the portfolio temporary payment relief, which, we believe, helps put our borrowers in a better position for long-term payment performance.
In addition, approximately 30% of delinquent loans made a payment in December.
Turning to Page 15.
Our RPL portfolio of $1.1 billion has been impacted by the pandemic but continues to perform well.
81% of our portfolio remains less than 60 days delinquent.
And although the percentage for the portfolio 60 days delinquent in status is 19%, over 24% of those borrowers continue to make payments.
And while 30% of our RPL borrowers were impacted by COVID, we have worked with our servicers to provide assistance to borrowers and have seen improvement in delinquency levels over the quarter.
Turning to Page 16.
36% of loans that were delinquent at purchase are now either performing or paid in full.
45% have either liquidated or REO to be liquidated.
We have significantly increased our activity, liquidating REO properties, selling 87% more properties as compared to a year ago.
19% are still in nonperforming status.

This, combined with the seasoned nature of our portfolio, currently at weighted average loan rates of 17 months, led to us receiving $141 million of principal payments in the fourth quarter and a total of approximately $650 million for all of 2020.
MSA's fix-and-flip portfolio declined $118 million to $581 million in UPB at the end of the fourth quarter.
Principal paydowns were $141 million, which is equivalent to a quarterly paydown rate of 59 CPR on an annualized basis.
We advanced about $11 million of rehab draws and converted $3 million to REO.
We began purchasing fix-and-flip loans again in the fourth quarter and acquired approximately $15 million UPB of new loans in the quarter.
The average yield for the fix-and-flip portfolio in the fourth quarter was 5.97%.
All of our fix-and-flip financing is non-mark-to-market debt with the remaining term of 18 months.
After declining by approximately $40 million in the third quarter, the total amount of seriously delinquent fix-and-flip loans increased $19 million in the fourth quarter to $162 million.
Loan loss reserves declined by $4 million to approximately $18 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Turning to Page 18.
Seriously delinquent fix-and-flip loans increased $19 million in the quarter to $162 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
In the quarter, we saw $25 million of loans paid off in full, $3 million cured to current of 30 days delinquent pay status, and $3 million of loans converted to REO, while $50 million became new 60-plus day delinquent loans.
In addition, approximately 15% of the seriously delinquent loans are already listed for sale potentially shortening the time until resolution.
Since inception, we have collected approximately $2.6 million in these types of fees across our fix-and-flip portfolio.
Turning to Page 19.
The portfolio yielded 5.27% in the quarter.
When including those, the SFR portfolio yield was 5.99% in the fourth quarter.
Prepayments increased in the quarter to a three-month CPR of 33%.
60-plus state delinquencies increased modestly in the quarter to 5.6%.
We resumed our acquisition of rental loans in the fourth quarter and purchased $12 million of loans in the quarter.
Approximately $218 million of loans were securitized.
We sold approximately 91% of the bonds at a weighted average coupon of 106 basis points.
This transaction lowers the funding rate of the underlying asset by over 150 basis points and increases the percentage of SFR financing that is non mark to market to 77%, up 54% from 23% at the end of the fourth quarter.
