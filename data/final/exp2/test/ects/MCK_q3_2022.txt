We also now anticipate diluted weighted shares outstanding to range from 154 million to 155 million for fiscal 2022.
This includes the impact of the anticipated $1.5 billion of fourth quarter share repurchases mentioned earlier.
As a result of our strong year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are raising and narrowing our previous adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $23.55 to $23.95, which is above our previous range of $22.35 to $22.95.
