Total revenue for the quarter was $139.6 million versus $3.9 million in the prior year.
Additionally, we had higher other income and other expense of $7.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively, due primarily to the reopening of the Kartrite Resort and indoor water park after being closed due to COVID restrictions, COVID-19 restrictions, as well as the operations from two theater properties.
Percentage rents for the quarter totaled $3.1 million versus $1.3 million in the prior year.
Costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff for the quarter of $4.7 million related to the write-off of fees and termination of interest rate swaps related to the repayment of our $400 million unsecured term loan facility during the quarter.
Interest expense net for the quarter decreased by $5.2 million compared to prior year due to reduced borrowings offset by lower interest income on short-term investments.
You may recall that in prior year, we had drawn $750 million on our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure which provide us with additional liquidity during the early days of the pandemic.
During the quarter, we continued to see improvement in the credit profile of our mortgage notes and notes receivable, resulting in a credit loss benefit of $14.1 million versus a loss of $5.7 million in the prior year.
The primary reason for the benefit this quarter was stronger-than-expected performance by a borrower, resulting in a partial repayment of $5.3 million on a fully reserved note and the release from an additional $8.5 million in funding commitments that also had been previously reserved.
Lastly, income tax expense was $395,000 for the quarter versus $18.4 million in the prior year.

The offering was over 4.5 times subscribed, which allowed us to significantly tighten pricing and achieve a negative 5 basis points new issue concession.
As previously announced, the proceeds from this offering will be used in part to redeem all $275 million of our 5.25% senior unsecured notes at the make-whole amount on November 12.
Our net debt to gross assets was 38% on a book basis at September 30.

We had $144.4 million of cash on hand at quarter end, which is expected to increase by approximately $95 million with the issuance of the new 10-year bonds net of the redemption of the 2023 bonds, and we have nothing drawn on our $1 billion revolver.
Cash collections from customers continue to exceed expectations and were approximately 90% of contractual cash revenue were $124.5 million for the third quarter.
During the quarter, we also collected $7.7 million of deferred rent and interest from accrual basis tenants and borrowers and the deferred rent and interest receivable on our books at September 30 was $40.9 million, which we expect to collect primarily over the next 27 months.
Additionally, during the quarter, we collected $3.6 million in deferral repayments from cash basis customers that were recognized as revenue when received.
At September 30, we had about $126 million of deferred rent and interest owed to us not on the books.
However, most of this amount is scheduled to begin to be collected over about 60 months beginning in May of 2022.
Finally, as discussed previously, we also received a note repayment from a cash basis customer of $5.3 million, which resulted in credit loss recovery that is excluded from FFO as adjusted.
Adding this all together, and as you can see on the slide, we collected more than 100% of contractual cash revenue for the quarter.
We are pleased to be increasing guidance for 2021 FFO as adjusted per share from a range of $2.76 to $2.86 to a range of $2.95 to $3.01.
The guidance for 2021 FFO as adjusted per share includes only previously committed additional investment spending of approximately $6 million for the last three months of 2021.
Guidance for disposition proceeds has also been increased from $40 million to $50 million to $93 million to $103 million, primarily to reflect the sale of the two ski properties that Greg discussed.
The range we expect to recognize in Q4 of such contractual cash revenue is $133 million to $138 million or 96% to 99%.
Additionally, the expected range we expect to collect of such contractual cash revenue in Q4 is $131 million to $135 million or 95% to 97%.
I would also like to note that beginning in 2022, we expect both current quarter collections and revenue recognition to be at 100% of contractual cash revenue, and we expect to continue to collect deferral amounts from prior periods.
Finally, I thought it would be helpful to provide a bridge from the midpoint of our previous FFO as adjusted per share guidance of $2.81 to the midpoint of our increased guidance of $2.98.
Details regarding all of our 2021 guidance can be found on page 22 of our supplemental.
