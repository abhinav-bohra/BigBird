We delivered broad-based market outgrowth and share gains in each of our segments and business units, with total enterprise organic revenues up 11%, while at the same time delivering more than 400 basis points of margin expansion in every segment and for the enterprise as a whole.
We delivered double-digit bookings growth in all segments, growing our backlog over 30% sequentially versus December 2020 and up more than 30% versus our already strong backlog at the end of 2019 heading into 2020.
Adjusted earnings growth was also exceptional, up 135%.
Although it's still early in the year and overall visibility remains limited, our strong quarter 1 performance, growing backlog, improving markets and asterism for improved vaccination rates gives us confidence to raise our full year 2021 guidance for both revenue and adjusted earnings per share above the high end of the prior ranges.
We also continue to make excellent progress toward our transformation savings goal of $300 million by 2023 and expect to realize approximately $190 million in total savings in 2021.
That's up from $100 million in 2020.
We've raised our capital deployment expectations for 2021 by $500 million from approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion to continue our commitment of deploying 100% effective cash overtime.
We also have revised our annual incentive compensation plan for approximately 2,300 leaders beginning this year to link directly to ESG metrics, including both carbon emission reduction, and advancing diversity and inclusion.
In addition, all salaried employees must now include at least 1 sustainability-related goal in their annual performance plans.
We delivered robust organic bookings growth of 31% in the first quarter.
Our Americas segment delivered growth in both bookings and revenue, up 36% and 9%, respectively.
The residential HVAC markets remain robust and our residential HVAC team delivered strong revenue growth, well in excess of 30% in the quarter as they once again grew market share.
Turning to EMEA, our team's delivered 18% bookings growth in the quarter, with strong growth in both commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration.
Revenues were also strong, up 12%.
EMEA transport bookings were up over 20% in the quarter and revenues are up high single digits, outperforming the broader transport markets.
Our Asia Pacific team delivered bookings growth of 14% and revenue growth of 34% in the quarter, laughing a soft Q1 2020 that was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Adjusted EBITDA margins were strong up 460 basis points, driving adjusted earnings per share growth of 135%.
In the Americas region, market outgrowth, cost containment, productivity and price drove solid EBITDA margin expansion of 400 basis points.
Likewise, the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions delivered strong market outgrowth, productivity and cost containment to improve EBITDA margins by 540 basis points, and 1,160 basis points, respectively versus 2020.
To-date we've engaged with many of our K-12 customers to perform indoor air quality assessments in anticipation of the time when Federal stimulus funds will be made available.
End market indicators are improving with ABI over 50 and both February and March, both positives for the road ahead.
All-in, we expect 26% weighted average market growth for the year, reiterating our prior outlook.
Transport markets, in particular, are expecting approximately 8% market growth, given the current rates of economic improvement, reiterating our prior outlook.
As Mike indicated earlier, we expect to deliver a strong organic financial performance with organic revenue growth of approximately 9%, up from our previous guidance of between 5% in 7%.
We expect to deliver strong organic leverage over 35% for the full year, with organic leverage of approximately 30% for the balance of the year.
We continue to see about 1.5 points of revenue growth from the channel acquisitions, we announced last quarter, which will carry about five points of operating margin and deliver earnings per share accretion of about $0.05.
All-in, total revenue growth is expected to be approximately 10.5%, and adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $6, which translates to approximately 35% earnings growth versus 2020.
We expect free cash flow to remain strong and equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income.
Net each point from FX would translate into about $0.05 of EPS.

As we outlined during our investor event in December, by transforming Trane Technologies, we initially identified $100 million of fixed cost reductions by 2021.
We've exceeded our initial cost reduction expectations, delivering $100 million of savings in 2020, a full year early.
And we expect to deliver a $90 million of incremental savings for a total of $190 million in savings in 2021.
We are now targeting and are on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings by 2023.
Third, we invest another significant portion of the savings into an improved cost structure, which drives the fourth element, improved and sustainable incremental margins at or above 25% over the mid to long term.
Please go to slide number 11.
All in, we expect to consistently deploy a 100% of excess cash over time.
And have increased our capital deployment target to approximately $2.5 billion, a $500 million increase to our prior guidance.
We anticipate deploying the additional $500 million between value accretive M&A and share repurchases, taking the total target for M&A and share repurchases to approximately $1.5 billion for the year.
In the first quarter, we raised our dividend by 11%, deployed $174 million to M&A and share repurchases and paid down $300 million of debt.
We plan to retire an additional $125 million in debt as it reaches maturity in the third quarter of 2021, taking the total debt retirement to $425 million for the year.
This guidance increase reflects our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, our commitment to deploying 100% of excess cash over time and our continued confidence in our ability to deliver powerful free cash flow to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy.

The net takeaway is that our outlook for 2021 is largely unchanged from our prior outlook, where we highlighted that we expect to see approximately 26% weighted average market growth for transport Americas, and approximately 8% weighted average market growth for transport EMEA.
While ACT has raised their outlook slightly on North America trailers, about 1% from 39% growth to 40% growth, they modestly lowered their outlook for truck, which nets out to be a wash on total growth.
The other element I wanted to highlight for transport North America is that, ACT has increased their trailer forecast for fiscal year 2022 to 51,100 units, which represents an increase of about 13% over their 2021 forecast.
The North America trailer market took a step-up in 2015 and has been above 40,000 units ever since with only one exception, 2020.
The driver logs, driver shortage and added economic activity appears to have fundamentally shifted the market to new levels above 40,000 units, excluding economic disruption.
ACT's forecast for 2023 is also at the mid-40,000 unit level.
If they are correct in their forecast for 2021 through 2023, it will be eight of nine years where the North America trailer market has been in the mid-40,000 unit range, plus or minus 10%.
We are on track to deliver $300 million in savings that will continue to improve the cost structure of the company and enable additional reinvestment to expand margins and further strengthen our ability to outgrow our end markets.
When combined with the long-term sustainability megatrends underpinning our end markets, our exceptional ability to generate free cash flow and balanced capital deployment of 100% of excess cash over time, we are well positioned to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns.
