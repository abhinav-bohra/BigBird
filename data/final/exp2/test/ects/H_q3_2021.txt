In the span of just two quarters, our quarterly adjusted EBITDA has improved $130 million, recovering to nearly 70% of 2019 levels in the third quarter.
RevPAR in the third quarter continued to recover at a robust pace, accelerating nearly 30% compared to the second quarter and doubling RevPAR levels in the first quarter.
As discussed on our last earnings call, we experienced a wave of leisure demand during the summer with systemwide RevPAR eclipsing $100 in July, which was approximately 75% recovered as compared to 2019.
As we moved into August, RevPAR decelerated by approximately 10% as compared to July driven by seasonality, coupled with reimposed travel restrictions in certain markets related to the Delta variant.
Absolute RevPAR in October is nearly as strong as July at $98.
What is encouraging is that the recovery has broadened, whereas our strength in July was primarily driven by resort locations, the improvement more recently has been from urban locations, which experienced RevPAR growth of 10% in October as compared to July.
Systemwide Leisure Transient revenue was at 96% of fully recovered levels in the third quarter, an incredible performance when considering the significant restrictions that were still prevalent in many parts of the world.
Strong leisure transient demand is proving to be far more than the summer surge as Leisure Transient revenue booked in October for all periods was over 20% ahead of 2019 levels.
Further, total transient revenue at our Americas resorts is pacing 25% ahead of 2019 levels for the last weeks of December.
Overall, systemwide group revenue jumped 16% in October as compared to September and is trending at 50% of fully recovered levels.
In October, our leads for 2022 grew by 38% as compared to September, and we're now 10% ahead of 2019 levels for group business that is likely to book.
While group pace for 2022 is approximately 80% recovered, a bit weaker than what we reported last quarter.
As for business transient, the recovery has been softer than group, but is still showing steady momentum with demand recovering to 46% of 2019 levels in October.
Our largest corporate accounts have grown by 50% since June and we continue to be encouraged by dialogue with our corporate customers who are returning to offices in bigger numbers with many planning on a more robust return to travel in 2022.
We're also seeing occupancy of 70% in the Middle East, which is similar to 2019 levels, driven by very strong demand from the Dubai Expo, which kicked off in October and runs through March of 2022.
Lastly, occupancy in India, which was below 20% just a few months ago due to the Delta variant, is now trending at almost 60% as we exit October.
Our net rooms growth was 6.9% in the third quarter, again, leading the industry with notable openings, including the Thompson Hollywood, the Park Hyatt Toronto and the Hyatt Ziva Riviera Cancun.
And our pipeline at 103,000 rooms again expanded from the prior quarter, represents an industry-leading 41% of our existing property portfolio.
ALG now as part of Hyatt, immediately doubles the number of resorts in our portfolio, increases our European footprint by more than 60% and positions us as the world's largest operator of hotels in the fast-growing luxury all-inclusive resort segment.
Further, we expect it to increase our systemwide stabilized leisure transient revenue mix to over [50%].
In 2021, ALG through the AMR collection is expected to finish the year with net rooms growth of 35% with the addition of 31 hotels and approximately 8,500 rooms and taking the AMR collection to 101 hotels in total with 33,000 rooms by the end of 2021.
In August, at the same time, as the acquisition announcement, we committed to a $2 billion expansion of our asset disposition commitment.
We've realized over $3 billion in proceeds since our original announcement in 2017 at a very attractive multiple, and we have a high quality and a highly desirable asset base that remains on our balance sheet today.
As a reminder, the $3 billion commitment was in two parts, $1.5 billion in 2017 and an additional $1.5 billion in 2019.
During September, we completed the sale of two assets, the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe and Alila Ventana Big Sur, for approximately $500 million in gross proceeds and reached cumulatively over $3 billion in total gross proceeds from asset sales since 2017 at an average aggregate multiple of 17.4 times.
In summary, we look forward to continuing our track record of realizing proceeds in excess of the valuation implied by the multiple for Hyatt and simultaneously transforming our earnings mix to an expected 80% fee-based proportion by the end of 2024.
Late yesterday, we reported a third quarter net income attributable to Hyatt of $120 million and a diluted earnings per share of $1.15 with our results favorably impacted by gains on the sale of real estate of $307 million.
Adjusted EBITDA was $110 million in the third quarter effectively doubling our adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter, again demonstrating our ability to translate improving demand into a strong increase in earnings.
In a RevPAR environment that is improving but still challenging, we were able to narrow our adjusted EBITDA decline to only 32% in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019, which is the same as our systemwide RevPAR decline of 32%.
Additionally, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.4% for the third quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.9% we reported in the third quarter of 2019, serving as yet another marker of operating excellence in a lower demand environment.
Systemwide RevPAR was $94 in the third quarter, representing a 29% increase compared to second quarter.
Both occupancy and rate contributed to the sequential growth with occupancy improving by 700 basis points and rate growing by 12%.
The improvement in rate is especially notable as it reached 96% of 2019 levels on a systemwide basis.
Our base incentive and franchise fees totaled $96 million in third quarter reaching 71% of 2019 levels, with base and franchise fees more fully recovered than RevPAR as a result of our strong net rooms growth over the past two years.
Our management and franchising business delivered a combined adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, improving 33% from the second quarter.
The Americas segment accounted for the vast majority of the sequential growth and recovered to approximately 80% of 2019 segment adjusted EBITDA levels.
Mainland China RevPAR had a strong start to the quarter trending 4% ahead of 2019 levels in July before dropping to less than 50% of 2019 levels in August due to reimposed travel restrictions.
Demand has improved since with RevPAR strengthening to 78% of 2019 levels in October.
The business delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter representing an improvement of $39 million from the second quarter.
Owned and leased RevPAR was $117 for the third quarter, improving 39% from the second quarter with notable improvement from group revenue, which jumped 87% sequentially and accounted for over 28% of the room night mix.
This is quite notable considering group business accounted for approximately 70% of the rooms revenue mix for these hotels during the third quarter of 2019.
This year, these hotels were still able to generate a significant amount of group business, representing 57% of rooms revenue and we're also able to grow transient revenue nearly 30% above 2019 levels through creative tactics such as repositioning the hotels for families and other leisure business.
Comparable operating margins were 20.3% in the third quarter, which is an improvement of 490 basis points relative to 2019 levels despite RevPAR that was only 75% recovered.
As of September 30, our total liquidity inclusive of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and combined with revolver borrowing capacity was approximately $4.3 billion compared with $3.2 billion as of June 30.
We received a USD254 million tax refund in July, $491 million of net proceeds from the sale of Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe and Alila Ventana Big Sur, and raised $575 million in net proceeds from our equity offering in September.
We also repaid $250 million in senior notes that matured in August.
In October, we raised $1.75 billion of short-term 2- and 3-year fixed and floating rate notes at an approximate weighted average interest rate of 1.48%.
We used $750 million of those proceeds to refinance our 2022 short-term prepayable bonds and successfully reduced our interest costs by $12 million annually on the refinancing.
Our approximate total liquidity after the debt capital markets proceeds was $5.2 billion at the end of October.
On November 1, we closed on the acquisition of ALG and paid cash of $2.7 billion.
After the acquisition and as of today, our total liquidity position remains strong at approximately $2.6 billion, with $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $1.3 billion available under the revolver.
Consistent with our communication in the second quarter, we continue to expect adjusted SG&A to be in the approximate range of $240 million, excluding any bad debt expense or ALG integration costs.
We're still refining the ALG integration cost estimate but expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million for the full year of 2021 with $2 million of that amount already included in the third quarter adjusted SG&A.
We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2021 to be approximately $110 million exclusive of any impact from ALG.
We are reaffirming our expectation of rooms growth to be greater than 6% for the full year, exclusive of any impact from ALG.
However, greater than 6% remains our best estimate at this time and we're pleased to be delivering another very strong year of net rooms growth.
