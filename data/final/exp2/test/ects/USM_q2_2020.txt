As you can see on Slide 5, at June 30th, TDS had $1.7 billion in available funding sources, including cash and cash equivalents, available credit facilities, undrawn term loans and the undrawn portions of our EIP securitization.
We also repurchased a little over 500,000 TDS common shares at favorable prices during the quarter, balancing the need to retain liquidity with a pricing opportunity offered by the market.
I'm so proud to have worked for TDS and U.S. Cellular for over 30 years, by my count -- actually, by Jane's count.
I've been involved in reporting for some 136 quarters, with many of you on the receiving end of some those, maybe even many of those or maybe just feeling that way.
Phase two will begin in the second half of 2020 and we will deploy in 11 states or about 10 million PoPs.
Recently, store traffic has been running about 20% below prior year levels.
We had about 56,000 subscribers sign up for the pledge with 39,000 remaining at June 30th.
Overall, despite some negative impacts to revenue and expenses as a result of the pandemic, we continue to control cash expenses, which decreased 3% year-over-year.
To-date, COVID-19 has increased data traffic about 20%-25% and our network has been able to handle that extra demand.
Total smartphone connections increased by 11,000 during the quarter and by 64,000 over the course of the past 12 months that helps to drive more service revenue given that smartphone ARPU is about $21 higher than feature phone ARPU.
As mentioned, we saw connected device gross additions increased by 9,000 year-over-year.
During Q2, we saw an average decline in store traffic of around 35% with the larger drop in traffic at the beginning of the quarter and the end of the quarter.
Postpaid handset churn depicted by the blue bars was 0.71%, down from 0.97% a year ago.
Postpaid churn combining handsets and connected devices was 0.89% for the second quarter of 2020 also lower than a year ago.
Total operating revenues for the second quarter were $973 million, flat year-over-year.
Retail service revenues decreased by $4 million to $658 million.
Inbound roaming revenue was $41 million that was a decrease of $3 million year-over-year driven by lower rates, partially offset by higher data volume.
Other service revenues were $54 million, that was an increase of $3 million year-over-year attributable to a 16% increase in tower rental revenues.
Finally, equipment sales revenues increased by $4 million or 2% year-over-year due to the increase in devices sold, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price and a decrease in accessory sales.
Average revenue per user or connection was $46.24 for the second quarter, up $0.34 or approximately 1% year-over-year.
At a per account basis, average revenue grew by $1.24 or 1% year-over-year.
As shown at the bottom of the slide, adjusted operating income was $235 million, an increase of $23 million year-over-year.
As I commented earlier, total operating revenues were $973 million, flat year-over-year.
Total cash expenses were $738 million, decrease in $23 million year-over-year.
Excluding roaming expense, system operations expense increased by 3%, mainly driven by increases in cell site rent expense and non-capitalized cost to add network capacity, while total data usage on our network increased by 72%.
Roaming expense decreased 2% year-over-year due to lower rates, partially offset by a 42% increase in off-net data usage.
Cost of equipment sold decreased by $6 million or 3% year-over-year, primarily due to a lower average cost per device, a decrease in accessory sales and a decrease in charges recorded to reduce inventory to its net realizable value.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 6% year-over-year, driven by a decrease in bad debts expense, advertising and employee-related expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $280 million, a 9% increase year-over-year due to the improvement in adjusted operating income as well as an increase in equity and earnings of unconsolidated entities, partially offset by a decrease in interest income.
For total service revenues, we have maintained a range of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion.
We have also maintained our adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA ranges of $725 million to $850 million and $900 million to $1.025 billion respectively.
For capital expenditures, we are maintaining our guidance range of $850 million to $950 million.
As a result of both these actions, we recorded a reserve of $2 million in the quarter.
In advance of processing non-pay disconnect, which we began in July, early indications suggested about 70% of our customers are prioritizing their services and making arrangements to stay connected.
Consolidated revenues increased 3% from the prior year, primarily due to the cable acquisition, which closed at the end of last year.
Cash expenses increased 2%, including the acquisition and were flat without.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $83 million due to these increases in operations, partially offset by lower interest income in the quarter.
Capital expenditures increased 7% to $75 million as we continued to invest in our fiber deployment.
Broadband residential connections grew 6% as we continue to fortify our network with fiber and expand into new market.
From a broadband speed perspective, we are now offering up to 1 gig broadband speeds in our fiber markets.
Across our wireline residential base, essentially, one-third of all broadband customers are now taking 100 megabit speeds or greater compared to 26% a year ago.
This is helping to drive a 4% increase in average residential revenue per connection in the quarter.
Wireline residential video connections grew 9% compared to the prior year.
Video is important to our customers, approximately 40% of our broadband customers in our IPTV market take video, which for us is a profitable product.
As a result of this strategy over the last several years, 265,000 or 33% of our wireline serviced addresses are now served by fiber, which is up from 27% a year ago.
This is driving revenue growth, while also expanding the total wireline footprint 3% to 810,000.
Our current fiber plans include roughly 320,000 serviced addresses that will be built over a multi-year period.
Year-to-date, we have completed construction of 25,000 fiber addresses, and overall take rates are generally exceeding expectations in these areas that we've launched to-date.
Total revenues decreased 2% to $169 million, largely driven by the continued decline in CLEC commercial revenues and a decline in wholesale revenues.
These declines in commercial and wholesale revenues are offsetting strong growth in residential revenue, which increased 6% due to growth from video and broadband connections as well as growth from within the broadband product mix, partially offset by a 3% decrease in residential voice connection.
Commercial revenues decreased 10% to $38 million in the quarter, primarily driven by lower CLEC connections.
Wholesale revenues decreased 6% to $46 million due to retroactive ATM[Phonetic] funding in 2019 and decreased access revenue.
Wireline cash expenses decreased 2%, this was driven by lower employee expenses, the capitalization of new modems, previously expensed and reduced cost of legacy services, partially offset by higher video programming fee.
In total, wireline adjusted EBITDA decreased 4% to $59 million.
Total cable connections grew 12% to 378,000, while -- which included 31,000 from the acquisition and a 9% organic increase in total broadband connections.
On an organic basis, broadband penetration continued to increase, up 220 basis points to 46%.
On Slide 25, total cable revenues increased 16% to $71 million, driven in part by the acquisition.
Without the acquisition, cable revenues grew 7%, driven by growth in broadband connections from both residential and commercial customers.
Our focus on broadband connection growth and fast reliable service has generated a 25% increase in total residential broadband revenue, including organic growth of $4 million or 15%.
Also driving the revenue change is a 6% increase in average residential revenue per connection, driven by higher value product mix and price increases.
Cash expenses increased 13%, due primarily to costs related to the acquisition, or 4% excluding acquisition due to increased employee expense to support the growth.
As a result, cable adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $24 million in the quarter, improving margin by 130 basis points to 34%.
