We had releasing spreads of 5% and occupancy at nearly 91%.
During the third quarter, our average rent collections were 80%.
October is trending above 80%.
As of today, we have significant liquidity and currently have approximately $675 million of cash on the balance sheet.
By October, for centers opened at least eight weeks, sales were up to 90% of pre-COVID levels.
Looking at traffic, in general, it's running about 80% compared to a year ago.
Sales, on the other hand, are running on average 90% of a year ago, which means there, I'd say, higher capture rate.
It is known as Proposition 15.
That proposition would have removed the protection of Prop 13 from commercial properties in California.
For us, generally, we structure our leases to pass-through taxes to the tenant as a recoverable expense with a significant bottom line impact that the [Inaudible] shows Prop 15 passing.
The yes votes stand at 48.7%, the no are at 51.3%.
Although we are still in the midst of COVID, our centers are operating at 90% capacity, sales levels of 90% pre-COVID.
And even if you look at one of the more challenging categories, restaurants, in our portfolio, we have 247 restaurants and 94% of those are open today.
The impact on reserves for adoption accounts was less than 20 — second quarter of '20, but still much higher than normal.
Funds from operations for the third quarter was $0.52 per share, down from the third quarter of 2019 at $0.88 per share.
Same-center net operating income for the quarter was down 29%, and year to date, it was down 17%.
Changes between the third quarter of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2019 were driven primarily by the following factors and the numbers I'm going to cover [Inaudible] for the company: One, $20 million — $21 million in bad debt allowance in the form of the $14 million of increased net debt expense versus the third quarter of 2019, coupled with $7 million of lease revenue reverse for tenants, that are accounted for on a cash basis per GAAP within the third quarter; two, over $20 million of short-term nonrecurring rental assistance; three, a $9 million decline in common area and ancillary revenue as well as percentage rents; four, a $4 million decline in parking income driven by protracted property closures and reduced parking utilization at our urban centers in New York City and Chicago primarily; five, interest expense increased $4 million due to a decline in capitalized interest; six, net operating income declined from the Hyatt Regency Hotel [Inaudible], it was about a $2 million decline; seven, a negative $0.03 per share dilutive impact from shares issued in the second quarter relating to our stock dividend issued in the second quarter.
These factors were all offset by increased lease termination income of $7 million and land sale gains totaling $11 million net impact.
We do expect approximately a 3% cumulative drop in occupancy from lease rejections, approximately half of which is already embedded within the 90.8% reported occupancy [Inaudible] third quarter, and the balance of these stores will close within the fourth quarter.
Year to date, we have reported $57 million in additional bad debt reserves versus 2019, including $50 million of bad debt expenses and $7 million of lease revenue reversals for tenants accounted for on a cash basis.
We've recorded well over $20 million in nonrecurring short-term rental assistance year to date and we expect those to continue into the fourth quarter of 2020.
Given the continued improvement in rent collections of 80% in the third quarter and over 80% in October, liquidity continues to improve.
Cash on hand has increased from $573 million at June 30 to $630 million at September 30.
We are closing on a 10-year $95 million financing on Tysons Vita, the residential tower at Tysons Corner.
The loan will have a fixed rate of 3.3% and will include interest-only payment during the entire loan term.
This will provide approximately $47 million of liquidity to the company, and we expect the loan closing to occur within the next several weeks.
To date, all of our properties are open, and I'm happy to report that 93% of the square footage that was opened pre-COVID is now open today.
In fact, as we look at our top 200 rent paying retailers, we've either received full rent payment or secured executed documents with 147 and are in LOI with another 23, all of which totals approximately 93% of the total rent these top 200 pay.
Third quarter saw an average collection rate of 80%, that's compared to 61% in the second quarter.
And as of today, as Tom mentioned, our collection rate for October stands at about 81%.
Portfolio-related sales for the third quarter were $718 per square foot, and that's computed to exclude the period of COVID closures for each tenant.
The $718 is down from $800 per square foot at the end of the third-quarter 2019.
For centers opened the entire month, sales in September were actually 92% of what they were a year ago, once we exclude Apple and Tesla.
Occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 90.8%.
That's down 50 basis points from last quarter and down 3% from a year ago.
Temporary occupancy was 5.7%, that's down 70 basis points from this time last year.
Trailing 12-month leasing spreads were 4.9%, that's down from 5.1% last quarter and down from 8.3% in Q3 2019.
Average rent for the portfolio was $62.29, down from $62.48 last quarter, but up 1.8% from $61.16 one year ago.
In the third quarter, we signed 120 leases to 342,000 square feet.
Some leases signed in the third quarter of note include Gucci, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Ducati Paris at Scottsdale Fashion Square; Kids Empire and State 48 Brewery at SanTan; Barbarie's Grill at Danbury Fair; Starbucks at Fashion District Philadelphia; Madison Reed at 29th Street; Polestar at The Village at Corte Madera; finally, Lucid Motors at Scottsdale Fashion Square and Tysons Corner.
At this point in time, by virtue of COVID workouts and through the normal course of leasing, we have commitments on 26% of our 2021 expiring square footage with another 67% in the LOI stage.
This brings our total leasing activity on 2021 expiring square footage to just over 90%.
We opened 44 new tenants and 276,000 square feet, resulting in total annual rent of $11.3 million.
This represents 65% of the openings we had at the same quarter last year, but with 15% more square footage and virtually the same total annual rent.
And also in October, we remained active with Dick's Sporting Goods, opening them at Vintage Faire in a portion of Sears, and at Danbury Fair in the former Forever 21 box.
At this point, we have signed leases with 190 retailers scheduled to open throughout the remainder of 2020 and into 2021.
This totals 1.7 million square feet for a total annual rent of $63 million.
Total impact of this is only 60,000 square feet of the 1.7 million square feet and only $3 million of the $63 million in total rent.
1 store in its region since reopening; or like Bath & Body Works at Freehold, beating last year's sales three months in a row with capacity limited to 50%; or HomeGoods at Atlas Park, outperforming last year by 15% while also at 50% capacity; or Burlington, reopening at Kings Plaza and selling through inventory that took a month to replace; or Sephora at Broadway Plaza, is currently ranked as one of the top stores in the company by virtue of conversion rates that are 20% to 30% higher than last year; or Round One at Deptford and Valley River, operating at full capacity with hour-long waits at night and on weekend; luxury retailers at Scottsdale Fashion Square such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Golden Goose, all exceeding planned by 25% to 40%; or North Italia, a restaurant at La Encantada, back to pre-COVID sales even at 50% occupancy; and Tillys at Arrowhead, reported double-digit sales increases since reopening in May and is expecting their best holiday season ever at this location.
