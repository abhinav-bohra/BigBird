I'm very pleased with our strong third quarter results, which saw EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA increased over 165% compared to Q3 of 2020 and the record results we have posted for the first nine months of the year.
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $741 million thus far in 2021, compared to $261 million for the first nine months of 2020.
We had a very active quarter, completing $1.8 billion of investment transactions, bringing our year-to-date total to $4.4 billion.
Our assets under management has grown by 17% in 2021 to a record $20.5 billion, from $17.6 billion at the end of 2020.
Global transaction volumes remain healthy, with Q3 volumes in the U.S. increasing 150% from last year's levels, according to Real Capital Analytics.
Our Mountain West apartment portfolio, which is our largest region, with almost 11,000 units, outperformed once again, driven by very attractive migration trends and relative affordability.
We also saw significant improvements in our Pacific Northwest and California portfolio, as pandemic-related moratoriums began to burn off, and we expect meaningful rent growth in all of these areas over the next 15 months.
Strong leasing demand in our Dublin multifamily portfolio resulted in occupancy growing by over 400 basis points in Q3 to 96.6 occupancy.
The key acquisitions in the quarter were three wholly owned with multifamily assets totaling 879 units that we acquired for a total of $399 million.
Our multifamily portfolio globally grew to a record 33,400 units at quarter end, including almost 5,000 units under development, which we expect to complete at yields well above current market cap rates.
We're on track to increase our global unit count to 35,000 by year-end.
Our Q3 transactions grew estimated annual NOI to $413 million, an increase of $19 million in the year, and we increased our fee-bearing capital to $4.8 billion, representing a 23% growth year to date.
I'm also pleased to announce that yesterday, our board of directors authorized a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend, which now annualizes to $0.96 per share.
In Q3, we had GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $0.18 in Q3 of last year.
Adjusted net income in the quarter grew to $112 million, compared to $27 million last year.
And adjusted EBITDA grew to $203 million in the quarter, compared to $76 million in 2020.
For the year, we've had GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 per share, adjusted net income of $424 million, and as Bill mentioned, adjusted EBITDA of $741 million, representing record results for the first nine months of the year.
This strong performance led to $79 million in gains and $46 million of accrued performance fees in the quarter.
For the quarter, including promotes, total adjusted fees were $56 million, up from $8 million in Q3 of last year.
Turning to our balance sheet, in August, we issued $600 million of unsecured bonds maturing in 2030.
The proceeds were used to fully pay off our line of credit, as well as the remaining $296 million of our KWE bonds due in 2022, which was completed in October.
We have significantly improved our maturity schedule, with no unsecured debt maturities until 2025 and nothing outstanding on our $500 million revolving credit facility.
Our debt has a pro forma average interest rate of 3.6% and a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years, which has improved by 2.5 years since the beginning of the year.
During the quarter, we bought back $25 million of stock at an average price of $21.55.
Since the beginning of 2018, we've now returned $750 million, or approximately $5.40 per share, to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases, which includes repurchasing 15.7, million shares or approximately 10%, of our outstanding share count.
We still have $213 million on our $500 million buyback authorization remaining, a portion of which was utilized in October.
Positive migration trends and affordability continue to create outsized demand, in particular for our Mountain West portfolio, which saw same-property revenues grow by 11% and NOI grew by 15%.
We think there remains strong upside in our Mountain West portfolio, where average rents are $1,366 per month, and as people continue to seek a higher quality of life and migrate out of higher rent, higher tax states.
Rent concessions in the U.S. were down 63% in Q3 compared to Q3 of 2020, and we saw leasing spreads average a record 27% on new leases across our U.S. portfolio.
The combination of these factors resulted in robust same-store revenue growth across our U.S. market rate multifamily portfolio of 8% and NOI growth of 12% versus Q3 of 2020.
Sequentially, from Q2 of this year, revenues grew by an impressive 6% and NOI by 8%.
In-place rents in our U.S. portfolio are now 6% above pre-pandemic levels.
And with an average loss to lease of 15%, we believe our portfolio is set up for strong growth in 2022 and beyond.
And currently, Capital Dock is 77% leased and on track to be stabilized in Q4.
A great recent example is at one of our largest office assets, 111 Buckingham Palace Road in London, where by October, we transacted on approximately 100,000 square feet of lease transactions, including 20,000 square feet under offer, which in total represents 45% of the building.
These transactions will improve the occupancy significantly, from 80% to 100% in Q4, deliver 26% growth above in-place rents and 40% of the income at pre-COVID top rents in excess of GBP70 per square foot, compared to 15% in Q3 of 2020.
Major tech firms represented 80% of the new leases, illustrating that top tenants are active in the market and willing to make decisions for the right space.
71% of our office NOI is from our European portfolio, which saw Q3 same-property revenue grow by 4% and NOI grow by 5%.
We continue to see this play out in our own portfolio, with approximately 90% of the NOI from low and midrise properties.
We completed 585,000 square feet of leasing in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.5 million square feet, with a WALT of 7.6 years.
Our leasing pipeline remains strong, with 152,000 square feet of leasing completed thus far in Q4 and another 600,000 square feet in legals that we're actively working on closing out, giving us good momentum heading into next year.
Turning to our investment management platform, we continued to see strong growth in the quarter, with our fee-bearing capital growing to $4.8 billion.
This has now increased over 160% since the beginning of 2018.
In July, we announced a new GBP500 million commitment focused on European loans, bringing total global commitments to $3 billion.
In Q3, we completed $440 million of loan investments, including our first loans in Europe on a few large industrial portfolios.
Our debt platform grew by 24% to $1.4 billion in loans outstanding, with $140 million in future unfunded commitments.
We've been able to attract institutional-quality borrowers with high-quality assets to our debt platform, with an average loan size of $70 million and weighted average maturity of four years.
Occupational demand has driven vacancy to an all-time low in the U.K. of 3.4%, and yields continued to compress across Europe, due to accelerating rent growth.
COVID has accelerated the thesis, as online sales penetration continues to grow, with online sales making up 28% of total retail sales in the U.K.
Our industrial portfolio has grown rapidly, and including assets under offer, our portfolio has a gross value of approximately $1.1 billion today across 59 assets, with KW's share at approximately 20%.
We look forward to further growing both our debt platform and our logistics platform in the fourth quarter and continued expansion of our investment management business, which has, in total, $2.1 billion in future commitments from our various strategic partners.
Our developments, totaling $2.7 billion at cost, are being delivered with strong sustainability credentials, with environmental improvements and tenant wellness at the center of our focus.
Once these assets are completed and stabilized, we expect an incremental $105 million of estimated annual NOI to KW, which represents an initial yield on cost of approximately 6%.
We are nearing completion of two office properties in the heart of Dublin, Hannover Quay and Kildaire Street, which total 134,000 square feet that are expected to complete in Q4 and Q1, respectively.
We are going to develop 589 residential units as part of a master-planned community in Camarillo, California.
The project will have 310 wholly owned market-rate units, 170 affordable units built through our vintage housing joint venture, and 109 for-sale townhomes sold by Comstock Homes.
As I mentioned on the last call, we have a clear path to grow our stabilized NOI at the rate of 10% to 15% a year over the next three years, driven by strong organic NOI growth, new acquisitions, and the completion of our construction.
We also plan to grow our fee-bearing capital and resulting fees by 15% to 20% per year over the next three years.
Second, over the last 18 months, we either grew or establish new investment platforms with well capitalized, extremely liquid, global strategic partners who have a keen desire to expand their relationship with Kennedy-Wilson.
