Revenues of $12.6 billion in the quarter increased 21.6% compared to the prior year, largely reflects the National General acquisition and higher net investment income.
Property-Liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 12.9% and 12.1%, respectively.
Net investment income of $974 million increased by over $0.75 billion compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting $649 million of income from the performance-based portfolio.

The addition of National General also added 481,000 new auto applications in the quarter.
The recorded combined ratio of 95.7% increased 5.9 points compared to the prior year quarter.
The total Property-Liability expense ratio of 24.7% in the second quarter decreased by 7.1 points compared to the prior year, again, driven by lower coronavirus-related expenses.

Allstate Protection auto underlying combined ratio finished at 91.8%.
As you can see from the chart, the level remains favorable to 2017 through 2019 historical second quarter and year-end levels despite increasing by 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter.
