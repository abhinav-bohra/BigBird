The fourth quarter demand was exceptional in logistics sector with 104 million square feet of absorption, which was the highest on record.
Demand exceeded supply for the quarter by about 30 million square feet which nudged national vacancy rates down to 4.6%, which is still roughly about 200 basis points below long-term historical averages.
For the full year, demand was 225 million square feet, compared to a sly number of 265 million square feet.
Even when adjusting for the significant amount of activity we saw from Amazon this year, the full year 2020 net absorption was still 12% higher than 2019.
For transactions larger than 100,000 square feet, e-commerce users comprised 22% of total demand and 3PLs about 26%.
Comparatively, e-commerce demand in our own portfolio represented about 20% of our total leasing square footage volume for the year.
This segment of the demand market, users over 100,000 square feet, continues to be the most active subset.
To that end, we signed 29 deals in the fourth quarter over 100,000 square feet in our portfolio.
Asking rental rates rose again in the fourth quarter, up 8.3% over this time last year.
This rate of growth is about 100 basis points higher than the five-year historical average of 7.1%.
In our own portfolio, we had our strongest quarter of the year with 9.7 million square feet of leases executed, which is our second highest quarter ever in our Company's nearly 50-year history.

In addition, the average lease term signed during the quarter was 7.5 years.

The lease activity for the quarter combined with the strong fundamentals I touched on led to another great quarter of rent growth of 13% cash and 27% GAAP.
The first was a 622,000 square foot lease in Northern New Jersey to a leading national home furnishings retailer looking to expand its supply chain network for inventory redundancy, often referred to as safety stock or referred to as increased inventory levels, for them to take 100% of the facility -- 100% of the space in that facility.
The second notable lease transaction in the spec project was 290,000 square feet lease we signed in the South Bay submarket of Southern California.
This lease was a major -- was to a major national beverage distributor to take 100% of the space as well.
Turning to development, we had a tremendous quarter starts, breaking ground on eight projects totaling $420 million in cost and 69% pre-leased.
In total, nearly 70% of our fourth quarter development starts were in coastal Tier 1 markets and five of our eight projects were redevelopments of existing land and site structures.
Our development pipeline at year-end totaled $1.1 billion with 80% of this allocated to coastal Tier 1 markets.
The pipeline is 67% pre-leased and we expect to generate margins in the 30% to 40% range.
Looking forward, our prospect list for new starts in 2021 is very strong, and our land balance at year-end totaled $297 million, with nearly 80% of this allocated to coastal Tier 1 markets, setting us up very well for future growth.
Consistent with our strategy to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets, we sold $276 million of assets in the fourth quarter, comprised of two facilities in the far Northwest submarket Indianapolis, one in the far Northeast market of Atlanta, one facility in the Western portion of the Lehigh Valley and an asset leased to Amazon in Houston.
In turn, we used these proceeds to acquire two assets in Southern California and a portfolio in Seattle for $305 million, that in aggregate are 74% leased, with an expected initial stabilized yield in the mid-4s and long-term IRRs -- unlevered IRRs in the mid-6s.
The Seattle portfolio encompasses three buildings that are 69% leased in aggregate located in the DuPont submarket and adjacent to an existing facility we developed several years ago.
For the full year, our capital recycling encompassed $322 million of asset sales and $423 million of acquisitions.
Combined with the development previously mentioned by Steve, this activity moves our coastal Tier 1 exposure to 41% of GAV and our overall Tier 1 exposure to 67%.
I am pleased to report the core FFO for the quarter was $0.41 per share compared to core FFO of $0.40 per share in the third quarter and represented a 7.9% increase over the $0.38 per share reported for the fourth quarter of 2019.
Core FFO was $1.52 per share for the full year 2020 compared to $1.44 per share for 2019, which represents a 5.6% annual growth rate.
FFO as defined by NAREIT was $1.40 per share for the full year 2020 which is lower than the core FFO due mainly to debt extinguishment charges.
We grew AFFO by 6.2% on a share adjusted basis compared to 2019.
Same property NOI growth on a cash basis for the three months and 12 months ended December 31, 2020 was 3.3% and 5% respectively.
Net operating income from non-same-store properties was 17.3% of total net operating income for the quarter.
Same property NOI growth on a GAAP basis was 3.1% for the fourth quarter and 2.8% for the full year 2020.
We finished 2020 with $295 million outstanding on our unsecured line of credit, which we refinanced earlier this month with a $450 million, 1.75% 10-year green bond issuance which will bear interest at an effective rate of 1.83%.
With this as a backdrop, yesterday, we announced the range for 2021 core FFO per share of $1.62 to $1.68 per share with a midpoint of $1.65, representing an 8.6% increase over 2020.
We also announced growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 5.8% and 10.1% with the midpoint at 8%.
Our average in-service portfolio occupancy range is expected to be 95.7% to 97.7%.
Same property NOI growth on a cash basis is projected in a range of 3.6% to 4.4%%.
We expect proceeds from building dispositions in the range of $500 million to $700 million, which we will use to fund our highly accretive development pipeline.
Acquisitions are projected in the range of $200 million to $400 million with a continued focus on infill coastal markets and facilities with the repositioning or lease-up potential.
Development starts are projected in the range of $700 million to $900 million with a continuing target to maintain the pipeline at a healthy level of pre-leasing.
Our pipeline of build-to-suit prospects continues to remain robust and the $800 million midpoint of our 2021 guidance is consistent with our actual development starts for 2020.
This is evidence that our 2021 guidance of $700 million to $900 million of expected new development starts, strong occupancy expected to remain elevated and most of all evident with our expected growth in FFO per share and AFFO of 8.6% and 8% in the midpoints respectively.
