Continued strong demand across our Material Handling and Distribution segments drove a 58% year-over-year growth in sales, and we delivered a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 20% on an organic basis, with all end markets supplying solid growth.
This is one of the key objectives of the self-help component of Horizon 1.
Net sales were up $69 million, an increase of 58%.
Excluding the impact of the Elkhart acquisition, organic net sales increased 26% due primarily to higher volume mix.
Favorable price contributed 5% and FX 1%.
Adjusted gross profit was up $12.5 million, while gross margin decreased from 36% in the prior year to 29.4% in the quarter.
Adjusted operating income increased $2.80 million to $15.1 million.
Adjusted EBITDA was $20.5 million, an increase of $2.4 million compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9%.
And lastly, adjusted earnings per share was $0.29, an increase of $0.06 or 26% compared to the prior year.
Beginning with material handling, net sales increased $56 million or 70%, including the Elkhart acquisition.
On an organic basis, material handling net sales increased 24% due to strong volume mix.
We gained an additional 6% due to favorable price and 2% in FX.
Material handling adjusted operating income increased approximately 8% to $17 million, driven by higher volume mix and the addition of Elkhart, which were partially offset by an unfavorable price to cost relationship due to escalating raw material costs and higher SG&A expenses.
In the Distribution segment, sales increased $12.6 million or 34%, driven by both equipment and consumable sales.
Distribution's adjusted operating income more than doubled from the prior year to $4.2 million.
Free cash flow was $11.7 million in the quarter, an increase of $8.1 million over the prior year, driven by higher cash from comps.
On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $13.1 million.
Cash on hand at quarter end was $13.5 million.
Reported net sales are anticipated to increase in the mid-40% range.
Our previous sales guidance was in the high 30% range.
Elkhart's annual net sales at the time of acquisition were approximately $100 million.
And Trilogy's annual net sales are roughly $35 million.
We are reaffirming our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $0.90 to $1.05 per share.
Our guidance reflects a weighted average share count of 36.5 million shares.
Other key modeling assumptions include depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $23 million and capex of approximately $15 million to $18 million.
Interest expense is forecasted to be between four and $4.5 million, and the effective tax rate is forecasted to be 26%.
We are targeting approximately $1 million of annual cost synergies, which we expect to realize by the end of 2022.
This is on top of the $4 million to $6 million of cost synergies we expect from Elkhart.
