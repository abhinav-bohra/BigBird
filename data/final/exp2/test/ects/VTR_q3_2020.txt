During the quarter, these asset classes have continued to perform well and led our third quarter performance, enabling us to deliver $0.75 of normalized FFO per share.
Two recent examples of the benefit of our diversified strategy include our investment in a $1 billion Class A Trophy Life Science Portfolio located in the Premier South San Francisco Life Science Cluster at a forward cap rate of 5% on cash NOI.
Spurred by record capital flows into the life science sector, this market has less than 2% lab vacancy, unparalleled access to a large concentration of life science firms and an extensive venture capital network going after the world class talent pool.
We also recently recommenced construction on a 400,000 square foot state-of-the-art Life Sciences project known as One UCity in this thriving research sub market of Philadelphia, bookended by 10 and Drexel.
This project is designed to be LEED certified and total estimated project costs are over $280 million.
Similarly, we've invested on a geographically diversified basis with over 30% of our shop portfolio now in Canada.
We are also investing nearly $420 million in ground up development of new consumer focused senior living communities, which are well under way.
We already have over $3 billion in assets under management in our institutional third-party capital management platform.
These forms include our successful open-end funds, launched in March of this year, that has already grown to nearly $2 billion and 2 million square feet in assets under management.
Following the South San Francisco Life Sciences portfolio closing, when we raised over 600 million of discretionary new equity, our fund exceeds $1 billion in equity capital, and continues to have additional committed capital to accommodate new investments.
This joint venture covers four research and innovation development projects currently in progress with approximately 930 million in estimated project costs.
Our joint venture with GIC may be expanded to over $2 billion with other pre-identified future R&I development projects currently in our pipeline if they go forward.
While we are sober and clear eyed about the recent increase in COVID-19 cases nationally, to a record level of nearly 120,000 confirmed cases today, we believe in the strength of the senior living business as we look toward the post-pandemic environment.
Our 395 assets sequential same-store pool comprising over 90% of our shop NOI, posted cash NOI of 109 million which is effectively flat versus the second quarter.

In September leads and move-ins were 85% and 94%, respectively, as compared to the prior year.
Third quarter revenue declined 3.6% which was offset entirely by 4.5%, lower operating expenses sequentially, primarily driven by lower COVID related expenses.
As with last quarter, I'll highlight our Canadian portfolio, which represents 33% of our shop portfolio and demonstrates the benefits of our diversification and a well-orchestrated public health response.
The 72 communities within our sequential Q3 same-store pool, including our LGM investment was 93.2% occupied, which compares to an average of 93.7% for the second quarter, outperform in the U.S. on an absolute and relative basis.
Same-store cash NOI on a sequential basis grew in Canada by over 10%.

Currently, 96% of our communities are accepting move-ins.
As a result of the diligent efforts of our operators executing, testing and preventative protocols new resident COVID-19 cases more than 75% better than the peak seen in April, in spite of broader market trends of increased new infection rates among the U.S. general public.
Our office segment which now represents over 30% of Ventas' NOI continues to produce strong results and show its value proposition and financial strength and missed the pandemic.
The Office portfolio continued to provide steady growth delivering 126 million of same-store cash NOI in the third quarter.
This represents a 40 basis points of sequential growth.
You will note that the same-store cash NOI declined 2.2% year-on-year for the third quarter.
However, we lapped a large $4.7 million termination fee in the third quarter of 2019.
The same-store cash NOI grew 1.5% from the prior year normalizing for the paid parking shortfall and increased cleaning costs due to COVID, same-store cash NOI grew by 2.8%.
In terms of rent receipts, office tenants paid an industry leading 99% of contractual rents in the third quarter in line with the second quarter.
As of November 6, our tenants have paid more than 99% of October contractual rents.
Receiving 99% of total rent without D docs is a direct reflection of the quality of our tenants and the quality of our buildings.
Remember 88% of MOB NOI is from investment grade tenants or HCA and 97% of our MOB NOI comes from tenants affiliated with major health systems, including some of the nation's most prestigious, not-fort-profit health systems.
As an example, we estimate that our top 10 Health System tenants have collectively received nearly 5 billion in CARES Act relief and 10 billion in Medicare advanced payments.
For our R&I portfolio 76% of our revenues are received from investment grade organizations and publicly listed companies a very solid foundation.
Third quarter 2020 office occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 91.1%, a sequential decline of 40 basis points due to several small tenants not reopening post COVID.
Lab space continues to be in high demand and the R&I portfolio is now 97% leased an outstanding result.
Medical office had a record level retention at 90% for the third quarter of 2020 and for the trailing 12 months.
Driven by this retention total office leasing was 1.2 million square feet for the quarter and 2.7 million square feet year to-date.
This is 400,000 square feet higher than our third quarter of 2019 leasing and 300,000 square feet higher than the third quarter 2019 year-to-date leasing.
As an example, paid parking is more than doubled from the depths of COVID but as recovered to 65% to 70% of pre-COVID levels, climbing but still below historical levels.
This gives us confidence that our occupancy will soon build from the current state which is already 96% leased.

These tenants are now on a cash basis and represent approximately 50 million of annual cash rent, notwithstanding the write-offs, all these tenants are current, and we will endeavor to collect all our contractual rents going forward.
