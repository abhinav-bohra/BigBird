Since the second quarter of 2020, the earnings power of our business has increased considerably driven by the strong and improving performance from the large majority of our affiliates, combined with the impact of strategic investments and actions we have taken to reposition our business over the past 18 months.
These collective actions contributed to year-over-year growth in EBITDA of 27% in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in management fees and performance fees, as well as operational efficiency.
With our enhanced capital position and substantial free cash flow, we deployed more than $800 million across the combination of growth investments and share repurchases, including new partnerships with Comvest, Jackson Square and Boston Common while simultaneously repurchasing 10% of our shares over the course of the year.
In its most fundamental way, sustainability, from the perspective of long-termism and the preservation of a firm's ability to build and create value over time, has been at the very heart of AMG's business purpose since our inception in 1993.
In helping our affiliates to manage long-term risk and enhance their ability to grow over time, AMG has focused on sustainability of independent partner-owned firms for nearly 30 years.
Adjusted EBITDA of $255 million grew 27% year over year, driven by strength in both management and performance fees, and economic earnings per share of $4.22 benefited from an enhanced level of share repurchase activity.
AMG delivered strong earnings growth despite net client cash outflows of $15.8 billion that were driven by certain quantitative strategies and seasonal client redemptions.
Quantitative strategies accounted for 95% of outflows in the quarter while contributing approximately 3% of run rate EBITDA.
In alternatives, we reported net inflows of $700 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing momentum across our illiquid alternative affiliates.
Strength in private markets was partially offset by $2 billion in seasonal redemptions in certain liquid alternative strategies with fourth-quarter liquidity windows.
Overall, our private markets book remains a significant source of earnings growth, accounting for nearly 20% of management fee EBITDA and continues to build future carried interest potential.
We reported net outflows of $2.3 billion in global equities and $1.1 billion in U.S. equities, partly due to the impact of retail seasonality.
Our investment performance across our fundamental equity strategies continues to be very strong with approximately 80% of fundamental equity AUM above benchmark for the five-year period, significantly outpacing the 62% level of two years ago.
Multi-asset and fixed income strategies posted another strong quarter of organic growth, generating $1.9 billion of net inflows driven by muni bond strategies and broader wealth solutions at GW&K and Baker Street.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $255 million grew 27% year over year, driven by strong investment performance, higher markets, lower corporate expenses and the impact of growth investments in both existing and new affiliates, including affiliate equity purchases.
Adjusted EBITDA included $60 million of performance fees, driven by strong investment performance across a broad array of alpha-oriented strategies.
Economic earnings per share of $4.22 and further benefited from an elevated level of share repurchase activity, which I'll expand on in a moment.
For the full year, performance fees of $86 million represented approximately 11% of our earnings.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 240 to 250 million based on current AUM levels, reflecting our market blend, which was up 2.5% as of Friday.
Our estimate includes a performance fee range of 35 to 45 million, reflecting normal seasonality and strong performance at our liquid alternative managers.
Our share of interest expense was 27 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of our hybrid debt offering.
Controlling interest depreciation was 2 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect a consistent level for the first quarter.
Our share of reported amortization and impairments was 87 million for the fourth quarter.
In the first quarter, we expect this line item to be approximately 40 million.
Our effective GAAP and cash tax rates were 24 and 25% for the fourth quarter.
For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP and cash tax rates to be approximately 25 and 19%, respectively, for the first quarter.
Intangible-related deferred taxes were negative 3 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect intangible related deferred taxes to be 9 million in the first quarter.
Other economic items were negative 8 million and included the mark to market impact on GP and seed capital investments.
In the first quarter, for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items, excluding any mark-to-market impact on GP and seed to be 1 million.
Our adjusted weighted average share count for the fourth quarter was 45.3 million, and we expect share count to be approximately 43 million for the first quarter.
We doubled the duration of our debt to 15 years while keeping our cost of debt unchanged, enhanced our capital flexibility by issuing junior hybrid debt and significantly improved our liquidity position, including the repurposing of our dividend in favor of share repurchases.
We invested approximately 400 million of capital into growth investments across four new affiliate partnerships, an elevated level of Affiliate equity purchases and seed and GP capital commitments.
In addition, we repurchased 430 million of shares during the year, repurchasing 10% of our shares outstanding.
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 226 million of shares versus our guidance of at least 100 million.
The additional 126 million of repurchases in the quarter reflects strong business performance in the second half of 2020 and significant incremental cash generated from performance fees and tax benefits.
In the first quarter, we expect to repurchase approximately 200 million of shares, which is elevated by 100 million as a function of our strong year-end cash position and first-quarter performance fee expectations.
We expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $15.50 to $17, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA range of 875 million to $940 million.
The midpoint of that range includes a market performance through last Friday and 2% quarterly market growth starting in the second quarter, performance fee contribution of approximately 10% of earnings and a weighted average share count for the year of approximately 41.5 million, which reflects $500 million of excess capital returned through share repurchases.
