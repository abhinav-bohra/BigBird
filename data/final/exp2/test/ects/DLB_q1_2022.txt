While revenue and earnings per share finished within our range of guidance, both were impacted by a $6 million negative true-up for lower-than-estimated unit shipments in our foundational audio technologies.
At the same time, we see strength across Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and our imaging patents portfolio, and we remain confident in our ability to grow these revenues at a rate of over 35% this year.
During LG's CES keynote, they highlighted their latest OLED TVs, the first to support Dolby Vision gaming at 4K -- in 4K at 120 hertz.
Two-thirds of the Top 100 billboard artists now have one or more tracks available in Dolby Atmos.
There are currently about 98% of Dolby Cinemas opened globally with six new sites launched during our fiscal Q1.
Let's talk about our developer platform, Dolby.io, where we are focused on enabling developers to create the most compelling experiences in target markets where we can offer the most differentiation, virtual live performances, online and hybrid events, social audio, premium education, gaming, and content production, which we estimate to represent a market opportunity of about $5 billion and growing.
With Millicast, developers can take the highly interactive experiences they build with Dolby.io and stream them to audiences of more than 60,000 people with ultra-low delay, a capability that is in demand in our focused verticals.
Total revenue in the first quarter of $352 million was in the range we provided and included a negative true-up of about $6 million for Q4 2021 shipments reported that were below the original estimate.
On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was about $38 million below last year's Q1 as we benefited from a $21 million true-up in Q1 2021, which is a $6 million negative true-up in Q1 2022, and the prior year also benefited from timing of revenues under contract.
Q1 revenue was comprised of $332.3 million in licensing and $19.3 million in products and services.
Broadcast represented 37% of total licensing in fiscal Q1.
Broadcast revenues declined by about $18 million or 13% from the prior-year Q1 due to timing of revenue and a larger true-up in the prior year and lower recoveries.
Mobile represented 23% of total licensing in fiscal Q1.
Mobile decreased by $31 million or 29% compared to Q1 of last year as our foundational audio revenues last year benefited from both high recoveries and timing of revenues under contract, partially offset by new imaging patent licenses.
Consumer electronics represented about 17% of total licensing in fiscal Q1.
On a year-over-year basis, Q1 CE licensing increased by approximately $6 million or 11%, driven by higher foundational audio revenues for DMAs and soundbars, as well as higher recoveries.
PC represented about 10% of total licensing in fiscal Q1.
Our Q1 PC revenues increased by 6% or $2 million compared to the prior-year Q1.
Other markets represented about 13% of total licensing in fiscal Q1.
Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue in Q1 was $19 million, compared to $70 million in last year's Q1.

During the first quarter, we bought back about 400,000 shares of our common stock at the end of the quarter with $256 million of stock repurchase authorization available.
In February, our board authorized an additional $250 million of stock buyback, bringing our total authorization to approximately $506 million to enable expansion of our share buyback program.
We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.25 per share.
For Q2, we see total revenues ranging from $315 million to $345 million.
Within that, licensing revenues could range from $300 million to $325 million.
Q2 products and services revenue could range from $15 million to $20 million.
Q2 gross margin on a GAAP basis is expected to be 89%, plus or minus, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be about 90%, plus or minus.
Operating expenses in Q2 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $224 million to $236 million.
Included in this range is approximately $5 million to $7 million of restructuring charges, primarily for severance and related benefits as we adjusted resources toward the areas where we see the largest opportunities.
Operating expenses in Q2 on a non-GAAP basis are estimated to range from $190 million to $200 million, which contemplates the impact of our annual merit increase.
Other income is projected to be around $1 million for the second quarter.
And our effective tax rate for Q2 is projected to range from 19% to 20% on a GAAP basis and 18% to 19% on a non-GAAP basis.
Based on the combination of factors I just covered, we estimate that Q2 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.42 to $0.57 on a GAAP basis and from $0.72 to $0.87 on a non-GAAP basis.
We are maintaining our fiscal '22 total revenue guidance of $1.34 billion to $1.4 billion.
This was a result in about 5% to 9% of year-over-year growth as compared to the $1.28 billion in fiscal year '21.
Within this, licensing revenues could range from $1.260 billion to $1.315 billion, compared to $1.214 billion in fiscal year '21, which will result in a 4% to 8% year-over-year growth.
Our other markets category is still expected to grow over 25%, primarily from Dolby Cinema and to a lesser extent, from gaming, followed by PC and mobile, which we expect to grow mid- to high single digits.
Products and services revenue are expected to range from $75 million to $90 million for fiscal year '22 with improvements in Cinema products and growth in Dolby.io.
With the restructuring charge expected in Q2, operating expenses in fiscal 2022 can now range from $877 million to $897 million on a GAAP basis.
On a non-GAAP basis, the expected operating expense range remains unchanged at $750 million to $770 million.
As we said last quarter, our business model remains very strong as we expect to deliver operating margins between 24% to 26% on a GAAP basis and between 34% and 36% on a non-GAAP basis.
Based on the factors above, we estimate the full year diluted earnings per share now range from $2.50 to $3 on a GAAP basis.
On a non-GAAP basis, full year diluted earnings per share remains unchanged at $3.52 to $4.02.
