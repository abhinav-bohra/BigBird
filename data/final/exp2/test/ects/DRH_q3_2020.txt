And fourth, we struck a sweeping deal with Marriott that not only increased the NAV of our portfolio by $50 million but distinguishes DiamondRock's portfolio as the least encumbered by long-term management agreements among all full service public lodging REITs.
Although the environment required significant reductions in staffing, we were able to soften the blow to hotel associates with nearly $8 million in severance paid out this year.
Hotel adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a $17.4 million loss, a marked improvement from the $30.4 million loss in the second quarter.
Corporate adjusted EBITDA was a $24.4 million loss as compared to a $37 million loss in the second quarter.
Third quarter adjusted FFO per share was a loss of $0.22 as compared to a loss of $0.20 in the second quarter.
Two items worth noting with these results: one, they exclude $7.4 million in onetime severance costs; and two, this one is important, adjusted FFO per share was negatively impacted by a non-cash income tax valuation allowance recognized in the quarter of $12.4 million or $0.06 per share.
In other words, our third quarter AFFO would have been a loss of only $0.16 per share without that tax adjustment.
Moreover, in the quarter, we successfully reopened five more hotels and had nearly 90% of our rooms available to sell at the end of the third quarter.
To illustrate the progress, that 90% figure compares to just 58% at the end of the second quarter.
Furthermore, portfolio occupancy jumped over 1,000 basis points from the second quarter to 18.6%.
Recall that we ended the second quarter with just 22 hotels open and operating.
Those 23 hotels saw occupancy rise from 26% in July to 28% in August, and finally, to 31% in September.
For the entire portfolio, total revenue decreased 79% in the quarter as a result of an 81% decline in RevPAR, that was partially offset by a smaller decline in food and beverage revenue.
Total revenues were $50 million in the quarter as compared to just $20.4 million in the second quarter.
Over the summer, monthly revenues showed steady progress, rising from slightly over $11 million in June to over $14 million in July, to over $16 million in August, and finally, reaching almost $20 million in September.
Encouragingly, revenue in October looks to be coming in even a little bit better at over $22 million.
For example, the rooms department margin rose from 45% in the second quarter to 64% in the third quarter, driven in large part by a 25% sequential reduction in the cost per occupied room.
In June, we had 10 hotels generating positive gross operating profit, or GOP, and this figure rose to 18 hotels by the end of September.
Over that same period, GOP margin moved from a negative 35% to a positive 9% margin as a testament to our ability to drive revenue while constraining costs.
On an EBITDA basis, six hotels in June were operating profitably, and that figure rose to 10 hotels by September.
What you cannot see, however, is an additional 10 hotels were, on average, approximately $100,000 from breakeven EBITDA in September.
If we exclude the two big box hotels, the Chicago Marriott and the Westin Boston, from the 27 hotels we had open in September, the remaining 25 hotels collectively would have been within $200,000 of breakeven EBITDA.
The Landing in Lake Tahoe saw a 19% increase in RevPAR over the third quarter 2019 with an ADR of nearly $500 per night and total RevPAR approaching nearly $560 per night.
EBITDA margins at this hotel increased nearly 1,400 basis points as compared to the third quarter in 2019.
The L'Auberge de Sedona saw a 21% increase in RevPAR over the third quarter in 2019 with total RevPAR approaching nearly $675 per night.
The restaurant opened strong, and in just the first month of operation, generated nearly $325,000 in revenue.
The resort portfolio performance increased strongly and steadily over the quarter from 36% occupancy and $141 in total RevPAR in July to over 43% occupancy and nearly $191 in total RevPAR in September, a $50 per night jump.
For the third quarter, ADR at our resorts increased 2.2% as compared to last year with September showing good strength and up 5%.
In fact, business transient rooms were 23% of total rooms sold in the third quarter, up from only 19% in the second quarter.
The first data point is that DiamondRock saw approximately 250,000 room nights of leads generated each month during the quarter, with most of the inquiries for 2021 and 2022.
September volume is up 18% versus August, and October is on pace for a strong performance, too.
Cvent also reports that overall group rates are down approximately 5% to 10% in 2021 but up 5% to 10% in 2022.
We held capex spending to $8.6 million in the quarter, which is inclusive of approximately $0.5 million for Frenchman's Reef.
We expect these investments will be measurable earnings contributors in 2021, and the average IRR for these projects is expected to exceed 30%.
We improved our liquidity in the quarter by nearly $71 million as a result of the successful preferred offering -- preferred equity offering.
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $435 million of total liquidity, including corporate-level cash, hotel-level cash and undrawn revolver capacity.
Before capex, our average monthly burn rate in the third quarter, pro forma for the preferred dividend, was $14.7 million.
Let me walk through the sources of the $2 million improvement.
The net operating loss at the corporate NOI level was $10 million per month in the quarter, as compared to our earlier estimate of $11.5 million, a $1.5 million per month improvement, owing, among other reasons, to improving top line, strict cost controls and the decision to reopen additional hotels.
Debt service was $4.1 million per month in the quarter, as compared to a prior estimate of $4.5 million.
The $3,000 to $4,000 per month savings is a result of forbearance that will reverse in the coming months.
The straight line capital expenditure budget in both cases is $3 million per month.
Including capex, our total Company burn rate was $17.7 million during the quarter and implies a cash runway through late 2022.
We updated our analysis of breakeven profitability and estimate that on whole, the portfolio will achieve breakeven profitability at 25% occupancy on a gross operating profit basis and 40% on a net operating income basis.
This is about 500 basis points lower occupancy than our original -- or I should say, our earlier estimates of breakeven occupancy.
The average daily rate assumed in this analysis is approximately 20% to 25% decline from 2019 levels.
We ended the third quarter with $111 million of cash and over $300 million of undrawn capacity on our revolver.
We executed a $119 million, 8.25% Series A preferred offering in August and elected to use $50 million of the proceeds to pay down our revolver, which remain available to us, and retain the remaining net proceeds from the offering in cash.
At the end of the quarter, we had $605 million of non-recourse mortgage debt at a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% and $500 million of bank debt, comprised of $400 million of unsecured term loans and just under $100 million drawn on our unsecured revolving credit facility.
For DiamondRock, bank debt is less than 50% of our net debt and net debt is just 22% of our estimated replacement cost of our hotels.
In addition to the 50 basis point to 100 basis point improvement in residual cap rate for the five hotels that generally [Indecipherable] to franchise properties, we believe the change will produce approximately $2 million of incremental profit on stabilized cash flows.
We've already started reaping benefits from the change, as we consolidated finance and management roles in Alpharetta, Denver, Sonoma and Charleston that will yield almost $400,000 of annual savings.
Consistent with prior expectations, we estimate this repositioning and sale could result in $3 million of incremental EBITDA, given the significant rate differential that exists today between the resort as a Marriott and the luxury competitive set.
In the aggregate, we calculate that the sweeping agreement adds at least $50 million of net asset value to the DiamondRock portfolio.
Our current view is that at least one of the 11 vaccines in Phase III trials could announce positive findings in the next 90 days with broad distribution by mid-2021.
We have great assets, strong industry relationships and an experienced management team that has successfully weathered numerous prior downturns over the prior 30 years.
