With the lingering effects of COVID, particularly in the Middle East, we expect international revenues will increase by roughly 10% in Q3 with a more pronounced improvement in Q4.
Corporate office expense is expected to increase by roughly $1 million from the Q2 level, largely reflecting the timing of long-term performance-based incentive expense along with the full lifting of salary austerity measures put in place during 2020.
