This approach has served us well over the past 15 months as we progressed our strategy in a volatile operating environment.
We delivered sales of $1.98 billion, in line with our expectations as we cycled a 17% organic growth comparison to a year ago.
In our core categories, most of our brands grew at higher rates than pre-pandemic levels and our brand consumption on a two-year comparison grew 9%.
As a result of the third quarter pressures on margin, adjusted earnings per share came in lower than we expected at $0.57.
Our net sales decline of 14% and in-market performance of minus 24% in the third quarter reflect lapping the historically high consumption levels that we experienced during the onset of the pandemic last year.
Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we delivered strong consumption growth of 9% against organic net sales growth of 3% with the gap driven by our foodservice business, which continued to recover as governments gradually eased on-site dining restrictions in some markets.
In-market consumption for soup was strong versus two years ago growing at 9% and gaining dollar share.
We delivered record share growth in U.S. soup of nearly 2 points driven by condensed soups, Swanson broth, Chunky, and Pacific Foods.
In fact, condensed delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of dollar share gains growing share nearly 3 points.
Notably with millennial consumers, condensed grew share by nearly 4 points.
Pacific Foods continued to be a powerful growth engine within our soup portfolio with in-market consumption growth of nearly 30% on a two-year basis and continued share gains versus prior year, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of share improvement.
On Swanson broth, as we invested to restore distribution and service, we increased share by nearly 2 points versus prior year.
Prego delivered its 24th consecutive month with the Number 1 share position in the Italian sauce category and achieved its strongest share gain in over three years.
Let's now turn to Snacks where our power brands continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 14% on a two-year basis despite being down 5% year-over-year.
On a two-year basis, total Snacks consumption grew 10% against organic net sales growth of 3% with the gap driven by the decline in our partner brands and continued pressure in the convenience channels.
On a two-year comparison within the power brands, our salty snack brands grew in-market consumption nearly 20% and increased household penetration across the majority of these brands.
Our Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse products also continued to deliver exceptional results with in-market consumption growth of 9% on top of the prior year increase.
Turning to Goldfish, we returned to share growth, increasing by more than 1 point compared to prior year.
During the quarter, organic net sales declined 12% and adjusted EBIT decreased 27% driven by lower sales volume and a lower adjusted gross margin partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 31% to $0.57 per share primarily reflecting the decrease in adjusted EBIT.
Year-to-date, our organic net sales increased 1% driven by lower promotional spending in both divisions.
Meals & Beverages increased 1% mainly driven by growth in U.S. soup and V8 beverage offset by declines in foodservice.
Year-to-date adjusted EBIT of $1.14 billion was comparable to prior year as a lower adjusted gross margin and increased adjusted administrative expenses were offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, higher adjusted other income and sales volume gains.
Within marketing and selling expenses, lower selling and other marketing costs were partially offset by a 3% increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense or A&C.
Year-to-date, our adjusted EBIT margin was 17.2% compared to 17.3% in the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $2.43 per share primarily reflecting lower adjusted net interest expense.
Our organic net sales decreased 12% during the quarter lapping the prior year organic net sales increase of 17% when the demand for at-home consumption surged at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales grew 3%.
Our adjusted gross margin decreased by 290 basis points in the third quarter from 34.7% to 31.8%.
Now let me tie it back to Mark's earlier comments, which excludes the 250 basis points net benefit from mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding commodity hedges included in inflation and other in the bridge.
These external factors included approximately 290 basis points of inflation and some temporary disruption from the Texas storm back in February, both reflected in inflation and other in the bridge.
Cost inflation was approximately 4% on a rate basis, which was higher than anticipated largely driven by freight rates.
Partially offsetting these headwinds was our ongoing supply chain productivity program, which contributed 150 basis points to gross margin and included initiatives among others within procurement and logistics optimization.
Each had an approximate 110 basis point negative impact on gross margin in the third quarter.
Net pricing drove a positive 30 basis point improvement.
These costs were mainly related to the transformation of our Snacks division and were partially offset by our cost savings program, which added 60 basis points to our gross margin.
Moving on to other operating items, marketing and selling expenses decreased $37 million or 15% in the quarter.
Overall, our marketing and selling expenses represented 10.2% of net sales during the quarter compared to 10.7% last year.
Adjusted administrative expenses decreased $2 million or 1% driven primarily by lower incentive compensation partially offset by higher benefit related costs.
Adjusted administrative expenses represented 7.2% of [Technical Issues] an 80 basis point increase compared to last year.
This quarter, we achieved $20 million in incremental year-over-year savings resulting in year-to-date savings of $55 million.
We expect an additional $20 million in the fourth quarter to deliver an aggregate $75 million of cost savings for the fiscal year with the majority of the savings from the Snyder's-Lance integration.
We remain on track to deliver our cumulative savings target of $850 million by the end of fiscal 2022.
As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined by 27%.
The previously mentioned net sales decline resulted in a $88 million dollar EBIT headwind while the 290 basis point gross margin decline resulted in a $58 million EBIT headwind.
Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by 290 basis points to 14.3%.
Adjusted earnings per share decreased $0.26 from $0.83 in the prior year quarter to $0.57 per share due to the negative $0.26 impact of adjusted EBIT as slightly lower interest expense was offset by slightly higher adjusted taxes.
In Meals & Beverages, organic net sales decreased 15% to $1 billion primarily due to declines across U.S. retail products, including U.S. soup and Prego pasta sauces as well as declines in Canada and foodservice.
Sales of U.S. soup decreased 21% due to volume declines in condensed soup, ready-to-serve soups, and broth lapping a 35% increase in the prior year quarter.
For Meals & Beverages, volume decreased in U.S. retail driven by lapping increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year quarter when organic net sales increased 21%.
Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales in Meals & Beverages grew 3%.
Operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 35% to $179 million.
Overall within our Meals & Beverages division, the operating margin decreased year-over-year by 550 basis points to 17.2%.
Within Snacks, organic net sales decreased 8% driven by volume declines within our salty snacks portfolio including Pop Secret popcorn, Cape Cod potato chips, and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels as well as in Lance sandwich crackers, partner brands and fresh bakery.
Volume declines were partially driven by lapping increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year quarter when organic net sales increased 12%.
Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Snacks organic net sales grew 3%.
Operating earnings for Snacks decreased 29% for the quarter driven by a lower gross margin and sales volume declines partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses and lower administrative expenses.
Overall within our Snacks division, the operating margin decreased year-over-year by 350 basis points to 11.5%.
Fiscal year-to-date cash flow from operations decreased from $1.1 billion in the prior year to $881 million primarily due to changes in working capital, principally from lower accrued liabilities and lapping significant benefits in accounts payable in the prior year.
Our year-to-date cash for investing activities were largely reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $190 million, which was $30 million lower than the prior year primarily driven by discontinued operations.
Our year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $1.4 billion, reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $327 million.
Additionally, we reduced our debt by $1 billion [Phonetic].
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $209 million.
We expect net sales for fiscal 2021 to decline 3.5% to 3%.
Excluding the impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 and the impact of the European chips and Plum divestitures, we expect organic net sales to decline 1.2% to minus 0.7%.
To put our fiscal 2021 organic net sales guidance into perspective at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal 2021 to be 6% above fiscal 2019.
We expect adjusted EBIT of minus 5% to minus 4%.
We expect net interest expense of $210 [Phonetic] million to $215 [Phonetic] million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%.
As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.90 to $2.93 per share, representing a year-over-year decline of minus 2% to minus 1% to the prior year.
The earnings per share impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 was estimated to be $0.04 per share.
To put our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance into perspective at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal 2021 to be in line with fiscal 2020 considering the impact of the 53rd week and 27% above fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS.
Regarding capital expenditures, we now expect to spend approximately $300 million for the full year, which is below previous expectations driven by the impact from COVID-19 on the operating environment.
