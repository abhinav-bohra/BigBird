We achieved a new record in the second quarter for long-term net inflows totaling $31 billion.
This follows net inflows of $24.5 billion last quarter and up nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year.
Looking at our ETFs, excluding the Qs, they generated net long-term inflows of $12 billion during the quarter.
Net long-term inflows from alternatives during the quarter were $4.3 billion, including strength in our private markets business.
We launched two CLOs during the period, raising $1 billion and generated net inflows into our real estate business of a billion dollars.
MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various alternative strategies, materially increasing the speed with which [Phonetic] we can get to market for the benefit of our clients.
We also have $5 billion in direct real estate capital available for deployment.
We had net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion into active fixed income and within the active global equities, our $52 billion [Phonetic] developing markets fund, a key capability that came with the Oppenheimer combination, continued to see net inflows of nearly $1 billion dollars during the quarter.
Second-quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $3 billion from Greater China and our Chinese joint venture continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for us as an organization.
In addition, our solutions enable institutional pipeline accounts for 35% of the pipeline at quarter-end, this following the funding of a large passive mandate from Australia in the second quarter which was enabled by our Solutions team.
But I would note, the growth we are experiencing is driving positive operating leverage producing an adjusted operating margin of 41.5% for the quarter.
Our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or feeding benchmark on a five-year and a 10-year basis.
We ended the quarter with $1.525 trillion in AUM.
Of the $121 billion in AUM growth, approximately $66 billion is a function of increased market values.
Our diversified platform generated gross inflows in the second quarter of $114.4 billion.
This [Technical Issues] 82% improvement from one year ago.
Net long-term inflows in the second quarter were $31.1 billion, representing 10.6% annualized organic growth.
Active AUM net long-term inflows were $2.1 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $29 billion.
The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter, driven by positive ETF flows.
This represents a $24.1 billion improvement in net long-term inflows from one year ago, driven by significant improvement in equities in the Americas.
The institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.6 billion in the quarter, augmented by the funding of the nearly $18 billion Australian passive mandate.
Looking at retail net inflows, our ETF, excluding the QQQ, generated net long-term inflows of $12.1 billion.
Our global ETF platform, again excluding QQQ, again captured flows in excess of its market share of AUM in the second quarter and for the first half of 2021 with net ETF inflows in the United States included a continued high level of interest and our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which generated $2.6 billion in net inflows in the second quarter, following $4 billion of net inflows in the first quarter.
You'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $5 billion in the quarter, driven by net inflows into ETFs, various fixed income strategies, private market CLOs, and the direct real estate net long-term inflows that Marty mentioned.
Asia-Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $28.3 billion.
Net inflows were diversified across the region, nearly $18 billion was from the large passive Australian mandate that funded from our institutional pipeline in May.
The balance reflects $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Japan, $3 billion in inflows from Greater China of which the majority was from our China JV, $1.8 billion from Singapore, and the remainder arising from other areas across the region.
Long-term inflows for EMEA excluding the UK were $1 billion driven by retail flows including net inflows into alternative [Phonetic], particularly our US and European senior loan funds.
ETFs, the net inflows in EMEA were $2.2 billion in the quarter.
And finally, the UK experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion in the second quarter, driven largely by net institutional outflows in multi-asset and investment-grade capabilities.
$2.4 billion of these net long-term outflows relate to our Global Targeted Return capability, which had $10.2 billion globally in AUM at the end of June.
The overall UK net long-term outflows in the second quarter were an improvement of $2.7 billion as compared to the first quarter net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion.
Equity net long-term inflows of $15 billion [Phonetic] reflect a good portion of the Australian mandate and ETF, including our S&P 500 equal weight ETF that I mentioned.
We continued to see broad strength in fixed income in the second quarter with net long-term inflows of $13.6 billion.
You see this largely reflected in the $9.1 billion decrease in the net flows in the balance asset class during the quarter to net outflows of $1.8 billion.
Net long-term flows in alternative improved by $4.5 billion over the first quarter, driven primarily by our private markets business through a combination of inflows from the newly launched CLOs, direct real estate, senior loan and commodity capability.
If you do exclude the global GTR net outflows, alternative net long-term inflows were $7.2 billion, quite significant in the quarter.
Our institutional pipeline was $33.3 billion at June 30, reflecting the funding of the large passive indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our custom solution advisory team.
Excluding the impact of the $18 billion passive mandate in the first quarter, the pipeline has increased in size and remained relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of asset and fee composition.
Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies and our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins in customized mandates.
Turning to slide 11 [Phonetic], you'll note that our net revenues increased $52 million or 4.1% from the first quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the second quarter.
The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees of 34.8 basis points, a decrease was 0.90 of a basis point from the first quarter yield level.
The incremental impact relative to Q1 of higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal in the second quarter, but the full impact on the net revenue yield for the second quarter was 0.70 of a basis point.
Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.9% in the second quarter.
The $14.4 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensations and marketing.
Marketing expenses increased $9.8 million in the second quarter, mainly due to seasonally higher levels relative to the first quarter, which is typically the low point for marketing spend annually.
As a result, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs which we reflect in property, office, and technology expenses, will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis.
In the second quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings.
$2 million of the savings was related to compensation expense and $5 million related to property, office, and technology expense.
The $7.5 million in cost savings or $30 million annualized, combined with the $95 million in annualized savings realized through the first quarter of '21 brings us to $125 million in total or 63% [Phonetic] of our $200 million net savings expectations.
As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder realized by the end of '22.
Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 70% of the savings through compensation expense.
The remaining 30% would be spread across occupancy, tech spend, and G&A.
We expect the total program savings to be 65% in comps -- in compensation and about 35% spread across the other categories.
So the $125 million of the expected $150 million in net savings by the end of this year already in the quarterly run rate, the degree of net savings per quarter, we will continue to moderate going forward.
In the second quarter, we incurred $20 million of restructuring costs.
In total, we recognized nearly $170 million of our estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs that were associated with this program.
We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in a range of $85 million to $105 million through the end of 2022.
Adjusted operating income improved $38 million to $541 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed.
Adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 41.5% when compared to the first quarter.
Most importantly, our degree of positive operating leverage reflected in our non-GAAP results was 1.8 times for the quarter, underscoring our focus on driving scale and profitability across our diversified platform.
I'll also point out that our adjusted operating margin back in the third quarter of 2019, which was our first full quarter following the Oppenheimer acquisition, was 40.9%.
At that time we reported a net revenue yield excluding performance fees of 40.7 basis points.
At the end of the second quarter of 2021, our net revenue yield ex-performance fees was 34.8 basis points, yet our adjusted operating margin was 41.5%.
Non-operating income included $42 million in net gains for the quarter, compared to $26 million in net gains last quarter, primarily from increased unrealized gains on seed money and co-investment portfolios.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.8% as compared to 24% in the first quarter.
We estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24% for the third quarter.
Balance sheet cash position was $1.3 billion at June 30 and approximately $750 million of this cash is held for regulatory requirements.
Our cash position has improved considerably over the past year, increasing by nearly $350 million, largely driven by the improvement in our operating income.
During the quarter, we repaid the remaining $177 million forward share repurchase liability in April.
In terms of future cash requirements, in the second quarter, we recorded an adjustment for the MLP liability associated with the Oppenheimer purchase, reducing this liability from our original estimate of nearly $385 million, down to $300 million.
