There were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter.
This quarter, more than 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN valves, an indication that more patients are benefiting from our life changing technologies than ever before.
We are pleased to report better than expected second quarter sales of $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis from a year ago period.
And importantly, sales grew 11% on a two year compounded annual basis, compared to the strong pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019.
In TAVR, second quarter global sales were $902 million, up 48% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period or 14% on a two year compounded annual basis.
In a recent article in the American Journal of Cardiology reported, it reported on the survival of severe AS patients since the introduction of TAVR in 2008.
The analysis included clinical data on 4,000 patients obtained at the mass general and concluded that in the TAVR era overall survival of patients with severe AS has doubled.
The long-term potential, along with the rebound in procedures reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, up from more than $5 billion today.
In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew sequentially over Q1 and over 50% on a year-over-year basis.
Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our sales grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis and we estimate that total TAVR procedure growth was comparable.
In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption, driven by SAPIEN 3 and broad growth across centers of all sizes.
As previously announced, we received the approval earlier in the second quarter for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk and we continue to anticipate increased treatment rates in Japan when reimbursement is approved in Q3.
Now, turning to several recent TAVR clinical trial highlights, last week at the TVT Conference, data on the Vancouver's TAVR Economic Study were presented which further demonstrated the favorable economic value of our SAPIEN 3 platform, a comparison of 1100 patients was conducted to assess the economic impact of next day discharge.
The SAPIEN 3 platform with a minimalist approach achieved better patient outcomes 30-days post-procedure and enhanced resource utilization, which resulted in meaningful cost improvements.
Also at TVT, results from the PARTNER 3 bicuspid registry showed similar outcomes to other TAVR patients, as well as significant improvement in patient symptoms and quality of life.
In summary, based on the strength that we saw in the second quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow around 20% in 2021 versus our previous expectation of 15% to 20% growth.
We advanced our clinical experience with transcatheter replacement as we continued enrollment with our TRISCEND 2 pivotal trial for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement.
In mitral, an analysis of EuroPCR of over 2,100 commercially treated patients provided further evidence of the efficacy, safety, and ease of use of the PASCAL platform.
Turning to the financial performance in TMTT, global sales of $22 million were driven by the continued adoption of our PASCAL platform, as we activated more centers across Europe.
We now expect 2021 TMTT sales of $80 million to $100 million, up from our previous sales guidance of $80 million.
We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025 and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease.
In Surgical Structural Heart, record second quarter global sales of $237 million was up 42% on an underlying basis versus a year ago period.
We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structure Heart market will grow in the mid-single-digits through 2026.
In Critical Care, second quarter global sales were $215 million, up 27% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period.
Total sales grew 49% year-over-year, as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing treatment in the second quarter.
Our underlying two year compounded growth rate in the second quarter was 11%, another indicator that conditions are improving.
The much stronger than expected sales performance lifted by unexpectedly high procedure volume fell through to the bottom-line resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64.
For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, for TAVR $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million, for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million, and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million.
We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high-end of our previous range of $2.07 to $2.27.
While public health conditions remain uncertain, we are projecting total sales in the third quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.29 billion and $1.37 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.56.
For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.9%, compared to 74.4% in the same period last year when we experienced lower sales and substantial cost responding to COVID.
We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between 76% and 77%.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the second quarter were $374 million or 27.2% of sales, compared to $275 million in the prior year.
We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales, excluding special items to be 28% to 29%.
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 24% to $225 million, or 16.4% of sales.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect research and development expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range.
During the second quarter, we recorded a $103 million net reduction in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities which benefited earnings per share by $0.14.
This gain was excluded from the adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 that I mentioned earlier.
Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 10.3%.
This rate included a larger than expected 590 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation.
We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021 excluding special items to be between 11% and 15% including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock-based compensation accounting.
Foreign exchange rates increased second quarter reported sales growth by 450 basis points or $29 million, compared to the prior year.
At current rates, we now expect an approximate $70 million positive impact or about 1.5% to full year 2021 sales, compared to 2020.
Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our second quarter gross profit margin by 180 basis points compared to the prior year.
Free cash flow for the second quarter was $457 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $526 million, less capital spending of $69 million.
We continue to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and investments as of June 30.
Average shares outstanding during the second quarter were 630 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter for $112 million.
In the first half of the year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average price of $85.
In May, we obtained Board approval to increase our share repurchase authorization and currently have approximately $1.2 billion remaining under the program.
We now expect our average diluted shares outstanding for 2021 to be at the lower end of our 630 to 635 million guidance range.
