$93 million of this improvement is from higher gains on used vehicles sold and a lower depreciation expense related to prior residual value estimate changes.
Rental utilization on the power fleet was a record 83% in the quarter and well above the prior year's 71%.
Results also benefited from ongoing momentum from lease pricing initiatives, partially offset by a 3% smaller average active lease fleet.

Importantly, we now expect to achieve ROE of 18% to 19% this year due to stronger than expected performance in FMS and a declining depreciation impact.
In our FMS business, we estimate investments of between $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion annually, and that is the amount needed to replace leased vehicles as contracts are renewed and to refresh the existing rental fleet.
