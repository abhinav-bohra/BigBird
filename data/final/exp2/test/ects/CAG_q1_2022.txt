We believe that consumer demand, coupled with additional pricing and cost-saving actions, will enable us to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share of about $2.50.
As you can see, on a two-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the first quarter increased 7% and adjusted earnings per share grew by nearly 8%.
Total Conagra weighted dollar share grew 0.8 points on a two-year basis in the quarter with share gains in each of our domestic retail domains: frozen, snacks and staples.
Once again, we delivered quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business, both against our peers and as a percentage of our overall retail sales.
E-commerce sales now represent more than 9% of our total retail sales, more than double what they were just two years ago.
As you can see on Slide 14, we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal 2022, compared to the approximately 9% we anticipated at the time of our fourth-quarter call.
As you can see on Slide 15, our total company retail sales on a two-year CAGR basis were up nearly 7% in the first quarter with strong growth across our frozen, snacks and staples domains.
We're increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 1%, up from approximately flat at the time of our Q4 call.
We are reaffirming our adjusted operating margin guidance to remain at approximately 16%.
We're updating our gross inflation guidance to about 11%, and we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of approximately $2.50.
This includes enduring trends that predate the COVID-19 pandemic and new consumer behaviors adopted over the past 18 months.
We have a very strong $2 billion ready-to-eat snacks business that spans multiple subcategories where we either have the fastest-growing brand, the largest brand or both.
Organic net sales declined by 0.4%, compared to a year ago and increased 7% on a two-year CAGR.
On an organic net-sales basis, the 0.4% decrease during the quarter was driven by a 2% decline in volume from lapping last year's elevated demand.
Second, our 1.6% benefit from price/mix laps a 70-basis-point benefit in the prior-year period that was associated with the true-up of fiscal '20 fourth-quarter trade expense accrual.
Without that item, the current quarter's price mix benefit would have been plus 2.3%.
Together, these factors drove a 1% decline in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago.
Net sales for the entire company have increased 7% on a two-year CAGR basis.
First-quarter inflation was 16.6%, driving our adjusted gross margin decline of 530 basis points compared to a year ago.
We delivered 550 points of benefit from our margin lever actions in the quarter, inflation-justified pricing, supply chain realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses.
Note that the 16.6% inflation shown on the slide represents gross market inflation for Q1 and does not include hedging or sourcing benefits.
As you can see on Slide 26, our Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 was heavily impacted by inflation, as well as by a slightly higher tax rate.
We repurchased approximately $50 million of common stock and paid approximately $132 million in cash dividends.
As a reminder, the board of directors approved a 14% increase to our annual dividend in July.
We paid our first dividend at the increased quarterly rate of $0.3125 per share or $1.25 per share on an annualized basis shortly after the conclusion of Q1.
We now expect gross cost of goods sold inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal '22.
We previously expected gross inflation of approximately 9%.
We remain confident in our original adjusted earnings per share guidance of approximately $2.50 for the year, but the path to achieve that guidance has changed.
We now expect organic net sales growth of approximately 1% compared to our prior expectations of approximately flat growth.
Also, we expect our adjusted operating margin to continue to be approximately 16% but sees some modest compression versus our original forecast.
