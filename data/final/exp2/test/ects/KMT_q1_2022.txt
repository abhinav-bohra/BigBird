Our sales performance was in line with our expectations, increasing 19% organically year-over-year and outpacing our normal quarter-over-quarter seasonal trend.
Transportation increased as well with 14% growth year-over-year and outpaced the normal sequential decline.
Our strong operating leverage resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin improving significantly by 730 basis points to 18.6%, demonstrating the benefits of the investments we have made over the last few years.
Operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased year-over-year to 21% and sequentially was flat on lower sales.
Our target for operating expense remains at 20%.
Adjusted earnings per share improved significantly to $0.44 compared to $0.03 in the prior year quarter.
We also began our recently announced share repurchase program, buying back $13 million of shares in the quarter, reflecting the high level of confidence we have in our growth and margin improvement initiatives and free cash flow generation.
Nevertheless, despite the production slowdowns related to the chip shortages and other uncertainties, we expect Q2 sales to be up 9% to 14% year-over-year and in line with the normal sequential growth pattern of 1% to 2%, which highlights the relative strength of our other end markets outside of transportation.
We continue to deliver innovative solutions for machining components and renewable energy equipment like wind turbines, where we provided a new drilling solution, improving productivity by 200% and extending tool life by 700%.
Sales increased by 21% year-over-year and 19% on an organic basis with foreign currency contributing 2%.
On a sequential basis, sales declined only 6%, which is less than our normal Q4 to Q1 seasonal decline.
Adjusted gross profit margin increased 650 basis points to 33.5%.
Adjusted operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased 210 basis points year-over-year to 21.2%, approaching our target of 20%.
Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were up significantly by 730 and 870 basis points, respectively.
These factors were partially offset by the removal of $15 million of temporary cost control actions taken in the prior year and a slight headwind from higher raw material costs beginning to flow through the P&L.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter of 26.9% was lower year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher pre-tax income.
We reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.43 versus an earnings per share loss of $0.26 in the prior year period.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.44 per share versus $0.03 in the prior year.
The effect of operations this quarter were $0.33, which included approximately $0.04 of simplification/modernization carryover benefits and the negative effect of approximately $0.12 from temporary cost control actions taken last year.
Taxes and currency contributed $0.04 and $0.02, respectively.
Metal Cutting sales in the first quarter increased 19% organically year-over-year compared to a 23% decline in the prior year period.
A foreign currency benefit of 2% was partially offset by fewer business days, which amounted to 1%.
All regions posted year-over-year sales growth with the Americas leading at 22%, followed by EMEA at 21%.
Asia Pacific posted more modest growth at 7%, reflective of the timing of the economic recovery from the pandemic, reduced government subsidies for wind energy year-over-year as well as lower industrial activity, mainly in transportation.
Year-over-year, all end markets also posted gains this quarter with general engineering, leading with strong growth of 23%.
Aerospace grew 19% year-over-year and transportation, 14%.
Energy grew 1% year-over-year.
Adjusted operating margin increased substantially to 10.2%, a 920 basis point increase over the prior year quarter.
Organic sales increased by 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 18% in the prior year period.
A foreign currency benefit of 3% was partially offset by fewer business days of 1%.
Again, all regions were positive year-over-year, with the Americas leading at 28%, EMEA at 8% and Asia Pacific at 7%.
By end market, energy was up 37% year-over-year and general engineering was up 23%.
Earthworks was also up 3%, but down sequentially, reflecting the typical seasonal decline we experienced in Q1 related to the traditional road construction season.
Adjusted operating margin improved by 760 basis points year-over-year to 14.1%.
At quarter end, we had combined cash and revolver availability of $807 million and we're well within our financial covenants.
Primary working capital decreased year-over-year to $608 million and was effectively flat on a sequential basis.
On a percentage of sales basis, primary working capital was 32.1%, a decrease both year-over-year and sequentially.
Net capital expenditures were $17 million, a decrease of approximately $22 million from the prior year.
We continue to expect fiscal year '22 capital expenditures to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million.
Our first quarter free operating cash flow was negative $2 million, an improvement of $27 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the strong sales and operating performance this quarter.
We also paid the dividend of $17 million in the quarter.
And finally, as Chris noted, we repurchased $13 million of shares during the quarter under our recently announced repurchase program.
Starting with the second quarter, we currently expect sales to be up approximately 9% to 14% year-over-year and in the range of $480 million to $500 million.
As Chris mentioned, this implies sequential growth in line with our normal seasonality of around 1% to 2%, reflecting the challenges in the transportation end market and continued uncertainty in the general macro environment, offsetting strength in aerospace, energy and general engineering.
Adjusted operating income is expected to be a minimum of $46 million, implying continued strong operating leverage year-over-year, excluding $10 million of temporary cost actions taken last year.
When coupled with the timing of annual merit increases and incremental D&A, the sequential increase in costs will be approximately $10 million.
Lastly, for Q2, we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to remain in the range of 25% to 28% and free operating cash flow to be positive.
This includes depreciation and amortization increasing $15 million to $20 million year-over-year to a range of $140 million to $145 million, capital expenditures to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million and working capital to trend toward our 30% goal by fiscal year-end.
Together, over the full year, these assumptions translate to free operating cash flow generation at approximately 100% of adjusted net income, in line with our long-term target, further demonstrating our progress transforming the company.
And I remain fully confident we will meet our adjusted EBITDA profitability target of 24% to 26% when sales reached the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.
