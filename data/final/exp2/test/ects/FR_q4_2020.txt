We maintained high occupancy levels, grew cash rents and collected over 99% of build rents, more on that in a moment.
We delivered year-end occupancy of 95.7%, up 70 basis points from the guidance midpoint provided on our third quarter call.
For the full year, we grew cash rental rates 13.5%, which is the second highest in our company's history, just behind the 13.9% growth we achieved in 2019.
The positive fourth quarter leasing statistics nationally are consistent with our own experience as CBRE's preliminary figure for net absorption is 104 million square feet, the highest quarterly result in the last four years and exceeding the 69 million square feet of 4Q completions.
For the full year, net absorption was 224 million square feet, 15% higher than 2019.
Completions were 265 million square feet, an increase of 10% over 2019.
I'm pleased to say we're off to a strong start as we've signed leases for approximately 54% of our 2021 rollovers and a cash rental rate increase of approximately 13%.
This early performance is consistent with the 10% to 14% increase we expect on our new and renewal leasing for the full year 2021.
Our expirations for the balance of 2021 are fairly granular with our largest remaining rollover now a 400,000 square footer where the tenant is expected to vacate in May.
As evidence of the strength of the South Florida market, we're pleased to announce we have signed a long-term lease for 100% of the three-building First Cypress Creek Commerce Center with a single e-commerce tenant.
This project totals 377,000 square feet and the lease commenced right at completion on February 1st.
Our total investment is $37.1 million and our first year stabilized cash yield is 6.6%.
In the Inland Empire at our First Redwood project, we signed and commenced leases for both the 358,000 and the 72,000 square foot facilities in the fourth quarter.
And just this week, we fully leased the remaining 44,000 square foot building.
Given our own experience and the strong market dynamics reflected in CBRE's fourth quarter update report, which shows the Inland Empire vacancy rate at 1.9%.
Also in the fourth quarter in Dallas, we signed two leases at First Park 121 to bring a pair of buildings there to 100% occupancy.
The first was for the remaining 101,000 square feet at the 434,000 square foot Building E and the second was a 25,000 square foot expansion at Building B. Each of these leases is a reflection of the continued strong demand for high-quality logistics space and the effort and talent of our leasing teams across the country.
We've broken ground PV 303 Building C in Phoenix on our wholly owned site.
This 548,000 square foot cross-dock facility is our fourth speculative development in this highly sought after size range since 2017.
Total investment for this new development is approximately $42.6 million with a targeted cash yield of 6.6%.
We are planning to break ground in the coming weeks on First Wilson I, a 303,000 square foot facility in the I-215 corridor of the Inland Empire.
This is a $30.2 million development with a targeted completion at the end of December and a projected cash yield of 6.3%.
Lastly, we will be starting a 500,000 square foot development in Nashville known as First Rockdale IV.
Total investment is approximately $26.8 million with a targeted cash yield of 7.2%.
Summing up our development activity in 2020, we placed in service 10 buildings totaling 2.5 million square feet with an estimated investment of $222 million.
These assets are 79% leased at an estimated cash yield of 7.2% upon full lease up.
This represents an expected overall margin of 58% to 68%, which is about a $1 per share of NAV.
As we discussed on our third quarter call, we successfully leased the 644,000 square foot spec building at PV 303 to a single tenant.
Upon completion in the fourth quarter, we negotiated the acquisition of our partners' interest in the building, reflecting a total purchase price of $42.6 million, which is net of our $5.2 million share of the joint venture's gain on sale and incentive fee.
During the quarter, we sold 15 properties for $97.1 million at an in-place cap rate of approximately 6.4%.
In 2020, excluding the previously reported purchase option related sale in Phoenix, we sold 1.9 million square feet for a total of $153.4 million, essentially at the midpoint of our target sales guidance range for the year.
For 2021, our guidance for sales is $100 million to $150 million.
In the coming weeks, we anticipate selling a 664,000 square foot building in Houston at a sales price of approximately $42 million.
Based upon our strong 2020 performance and 2021 outlook, which Scott will discuss shortly, our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.27 per share for the first quarter of 2021.
This is a $1.08 per share annualized, which equates to an 8% increase from 2020.
This dividend level represents a payout ratio of approximately 69% of our anticipated AFFO for 2021 as defined in our supplemental.
NAREIT funds from operations were $0.44 per fully diluted share compared to $0.45 per share in 4Q 2019.
For the full year, NAREIT FFO per share was $1.84 versus $1.74 in 2019.
Excluding the impact of approximately $0.04 per share related to these items, 2020 FFO per share was $1.80.
We have collected 99% of the 2020 monthly rental billings every month since April.
And effectively it would be 100% if we factored in reserves.
This tenant occupied a 137,000 square foot building in the Chino submarket of the Inland Empire West and vacated on December 31st.
Due to the great work of our Southern California team, we were able to lease 100% of the building on a long-term basis with only one month of downtime at a cash rental rate increase of 28%.
In the fourth quarter, we also wrote off the $1.1 million of cash in straight-line rent receivable related to this tenant.
Summarizing our outstanding leasing volume during the quarter, we commenced approximately 4.4 million square feet of leases.
Of these, 700,000 square feet were new, 1.6 million square feet were renewals and 2.1 million square feet were for developments and acquisitions with lease up.
Tenant retention by square footage was 80.6%.
For the quarter, same-store NOI growth on a cash basis, excluding termination fees, was 1.3% helped by an increase in rental rates on new and renewal leasing and rental rate bumps embedded in our leases, partially offset by lower average occupancy and an increase in free rent.
For the full year 2020, cash same-store NOI growth before lease termination fees was 4.4%.
Cash rental rates for the quarter were up 10.4% overall with renewals up 8.6% and new leasing 12.8%.
On a straight-line basis, overall rental rates were up 25.5% with renewals increasing 25.9% and new leasing up 25.1%.
For the year, cash rental rates were up 13.5%, which as Peter mentioned is the second highest in the company's history.
On a straight-line basis, they were up 29.7%.
At December 31st, our net debt plus preferred stock to adjusted EBITDA is 4.8 times and the weighted average maturity of our unsecured notes, term loans and secured financings was 6.3 years with a weighted average interest rate at 3.7%.
Our guidance range for NAREIT FFO is $1.85 to $1.95 per share with a midpoint of $1.90.
Key assumptions for guidance are as follows; quarter end average in-service occupancy for the year of 95.5% to 96.5%; our cash bad debt expense assumption for 2021 is $2 million, consistent with last year's pre-pandemic assumption.
Same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 3% to 4%.
We expect our G&A expense to approximate $33 million to $34 million.
In total, for the full year 2021, we expect to capitalize about $0.05 per share of interest related to these developments.
Guidance reflects the impact from the $42 million sale in Houston, expected to close in the first quarter that Peter discussed, which could be as much as $0.02 per share of FFO impact in 2021 depending on redeployment of the anticipated proceeds.
The guidance also reflects the expected pay off of $58 million of secured debt in the third quarter with an interest rate of 4.85%.
