And despite other operational issues that impacted the quarter including labor shortages and wage inflation in the US that is not yet been offset by price increases that have been enacted, operating profit margin improved by 50 basis points to 10.8%.
We are affirming our four-year 2021 guidance, which includes revenue in the range between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion, with a bias to the higher end of the range due to the strong third quarter results.
Operating profit of approximately $465 million, which reflects a margin increase of close to 100 basis points versus prior year.
And adjusted EBITDA of approximately $660 million reflecting an EBITDA margin of approximately 16%.
We're also affirming our preliminary 2022 adjusted EBIT target range between $785 and $825 million.
After an expected margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points this year, we expect a similar operating profit margin increase next year with margins continuing to be driven by our Strategy 1.0 lean cost initiatives and further margin leverage driven by sustained fixed cost reductions and revenue growth.
Based on these revenue drivers and an expected higher 2021 year-end revenue run rate, we believe revenue in 2022 will exceed 100% of the adjusted pre-COVID revenue level of approximately $4.55 billion, which includes historical revenue acquired with G4S and PAI.
As a reference point, at 100% of the adjusted pre-COVID revenue level, we would expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be about $755 million.
We're also pleased to announce today our plan to enter into a $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that would represent the repurchase of approximately 5% of the company's outstanding shares at the current share price.
We expect the $150 million ASR will be-- we are announcing today will be substantially completed by early November.
Our board has approved another $250 million authorization to be used from time to time over the next 2 years.
On a reported basis, revenue was up 11% with organic growth of 6%.
Operating profit grew 16%, reflecting a margin increase of 50 basis points to 10.8%, and is demonstrating earnings leverage with our revenue increase.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 15% with a margin of 60 basis points to 15.8%, earnings per share grew 28% from $0.89 per share to $1.14.
In North America, third quarter reported revenue grew 14%, while operating profit grew 4%, which includes the impact of the PAI acquisition we did last April.
The impact of this tight labor market reduced segment revenue by about 1% and reduced segment margins by approximately 300 basis points.
Now to Latin America, where revenue continued its double-digit growth trend with reported revenue up 13% and operating profit of 26%, reflecting a margin increase of 240 basis points to 22.3%.
Operating profit improved more than 300 basis points to 11.8%, a result of strong cost management and the benefits of prior-year restructuring actions coming through for the rest of the world segment, revenue grew 8% on a reported basis, accounting for the contribution of the G4S acquisition.
You can see modest sequential improvement from 93% to 97% from the first to second quarter.
We then saw a slight dip down to 96% in the third quarter, and we expect the 4th quarter recovery to be north of 100%.
Now moving to Latin America, you can see that on a local currency basis, recovery has been significantly stronger than North America with the third quarter at 108% of adjusted 2019 levels.
But even excluding Argentina, local currency recovery was 19% in Q3 and is expected to be over 100% in Q4.
We expect the fourth quarter be about 94% recovered in local currency.
In local currency, we're seeing levels similar to North America in the mid 90% range.
Forex translation has been helpful in the region as well and we expect our fourth quarter to come in around 96% on a US dollar basis.
In total, we expect our consolidated results in the fourth quarter to be about 95% on a reported basis and around 100% on a local currency basis.
On slide 7, please remember that we disclose acquisitions separately for the first 12 months of ownership.
After 12 months, there are mostly integrated and then included in organic results.
Included in acquisitions for this quarter are primarily PAI and about 20% of the former G4S businesses.
2021 third quarter revenue was up over 10% in constant currency, with 6% organic growth versus last year and 5% from acquisitions.
Reported revenue was $1,076,000,000, up $105 million or 11% versus the third quarter last year.
Third quarter reported operating profit was $116 million, up 16% versus last year.
Organic growth was 2%, acquisitions added 7%, and forex another 7%.
Our operating profit margin of 10.8% was up 50 bips versus 2020.
Third quarter interest expense was $27 million, up $1 million versus the same period last year, as higher debt associated with completed acquisitions was partly offset by lower average interest rates.
Tax expense in the quarter was $31 million, $8 million higher than last year, driven by higher income.
Our full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate is estimated at 33% versus 32% last year.
$116 million of third quarter 2021 operating profit less interest expense, taxes, and one million dollars in minority interest in other, generated $57 million of income from continuing operations.
This is a 100%, $1.14 of earnings per share up $0.25 or 28% versus $0.89 in the third quarter last year.
The gain on marketable securities positively impacted earnings per share by about $0.03 this quarter versus minus $0.02 in the quarter last year.
Third quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA which excludes $2 million in gains on marketable securities was $170 million, up $22 million or plus 15% versus prior year.
Our 2021 free cash flow target is $185 million, which reflects our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $660 million.
We expect to use about $60 million of cash for working capital growth and restructuring, and another $35 million in 2020 deferred payroll and other taxes payable.
Cash taxes should be approximately $95 million, up $18 million, versus last year, due primarily to the timing of refunds.
Cash interest is expected to be about $105 million, an increase of $27 million due primarily to the incremental debt associated with the G4S and PAI acquisitions.
Our net cash capex target is around $180 million, an increase of $67 million over last year driven by acquisitions and a return to more normalized investment.
Our free cash flow target, excluding the payment of 2020 deferred taxes would be $220 million, generating an EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio of about 33%, up from the 28% achieved in the same basis last year.
While not included in cash flow from operating activities, in July we opportunistically sold all of our shares and MoneyGram for $33 million.
We purchased those shares in November 2019 for $9 million.
Our preliminary 2022 target is to increase our free cash flow, 50 plus percent, to a range of $350 million to $400 million, which equates to $7 to $8 per share.
The current year-end estimates include a $213 million acquisition of PAI, our adjusted EBITDA guidance, and our free cash flow target.
The shaded blue box on top of the 2021 year-end bar represents the impact of the planned $150 million accelerated share repurchase announced today.
Net debt at the end of 2020 was $1.9 billion.
That was up over $500 million versus year-end 2019 due primarily to the debt incurred to complete the G4S cash acquisition.
On December 31, 2020, our total leverage ratio was 3.3 turns At the end of 2021, given our free cash flow guidance and the completion of the G4S and PAI acquisitions, we're estimating a net debt of $2.175 billion or $2.325 billion, including the planned ASR.
This is expected to generate total leverage of 3.3 turns and 3.5 turns respectively.
Our 2022 EBITDA target range of $785 million to $825 million, combined with the estimated year-end 2022 net debt of $2,035,000,000 to $2,095,000,000 would reduce the total leverage ratio to approximately 2.5 to 2.7 turns.
Our Strategy 2.0 Solutions, which learn more about at our December 15 Investor Day, target not only increased customer service, but also a major reduction in weekly stops that could take many more trucks off the roads.
In United States, 28% of in-person transactions are in cash, and approximately 18% of the population is unbanked or underbanked, doesn't have access to credit, and must rely on cash.
Turning now to Page 12.
The bottom layer outlines our 1.0 strategic initiatives that drive core organic growth and cost reductions.
Our target is to achieve annual mid single-digit organic revenue growth, and this has been proven during our first strategic plan period of time, and improve operating profit margins by approximately 200 basis points over the next two years, over the two-year period that is of 2021 and '22.
The middle layer, Strategy 1.5, represents our acquisition strategy.
Including G4S and PAI which are acquisitions completed early in our current strategic plan, we've invested a total of $2.2 billion in over 17 acquisitions since 2017.
As demonstrated by our recent PAI acquisition, future acquisitions may focus more on supporting the Strategy 2.0 and our digital initiatives.
For 2021, again, we're targeting revenue growth of 12%, operating profit growth of 22%, reflecting a margin increase of almost 100 basis points over last year.
Adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%, reflecting an EBITDA margin of 16%, and EBIT-- earnings per share growth of 21%.
Our 2021 revenue as compared to adjusted pre-COVID levels as Mark pointed out, has improved from 89% in the first quarter of this year to 93% in the third quarter that we just reported.
This trend supports our expectation of continued revenue recovery and strong year-end-- and a strong year end jumping-off point, expected to be least 95% which is a great starting point for next year.
So we need just an approximately additional 5% revenue recovery from the fourth quarter run rate throughout full year '22 to reach 100% of our pre-COVID revenue levels.
All these indicators support our belief that 2022 revenue will exceed adjusted pre-COVID 2019 revenue at level of corresponding to our preliminary EBITDA range of $785 million to $825 million.
