As a reminder, in the prior year quarter, we also took several cost saving actions in response to the uncertainty created by the pandemic, which reduced our costs in Q2 last year by approximately $14 million.
In Q2 this year, the return of many of these costs represented a year-over-year expense headwind of approximately $5 million.
Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $335 million, up $65 million or 24% compared to last year.
Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $38.5 million, up $7.2 million or 23% compared to last year.

That translates to a margin of 15.5% in Q2 this year compared to 16.8% last year.
Net income for the quarter was $29.7 million, up from $21.4 million last year.
That equates to GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $0.48 per share, up 37% from $0.35 per share last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.50 per share, an improvement of 19% compared to $0.42 per share last year.
Order intake for the quarter was again outstanding with orders of $361 million representing an increase of $159 million or 79% compared to Q2 last year.
Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter set a new company record at $437 million.
That represents an increase of $104 million or 31% compared to Q2 last year and an increase of $133 million or 44% from the end of last year.
In terms of our group results, ESG's net sales for the quarter were $281 million, up $67 million or 31% compared to last year.

ESG reported total orders of $300 million in Q2 this year, an improvement of $142 million or 90% compared to last year.

Turning now to the consolidated income statement, where the increase in sales contributed to an $11.3 million improvement in gross profit.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 24.4% compared to 26% last year.
As a percentage of sales, our selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were down a 100 basis points from Q2 last year.
Other items affecting the quarterly results include a $1.3 million reduction in restructuring charges, a $2.3 million decrease in other expense and a $700,000 reduction in interest expense.
Tax expense for the quarter increased by $1.9 million, largely due to the increase in pre-tax income levels, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity.
Including the effects of these higher tax benefits, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.2% compared with 22.2% last year.
At this time, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 23%.

Overall, our aftermarket revenues in Q2 this year were up $26 million or 46% year-over-year growing to represent a higher share of ESG revenues for the quarter at around 30%.
Despite these actions and with demand being significantly higher than we had expected, we experienced unfavorable price cost year-over-year headwind of approximately $3 million during the quarter, mostly within our dump truck and trailer business.
