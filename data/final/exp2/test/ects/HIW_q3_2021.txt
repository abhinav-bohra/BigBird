Given the emergence of the delta variant, utilization across our portfolio did not increase as much in the third quarter as we anticipated, leveling off around 40%.
We signed 672,000 square feet of second gen leases, including 245,000 square feet of new deals.
In total, we signed 96 leases during the quarter, including 46 new deals, consistent with our long-term average.
So far this year we've signed 140 new deals, which puts us on pace to eclipse our annual high watermark.
Plus, we signed 83,000 square feet of first gen leases on the development pipeline.
In addition to healthy volume, rents on signed leases increased 19.3% on a GAAP basis and 4.3% on a cash basis.
The weighted average term was also solid at 6.3 years reflecting growing confidence in the long-term value of the office for our customers.
However, if we look solely at the change in second gen net effective rents on signed deals from 2019 to 2021 year-to-date, the decline is roughly at the midpoint of the 5% to 10% average decline across our markets we've mentioned previously, which in our experience is also consistent with the typical recessionary patterns.
As you may have seen from local media reports, two customers in our top 20 announced this quarter plans to move out upon exploration and relocate to new developments.
Turning to our results, we delivered strong FFO of $0.96 per share in the third quarter.
Our same property cash NOI growth was also strong at 6.4%, including the repayment of temporary rent deferrals agreed to during the first months of the pandemic.
Excluding these repayments, same-property cash NOI growth would still have been a healthy 5.2%, consistent with last quarter.
In last night's release, we updated our 2021 FFO outlook to $3.73 to $3.76 per share, up $0.07 at the midpoint from our prior outlook and up $0.165 from our initial 2021 FFO outlook provided in February.
We also raised our same property cash NOI growth outlook to 6% to 7%, up more than 150 basis points at the midpoint from our prior outlook.
Moving to investments, as we previously disclosed, we acquired the office portfolio from PAC in late July for a total investment of $683 million, including planned near-term building improvements.
As you know, we plan to bring our balance sheet back to pre-acquisition levels by accelerating the sale of $500 million to $600 million of noncore assets by mid-2022.
We closed two dispositions for $120 million in the third quarter, bringing our total to $163 million since we first announced the acquisition.
We are confident we'll end the year toward the high end of our outlook of $250 million to $300 million.
Turning to development, we delivered our $285 million build-to-suit for Asurion in Nashville, the largest development project in Highwoods history.
Following the delivery of the Asurion build-to-suit, our $109 million development pipeline consists of Virginia Springs II in the Brentwood BBD of Nashville and Midtown West in the Westshore BBD of Tampa.
We signed 83,000 square feet of leases on these developments during the quarter, bringing leasing to 59% for both buildings.
We increased the low end of our development announcement outlook from 0 to $100 million, demonstrating the growing confidence we have in potential announcements before year-end.
The high end remains $250 million.
Our well-located land bank, which can support more than $2 billion of future development, is a true differentiator for Highwoods and will drive value creation over the long term.
We are thrilled to have acquired the remaining 77 acres of development land at Ovation in the Cool Springs district of Franklin, Tennessee, one of Nashville's BBDs, for a total purchase price of $57.8 million.
We delivered the $285 million Asurion project on budget and ahead of schedule; we acquired a $683 million portfolio of office properties with attractive long-term returns; since announcing the acquisition, we have sold $163 million of noncore properties at attractive valuations; we raised our quarterly dividend over 4%; we increased the midpoint of our FFO outlook $0.165 per share since the beginning of the year; and we did all this while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDAre ratio of 5.6 times.
This is also consistent with our markets being highlighted in the most recent addition of ULI and PwC's emerging trends in real estate and where we have a significant best-in-class workplace options across 11.8 million square feet in the BBDs of Nashville and Raleigh, which ranked number 1 and number 2, respectively, and where 44% of our third quarter NOI was generated.
At 90.4%, occupancy increased 90 basis points from last quarter and we foresee occupancy holding steady for the balance of the year.
With 140 new customers signing on to join the portfolio so far this year, led by engineering and healthcare/life science customers, we're enthusiastic about where their plans may take them with many new to the market and with plans for growth.
There continue to be more data points supporting our markets' open-for-business and let's-get-back-to-work mentality, such as JLL noting Atlanta, Charlotte and Nashville pushed above 2019 leasing levels and the Atlanta market posting a positive net absorption of 478,000 square feet for the quarter.
In Raleigh, we signed 135,000 square feet of leases for the quarter and activity there is off to a quick start in the fourth quarter.
Market vacancy decreased slightly year-over-year and market rents are up nearly 4%.
In Nashville, we signed 76,000 square feet of second generation leases and achieved quarter-end occupancy of 95.3%.
Our development team completed the new 553,000 square foot Asurion headquarters anchoring our Gulch Central mixed-use development that stretches the better part of three city blocks and is adjacent to Nashville's Amazon HQ2.
We signed 83,000 square feet of first generation leases at Virginia Springs II and Midtown West bringing the leased rate up from 59% from 24% last quarter.
As Ted mentioned, we have a sizable land bank that can support over $2 billion of future development.
Having completed nearly $1 billion of successful development since 2016, we're confident development will continue to drive future growth and value creation.
These 145 acres, already home to Mars PetCare's U.S. headquarters that we developed in 2019, represent one of the premier mixed-use opportunities in the nation and is where we can build an additional 1.2 million square feet of Class A office amid significant densities of complementary residential, retail and hotel uses.
In the third quarter, we delivered net income of $72.1 million or $0.69 per share, and FFO of $102.8 million or $0.96 per share, an increase from $0.93 in the second quarter.
As Ted mentioned, we closed on the acquisition from PAC in late July, delivered the $285 million Asurion development in September and sold $120 million of noncore assets at the end of the quarter.
However, we are very pleased that our debt-to-EBITDAre was 5.6 times in the third quarter, less than half-a-turn increase at 5.2 times in the prior quarter.
We are making solid progress on our noncore disposition plan, having sold $163 million of the planned $500 million to $600 million, and are on track to return our balance sheet to pre-acquisition metrics by mid-2022.
Further, we have ample liquidity with $615 million currently available on our revolving credit facility, limited debt maturities until late 2022 and expected disposition proceeds over the next several quarters.
During the quarter, we issued a modest amount of shares on the ATM at an average price of $45.81 per share for net proceeds of $6.8 million, consistent with the ATM activity in the second quarter.
As Ted mentioned, we increased the low end of our development announcement outlook to $100 million, signifying our growing confidence in future development starts.
Regarding our expectations for the rest of the year, we've updated our 2021 FFO outlook to $3.73 to $3.76 per share, with the mid-point up $0.07 since July and up $0.165 from our original 2021 outlook provided in February.
Rolling forward from our prior outlook in July, the rationale for the increase was: $0.01 higher per share impact from the combination of the acquisition and corresponding noncore dispositions; $0.01 to $0.02 higher per share impact due to earlier-than-expected delivery of the Asurion build-to-suit; and $0.04 to $0.05 higher per share impact from core operations due to our robust third quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of the year.
Compared to our original FFO outlook provided in February, here are the major moving parts: $0.05 to $0.07 higher per share impact from acquisition and disposition activity on a net basis; $0.03 to $0.05 from the early delivery of Asurion and faster-than-expected lease-up of the remainder of the development pipeline; approximately $0.02 from rising parking revenues, particularly transient parking; and $0.04 to $0.05 from better-than-expected core operations.
In addition to our improved 2021 FFO outlook, we also increased our same-property cash NOI growth outlook to a range of 6% to 7%, up more than 150 basis points at the midpoint from our July outlook.
Since 2016, we've sold nearly $1.8 billion of noncore properties, we've acquired $1.3 billion of high-quality assets in the BBDs of our Sun Belt markets and delivered $940 million of development.
The strengthening of our cash flows since 2016 is evidenced by a 22% increase in average in-place cash rents, an 18% increase in our dividend, and a steadily declining payout ratio over that same time frame.
Our strengthening cash flows and continuous portfolio improvement combined with a land bank that can support $2 billion of future development and our proven track record as a developer makes us confident about our long-term outlook.
