For the third quarter, we earned $84.4 million of total revenue, an increase of 27.6%; $37.3 million of total Field EBITDA, an increase of 45% with total Field EBITDA margins improving 530 basis points to 44.2%.
Adjusted consolidated EBITDA improved $10.4 million or 60.1% to $27.7 million.
And our industry-leading adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin improved 670 basis points to 32.8%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased an impressive 82.1% to $0.51 in the quarter.
Year-to-date, total revenue has increased 17.9% to $239.4 million.
Total Field EBITDA has increased 24% to $100.6 million.
Total Field EBITDA margin increased 200 basis points to 42%.
Adjusted consolidated EBITDA increased 32.3% to $75.9 million.
Adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin increased 340 basis points to 31.7%.

Funeral Home same-store net revenue was up 3.3% September year-to-date while same-store Field EBITDA was up 9.6%, propelling the September year-to-date Funeral Home same-store margin from 38.4% to 40.7%, an increase of 230 basis points.
After finishing quarter two behind $1.9 million in Cemetery same-store operating net revenue, largely due to the cancellation of our annual Ching Ming event, we were able to closed the gap in quarter three to within 250,000 operating net revenue and bring our same-store margins from being behind $1.6 million in quarter two to being flat on a year-to-date basis.
In quarter three, we continue to see an increase in sales at our three new Cemetery acquisitions, increasing operating net revenue 28.7% from quarter two, improving margin of 35.4% in quarter two to 44.7% in quarter three, bringing the year-to-date margin to 38.1%.
In addition, we increased our number of funeral homes that offer live streaming from only 30 to now 125 in an effort to overcome restrictions and give our families, that don't feel safe attending a service in person, an opportunity to participate in the service virtually.
A vast majority of our same-store funeral homes had market share growth on a year-to-date basis and approximately 75% of those businesses had market share growth beyond COVID.
On a same-store basis, we saw an increase in our burial average of 3% in the third quarter versus the second quarter and an increase in cremation average of 6.4%.
The recurring annual income generated from our trust fund portfolio is currently $15.7 million, up from approximately $9.4 million prior to the execution of our strategy.
Initially, this 67% increase in recurring annual income will primarily benefit our recognized revenue through our cemetery perpetual care trust, while increasing the value of preneed funeral and cemetery trust contracts to be recognized over the long term.
For the third quarter, financial revenue increased 44.5% to $5.6 million, driven by a 111% increase in cemetery trust earnings.
Financial EBITDA increased 51.6% to $5.2 million and financial EBITDA margin increased 440 basis points to 93.8% compared to the third quarter of last year.
Next year, we expect financial revenue to be between $22 million and $23 million and financial EBITDA of approximately $21.5 million, an almost 50% increase from our financial EBITDA prior to the execution of our repositioning strategy.
Overhead increased $1.1 million while overhead as a percentage of revenue, the measure of our ability to leverage our overhead and support platform, fell to 11.8% in the third quarter.
Our managing partners and their teams are able to share in the local profits of their business with no overhead allocations when they achieve at least 50% of their annual standards for our Being The Best incentive program.
For the quarter, our adjusted free cash flow increased 120.3% to $27.6 million and our adjusted free cash flow margin expanded 1,370 basis points to 32.7%.
We were able to pay down $37.5 million in debt during this third quarter, equal to 7.4% of our debt outstanding at the beginning of the quarter.
This included the repurchase of $3.6 million of our 2.75% subordinated convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions.
For the year, we have paid down $63 million of debt, which is equal to 11.8% of our total debt outstanding post the close of Oakmont Memorial Park and Mortuary on January 3.
And we now expect our total debt outstanding to be approximately $460 million by the end of the year.
Our net debt to pro forma adjusted consolidated EBITDA fell to 4.8 times at the end of the quarter due to the accelerating growth in our adjusted consolidated EBITDA, combined with a large amount of debt reduction through the quarter.
We expect our leverage ratio to be approximately 4.5 times by year-end and below four times by year-end 2021.
During the third quarter, we divested six businesses for total proceeds of $7.3 million.
We currently expect to sell approximately 20 businesses or excess real estate for total proceeds of around $17 million and be substantially complete by the time we look to execute a refinancing transaction in the second quarter of next year.
Our debt repayment in the quarter was also helped by the receipt of a $7 million federal tax refund related to tax law changes made in the recently passed CARES Act.
We expect to receive an additional $1 million refund prior to the end of the year and we will be a full cash taxpayer again in 2021.
Our rapidly improving credit profile positions Carriage to execute a refinancing transaction of our existing 6.625% unsecured high-yield notes when they become callable on June one of next year.
We expect this transaction to reduce our interest cost by a minimum of 200 basis points, reduce our cash interest cost by a minimum of $8 million and add a minimum of $0.29 of earnings per share on an annual basis.
We are pleased and excited to announce the decision by our Board of Directors to increase our annual dividend by $0.05 to $0.40 per share.
This increase marks the second $0.05 increase in our dividend since the onset of the coronavirus crisis and should be viewed as an additional sign of confidence in our future performance.
At $0.40 per share, our annual dividend payments will be $7.2 million per year and represent approximately 10% of our projected 2022 adjusted free cash flow.
Beyond 2022, we will target a dividend policy of approximately 10% of our adjusted free cash flow and a 1% dividend yield on the market price of Carriage shares.
We expect to achieve important company performance milestones of over $100 million in adjusted consolidated EBITDA and industry-leading 32% adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin and earn over $60 million of adjusted free cash flow this year whereas we previously expected those milestones to be met in 2021 and 2022.
We also now expect to earn between $1.80 and $1.85 in adjusted diluted earnings per share this year, growing to between $2.15 and $2.25 in 2021 and growing further to $2.48 to $2.60 in 2022, when we have the full year effect of a lower cost capital structure.
For example, in explaining the financial impact of a proactive matter one of our attorneys has been working on for some time, he recently briefed me by saying, "Steve, that recovery is going to come in around $0.01 a share".
So he's referencing one year ago today, when we closed the day before the acquisition of Rest Haven, which was founded 50 years ago by Dewayne.
But I can truthfully say that in these last 12 months, my belief in Carriage as well as my admiration and respect for you and Shawn has grown.
It was founded 62 years ago by Mike's grandfather.
