National Fuel had an excellent second quarter with operating results of $1.34 per share, up 38% year-over-year.
In addition, last summer's Tioga County acquisition continues to exceed our expectations with gathering throughput and Appalachian production up over 45%.
Increased [Technical Issues] to $4.05 per share, at the midpoint an increase of 35% in the prior year.
Once complete, this project will generate about $50 million of annual revenue for us.
This timing will allow Seneca to capture the premium winter pricing typically seen in the Transco Zone 6 market.
Also in March, our Utility announced greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for its delivery system of 75% by 2030 and 90% by 2050, both from 1990 levels.
The targets rely on our commitment to the continued modernization of our utility infrastructure which today has led to a reduction in EPA Subpart W emissions of well over 60%.
Seneca produced a Company record 85.2 Bcfe, driven by increased Tioga County volumes from the acquisition completed last summer as well as growth in solid production results from our ongoing Appalachian development program.
During the quarter we brought online [13] new wells in Pennsylvania, all of which were in our Western Development Area.
During the quarter we also drilled 14 new wells, 10 in the WDA, four in the EDA.
We also continue to see the benefits of our increased scale with cash operating expenses dropping to $1.09 per Mcfe, a 14% decrease from the prior year.
Of note, we have realized a significant decrease in per unit G&A expense, dropping roughly 25% over the past year, driven by our acquisition and ongoing development in Appalachia.
In addition, we continue to make strides in improving our operational efficiencies, particularly in Tioga County, where our operations team has cut Utica drilling time by 25% compared to our last Tract 007 Pad.
On the marketing front, although pricing has been relatively volatile, Seneca is very well hedged for the balance of the fiscal year with 88% of our East Division gas production locked in physically and financially.
So all in, about 95% of our forecasted gas production is already sold.
That leaves a relatively small amount of production, less than 10 Bcf, exposed to in-basin spot pricing.
This has significantly increased Seneca's flexibility to move more gas to premium Dominion and Empire markets versus the weaker TGP 300 Zone 4 market.
As we look a bit further out, we have maintained our disciplined approach to hedging and already have 188 Bcf of fixed price firm sales, NYMEX swaps and costless collars in place for fiscal 2022.
We expect our annual capital levels in California will be in the $10 million to $20 million range over the next few years absent further increases in the longer-term oil strip.
And we are constructing another facility in South Midway Sunset which will provide about 30% of our field electricity use.
National Fuel's second quarter GAAP earnings were $1.23 per share.
When you back out items impacting comparability, principally related to the premium paid for the early redemption of our $500 million December '21 maturity, our operating results were $1.34 per share, a significant increase over last year.
In February, we issued $500 million of 2.95% 10-year notes, the proceeds from which were used to fund the early redemption of our $500 million, 4.9% coupon December '21 maturity.
Combining this with our $1 billion in short-term committed credit facilities and our expectation on meaningful future cash flow generation, we're in a great spot from a liquidity position.
While this debt issuance will translate into $2.5 million of interest savings per quarter going forward, the fiscal 2021 impact is somewhat muted by the overlapping period during the second quarter where both the redeemed notes and the new issue were on our balance sheet.
As it relates to the rest of the year, based on our strong second quarter results, we've increased our earnings guidance to a range of $3.85 to $4.05 per share, up $0.15 at the midpoint.
At our regulated companies, consistent with our earlier guidance, we anticipate O&M expense to be up approximately 4% in both our Utility and Pipeline and Storage segments.
For our non-regulated businesses, we now expect Seneca's full year LOE to range between $0.82 and $0.84 per Mcfe, a $0.01 lower at the midpoint of our revised guidance range.
On the gathering side of our business costs were in line with prior expectations and we still anticipate O&M to be in line with our earlier $0.09 per Mcf guidance.
As we look to the back half of the year and beyond, we would expect that DD&A trends closer to the low $0.60 per Mcfe area.
With respect to consolidated capital spending, All of our segment ranges remain the same and we are still projecting between $720 million and $830 million for the fiscal year.
