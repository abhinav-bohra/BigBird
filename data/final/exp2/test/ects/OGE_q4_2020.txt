We anticipate the regulatory asset that will be created as a result of the storm to be in the range of approximately $800 million to $1 billion.
We have secured $1 billion of additional bank financing or liquidity to cover these costs.
Since Enable's formed in 2013, we returned a modest investment into over $1 billion after-tax benefit to shareholders, which is equivalent to a 2.5 times after-tax return.
When the merger closes, we will own approximately 3% of the much more liquid limited partnership units of Energy Transfer.
Energy Transfer will acquire the general partner interest from us at some point for $10 million in aggregate cash consideration, and also CenterPoint will pay us $30 million.
We also reported earnings of $1.70 at the high end of our revised guidance, and ongoing earnings from OGE holdings of $0.37 per share.
Our 2021 utility guidance range is $1.76 to $1.86 per share.
The midpoint of this guidance is $1.81 per share and is based off 2.4% normalized load growth from 2020 and is equivalent to a 5% earnings per share growth rate.
We continued our impressive customer growth rate, and our customer base grew by 1.1%.
In December, the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported at Fort Smith, Arkansas had an unemployment rate of 4.4%.
Oklahoma City had the seventh lowest unemployment rate for large metropolitan areas at 4.8% and while the state of Oklahoma's unemployment rate came in at 5.3%, showing the strength and resilience of the economies across our service territory.
In 2020, we had 25 projects, 8,000 additional jobs in our service territory and $725 million of capital investment by businesses in our service territory.
We've invested $3.3 billion in our system.
If you look at our '21 guidance for O&M, it's approximately $29 million below our original guidance in 2020.
We returned $1.4 billion of cash for shareholders in the form of dividends and delivered a 5% compound annual growth rate at Utility.
We've cut our CO2 emissions by greater than 40%.
When you look over the last five or 10 years, we've delivered compounding annual growth rates between 5% and 6%, and we expect to keep true to our commitment to deliver on our earnings growth target of 5% by investing in lower-risk investments that improve our customers' experience.
By honoring our frontline healthcare heroes, our healthcare workers have earned the title Hero, especially throughout the last year, and we're proud to make a $100,000 donation this month to support their critical efforts.
As Sean mentioned, in order to keep life-sustaining power on for our customers during the 11 days when temperatures were between 23 and 45 degrees below average, the company incurred in the range of $800 million to $1 billion in fuel and purchase power costs.
From a funding standpoint, while we already have a $900 million credit facility in place, we felt it important to obtain an incremental funding source.
And this week, we closed on a $1 billion credit commitment agreement that will allow for ample liquidity.
In Oklahoma, we are allowed to file for intra-year adjustments to the cost once fuel and purchase power costs exceed $50 million and under or over collections in a year.
On slide 11, you can see that for the full year 2020, we achieved ongoing net income of $416 million or $2.08 per share as compared to net income of $434 million or $2.16 per share in 2019.
On a GAAP basis, OGE Energy Corp. reported a loss of $174 million or $0.87 per share, reflecting the impairment charge recorded on our Enable midstream investment in the first quarter of 2020.
OG&E's ongoing 2020 results were $0.04 lower than 2019 as unfavorable late summer weather lowered earnings compared to the prior year by $0.11.
We also continued to see steady earnings growth from our Arkansas formula rate plan, which contributed $0.02 of earnings in 2020.
On our third quarter call, we revised our 2020 OG&E utility guidance through a narrowed range of $1.68 to $1.70 per share.
In on our third quarter call, we indicated an expectation of full year load declines of 1.6%, and we finished the year at about that level.
Importantly, customer growth was 1.1% in 2020, providing a solid foundation for load growth in 2021.
On slide 13, we look ahead to 2021 load expectations and forecast customer load to be 2.4% above 2020 levels and about 0.5% above 2019 levels.
As we headed into February, we had great confidence in our ability to deliver $1.81 of earnings per share at OG&E, which is in line with our previous guidance of a 5% growth annually off of our 2019 baseline of $1.65.
We continue to have confidence in our ability to grow at 5% long term and expect 2022 earnings per share to be in line with the 5% growth from the midpoint of our 2021 guidance of $1.81.
Our initial $1.81 earnings per share guidance for 2021 assumes normal weather, solid load growth, as I just discussed, along with earnings contributions from our grid enhancement and other recovery mechanisms in Oklahoma.
Approximately 3% of our load is associated with this program, whereby variabilities in fuel and purchase power costs are not trued up.
The net effect on margins for the month of February is expected to be an unfavorable $0.06 of EPS.
Lastly, we expect to incur approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of incremental financing costs associated with the aforementioned $1 billion debt facility.
We will refine these estimates in the coming weeks while also exploring ways to mitigate this $0.10 of earnings per share headwind, and we'll provide an update on 2021 guidance during our first quarter call.
And while our five-year capital plan is 15% higher than one we shared with you a year ago driven by the infrastructure needs of our communities, we expect to see additional investment opportunities evolve over the planning period.
Our growing customer base and constructive regulatory framework provide us confidence in our ability to achieve a 5% OG&E earnings per share growth rate through 2025.
Our credit metrics are estimated to be between 18.5% and 20% over the next three years, and we believe we will receive constructive regulatory treatment on the fuel and purchase power costs recently incurred and that the result of credit metrics will remain strong.
