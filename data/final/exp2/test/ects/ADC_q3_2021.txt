I'm very pleased to report that we achieved record investment volume of approximately $1.1 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 with continued momentum heading into the 4th quarter of this year.
While our investment activities further strengthen our best-in-class retail portfolio we have also fortified our robust balance sheet with $1.5 billion of capital markets transactions year-to-date positioning our company for dynamic growth in the quarters ahead.
Notably, we completed our inaugural preferred equity offering during the 3rd quarter, raising $175 million at a 4.25% coupon.
During the 3rd quarter, we invested approximately $343 million in 83 high quality retail net lease properties across our 3 external growth platforms, 80 of these properties were sourced through our acquisition platform representing acquisition volume of over $340 million.
The 80 properties acquired during the 3rd quarter are leased to 49 tenants operating in 20 distinct retail sectors including best in class operators and off-price retail, convenience stores, tire and auto service, home improvement, auto parts, grocery, and general merchandise.
The acquired properties at a weighted average cap rate of 6.2% and a weighted average lease term of 10.7 years.
As mentioned, through the first 9 months of the year, we've invested a record $1.1 billion in 226 retail net lease properties spanning 40 states across the country and 26 retail sectors.
While raising the lower end of our acquisition guidance for the year to $1.3 billion our thoughtful and disciplined approach is evidenced by the nearly one-third of annualized base rents acquired year-to-date derived from ground lease assets and roughly 70% of annualized base rents acquired derived from leading investment grade retailers.
We're excited about the opportunity to add yet another Amazon Fresh store to the portfolio located in a prominent Chicago suburb with median household incomes of 110,000 and a daytime population of roughly 225,000 within a 5-mile radius.
During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a 9-property portfolio of Thorntons Convenience Stores for approximately $21 million.
The stores which are paying an average annual rent of only $120,000 per year and had a weighted average lease term of close to 20 years are all well located in the Nashville and Chicago MSAs.
Shortly after executing a letter of intent to purchase this portfolio, BP announced they're taking full ownership of Thorntons convenience store chain after 2.5 years as part of a joint venture established in 2019.
This transaction makes BP, which is an A minus rated company by S&P, one of the leading convenience store operators in the Midwest with more than 200 stores across 6 states.
We have acquired 73 ground leases year-to-date for total investment spend of nearly $350 million representing nearly 31% of acquisition spent for the entire year.
This includes 28 ground leases during the 3rd quarter representing investment volume of over $108 million.
As of September 30, our ground lease exposure reached a record of nearly 14% of annualized base rents.
The ground lease portfolio now derives roughly 87% from investment grade tenants and has a weighted average lease term of 12.1 years, with an average rent of less than 10 dollars per square foot.
This is a very compelling comparison when thinking about the value of our ground lease portfolio, which is a weighted average credit rating of BBB plus over 2 years of additional term in comparison to the Bloomberg BBB index and internal growth of nearly 1%.
As of September 30, our portfolio's total investment grade exposure was approximately 67% representing close to 100 basis point year-over-year increase.
On a 2-year stacked basis, our investment grade exposure has improved by roughly a 1,000 basis points.
We had 7 development in PCS projects either completed or under construction during the first 9 months of the year that represent total committed capital of approximately $40 million.
Construction continued during the 3rd quarter on 2 development in PCS projects with anticipated cost of just over $5 million.
We continue to reduce exposure to franchise restaurants and non-core tenants through the disposition of 3 properties for total gross proceeds of approximately $11.8 million with a weighted average cap rate of 6.3%.
As of September 30, we've disposed of 13 properties for gross proceeds of just over $48 million and are maintaining our disposition guidance of $50 million to $75 million for the year.
Their efforts have reduced our 2021 maturities to just 4 leases, representing 10 basis points of annualized base rents.
During the 3rd quarter, we executed new leases, extensions or options in approximately 72,000 square feet of gross leasable area.
Through the first 9 months of the year, we executed new leases, extensions, or options on approximately 347,000 square feet of gross leasable space.
Our 2022 lease maturities are de minimis with only 19 leases maturing representing less than 1% of annualized base rents expiring over the course of the next year.
As of September 30, our expanding retail portfolio consisted of 1338 properties across 47 states, including 162 ground leases and remains effectively fully occupied at 99.6%.
For those that have been following our company over the years, this reduction in Walgreens exposure is a true milestone given our historical exposure which once approached 40% of our portfolio.
Over the course of his career, Mike has raised in excess of $50 billion of capital through numerous transactions.
Core funds from operations for the 3rd quarter was $0.92 per share, representing a 13% year-over-year increase.
Adjusted funds from operations per share for the quarter increased 11.5% year-over-year to $0.89.
As mentioned on the last 2 calls, we expect to achieve high single-digit earnings growth for full year AFFO per share.
Building upon our 6% AFFO per share growth in 2020, this implies 2 year stack growth in the mid teens.
During the 3rd quarter, we declared monthly cash dividends of [Phonetic] $0.217 per common share for July, August and September.
On an annualized basis, the monthly dividends represent an 8.5% increase over the annualized dividend from the 3rd quarter of last year.
While meaningfully increasing the common dividend over the past year, we maintained conservative payout ratios for the 3rd quarter of 71% of core FFO per share and 70% of AFFO per share respectively.
Subsequent to quarter end, we again increased the monthly cash dividend by 4.6% to $0.227 per common share for October.
The monthly dividend reflects an annualized dividend amount of $2.72 per share or 9.8% increase over the annualized dividend amount of $2.48 per share from the 4th quarter of 2020.
On a 2-year stack basis, this reflects annualized dividend growth of more than 15%.
General and administrative expenses for the 3rd quarter which were impacted by recent changes to the company's executive officers totaled $5.7 million.
G&A expense was 6.5% of total revenue or 6% excluding the noncash amortization of above and below-market lease intangibles.
While we continue to invest in people and systems to support our dynamic and growing business, we still anticipate that G&A as a percentage of total revenue will be roughly 7% for full year 2021.
As mentioned last quarter, G&A expense for our acquisitions team fluctuates based on acquisition volume for the year and our current anticipation for G&A expense reflects acquisition volume within our new guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.
Total income tax expense for the 3rd quarter was approximately $390,000, which was slightly lower than our expectation.
We continue to anticipate total income tax expense for 2021 to be close to $2.5 million.
Moving onto our capital markets activities for the quarter, as Joey mentioned, in September, we completed our inaugural preferred equity offering raising $175 million of gross proceeds at a record low coupon of 4.25.
During the 3rd quarter, we entered into forward sale agreements in connection with our ATM program to sell an aggregate of approximately 367,000 shares of common stock for anticipated net proceeds of roughly $27 million.
During the quarter, we also settled close to 886,000 shares under forward ATM sale agreements and received net proceeds of approximately $56 million.
At quarter end, we had approximately 3.4 million shares remaining to be settled under existing forward sale agreements which are anticipated to raise net proceeds of more than $226 million upon settlement.
Inclusive of the settlement of our outstanding forward equity, our fortified balance sheet stood at approximately 3.7 times net debt to recurring EBITDA.
Excluding the impact of our unsettled forward equity, our net debt to recurring EBITDA was approximately 4.4 times.
At September 30, total debt to enterprise value is just under 25%, while our fixed charge coverage increased to a record 5.1 times.
With full availability under our revolving credit facility and nearly $830 million in total liquidity, we have tremendous flexibility to execute on our growth plans.
