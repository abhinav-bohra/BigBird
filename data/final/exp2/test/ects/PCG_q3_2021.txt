This quarter, we delivered non-GAAP core earnings of $0.24 per share.
We are reaffirming our 2021 non-GAAP core earnings per share guidance of $0.95 to $1.05, and we no longer expect to issue equity in 2021.
We continue to see rate base growth of 8.5% and longer-term earnings-per-share growth of 10%.
In fact, when we backcast our current model to the previous utility caused fires between 2012 and 2020, we would have prevented 96% of the structure damage had the current model been in place.
In fact, since the end of July through mid-October, we saw 46% decrease in CPUC reportable ignitions in high fire threat districts and an 80% reduction in ignitions on enabled circuits.
In 2019, we had seven events that impacted over 2 million customers.
Since then, we've installed approximately 1,300 weather stations, 500 high definition cameras and over 1,100 sectionalizing devices to better pinpoint exactly where we need to initiate PSPS.
As you can see on slide 5, our model shows that by backcasting our new 2021 PSPS algorithm on to 2012 through 2020, we would have prevented 96% of the structure damage from fires caused by overhead electrical equipment in our service area.
What we've seen is a 46% reduction in CPUC reportable ignitions in our high fire threat districts from the end of July through mid-October.
On the specific circuits where we first implemented the enhanced powerline safety settings, we've seen an 80% decrease in ignitions over the same time period.
On Monday, October 11, we initiated a PSPS event that affected about 20,000 people.
The wins came in as forecasted, and in 33 instances, outside of the PSPS zones and the highest wind areas, our lines automatically de-energized due to the unpredictable disturbances and potential risk was mitigated.
As you can see, we're on track to complete our enhanced inspections on 0.5 million assets in 2021 in our high fire threat areas.
These inspections are scheduled to be conducted every year on all assets in Tier 3 and every three years for all assets in Tier 2.
In 2021, we plan to complete 1800 miles of enhanced vegetation management work, combined with what we completed in 2019 and 2020 adds up to over 6,000 miles by the end of this year.
In the last three months, we've made great progress against our multi-year 10,000 mile undergrounding program.
In September, we completed undergrounding powerlines in Santa Rosa, which resulted in 11,000 customers who will no longer be impacted by PSPS.
I'll repeat what we said since Investor Day, our actions around Dixie were those of a reasonable operator and we're confident in the framework created by AB 1054.
AB 1054 resulted in a wildfire fund to provide liquidity for resolved claims, a maximum liability cap for reimbursement by investor-owned utilities and enhanced prudency standards when determining that reimbursement amount.
We're reflecting that view in our financial statements which show a gross charge of $1.15 billion.
We booked an offsetting $1.15 billion receivable that reflects our confidence to recover costs.
For example, our team just last week responded to an atmospheric river weather event that included among the highest rainfall totals observed in a 48 hour timeframe ranging from 16 inches at Mount Tam [Phonetic] to 5 inches in downtown Sacramento.
The strongest wind gust recorded was 92 miles per hour from Mines Tower in Alameda County with at least a dozen other locations experiencing gust greater than 69 miles per hour.
Even in the face of these difficult conditions, we completed our work without any serious safety incidents while returning service to 632,000 of the 851,000 customers impacted within 12 hours.
Our full year guidance as always assumed a GAAP positive year and our full year non-GAAP core earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05 per share, reflects our fully diluted share count.
We continue to be on track for the 2021 non-GAAP operating earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05.
Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.24.
We recorded a GAAP loss of $0.55 including non-core items.
This quarter, we recorded a $1.3 billion charge we've previously guided to as a result of our grantor trust election.
As Patti mentioned, we took a $1.15 billion charge this quarter for the Dixie fire.
We also recorded a $1.15 billion of offsetting receivables.
On slide 11, we show the quarter-over-quarter comparison for non-GAAP core earnings of $0.24 per share for Q3 2021 versus $0.22 per share for Q3 2020.
EPS increased due to $0.03 of growth in rate base earnings, $0.02 from using basic share count as a result of the GAAP loss I mentioned earlier and $0.01 from lower wildfire our litigation costs, partially offset by $0.01 decrease due to timing of taxes that will net to zero over the year.
We are reaffirming our non-GAAP core earnings per share of $0.95 to $1.05.
On the debt side, we expect to complete an initial AB 1054 securitization transaction this month, for $860 million.
At the end of the third quarter, we've requested cost recovery for approximately 80% of the unrecovered wildfire related costs on our balance sheet.
And we already have final decision, settlement agreements or interim rates for roughly 60%.
Our request was $1.28 billion comprised of prior wildfire expense including costs that were incurred in 2018.
Given some of these cost predate the wildfire mitigation plan construct, we feel that settlement of $1.04 billion is a reasonable outcome.
Most recently on this front, in September, we felt the recovery of $1.4 [Phonetic] billion of additional wildfire mitigation and catastrophic event costs.
EV Charge 2 is an extension of our fully subscribed and successful EV Charge Network Program.
We are requesting a total revenue requirement for roughly $225 [Phonetic] million from 2023 through 2030.
This phase of the program will provide the infrastructures to support 16,000 new charging ports which is just scratching the surface to meet the demands of our customers.
Till [Phonetic] today are driving nearly 20% of the electric vehicles in the country.
