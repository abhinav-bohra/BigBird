We further strengthened connections with customers, landing record new logos and delivering our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 million of bookings.
Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet by raising approximately $600 million of low coupon Swiss green bonds and over $1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth.
Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3.
We also advanced our sustainable financing strategy, raising our first-ever Swiss green bonds and publishing the allocation of $440 million of proceeds from our September 2020 Euro green bond, which funded sustainable data center development projects in four countries across three continents, certified in accordance with leading sustainable rating standards.
Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4.
As of September 30, we had 44 projects underway around the world, totaling almost 270 megawatts of incremental capacity, with over 250 megawatts scheduled for delivery before the end of 2022.
We continue to invest most heavily in EMEA, where we now have 27 projects underway in 15 different markets, totaling 150 megawatts of incremental capacity, most of which is highly connected, including significant expansions in Frankfurt, Marseille, Paris, and Zurich.
We're seeing strong demand in Portland, where we have a 30-megawatt facility under construction that is 100% preleased and scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of next year, while we also have significant projects underway in Northern Virginia, New York, and Toronto.
The larger second facility will accommodate up to 64 megawatts of capacity and will be located within 25 kilometers of our first facility.
Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5.
Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7.
For the second straight quarter, we signed total bookings of 113 million.
This time, with a 12 million contribution from interconnection.
Deal mix was consistent with the prior four-quarter average, sub-1 megawatt deals plus interconnection represented about 40% of the total, while larger deals represented around 60%.
Space and power bookings were also well diversified by region, with EMEA and APAC contributing 45% of our total, about the same as the Americas, with interconnection accounting for the remaining 10%.
The weighted average lease term was a little over five and a half years, and we landed a record 140 new logos during the third quarter, with strong showings across all regions, demonstrating the power of our global platform.
And finally, a Global 500 fintech provider is expanding their own hybrid IT availability zones into multiple new metros, using PlatformDIGITAL to support their data-intensive and high-performance computing requirements.
Turning to our backlog on Page 9.
The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from 303 million to 330 million, and our third-quarter signings more than offset commencements.
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10.
We signed 223 million of renewal leases during the third quarter, our largest ever renewal quarter, in addition to new leases signed.
Renewal rates for sub-1 megawatt deals remain consistently positive, greater than the megawatt renewals were skewed by our largest deal of the core that combined a sizable 30-megawatt renewal with our largest new deal for the quarter, which will land entirely in existing currently vacant or soon to be vacant capacity across Chicago and Ashburn.
Excluding this one transaction, our cash mark-to-market would have been a positive 1%.
In terms of first-quarter operating performance, reported portfolio occupancy ticked down by 50 basis points, largely driven by the sale of fully leased assets during the quarter.
Upon commencement of the large combination renewal expansion list I mentioned a moment ago, portfolio occupancy is expected to improve by 70 basis points.
Same capital cash NOI growth was negative 5.5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a spike in property taxes in Chicago, where local assessors have adopted a very aggressive posture, along with the impact of the Ashburn churn event in January.
Of the 70 megawatts we got back on January 1st, approximately 80% has since been released to multiple large and growing customers.
Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 11.
In terms of earnings growth, third-quarter core FFO per share was up 7% on both a year over year and sequential basis, driven by strong operational execution, cost controls, and a reduction in financing costs from the debt refinancings and redemptions of preferred stock over the past year.
To avoid any confusion, our core FFO outperformance excludes the benefit of a nearly $20 million promote fee received in connection with the monetization of our joint venture with Prudential.
Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 12.
We continue to recycle capital by disposing of assets that have limited growth prospects, raising over 100 million in the third quarter for our 20% position in the Prudential JV and some land in Arizona.
We also raised approximately 95 million of common equity under our ATM program in July, as well as 950 million of common equity in a September forward equity offering.
Our reported leverage ratio remains at six times, but including committed proceeds from the September forward equity offering, the leverage ratio drops to 5.6 times, while our fixed charge coverage improves to six times.
As you can see from the chart on Page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is over six years and our weighted average coupon is down to 2.2%.
dollar-denominated, reflecting the growth of our global platform while also acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Over 90% of our debt is fixed rate, guarding against a rising rate environment.
And 98% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.
Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 14, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years.
