We also identified 70 branches for consolidation representing approximately 7% of our network.
We reported net income of $591 million or $0.61 per share for the first quarter.
On a per share basis, this is an increase of 9% from the fourth-quarter results and up significantly from the year-ago period.
We reached a new milestone in our consumer mortgage business with record loan originations of $3 billion for the quarter.
In addition to adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, consumer mortgage fees were up 135% from the year-ago period.
We reported a record $8.3 billion of originations in 2020, and we expect to eclipse that level this year.

This quarter, we repurchased $135 million of common shares.

As Chris said, it was a strong start to the year with net income from continuing operations of $0.61 per common share, up 9% from the prior quarter and over four times from the year-ago period.
Total average loans were $101 billion, up 5% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans.
PPP loans had an impact of $7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 average balances.
Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road and as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business with $3 billion of consumer mortgage loans this quarter.
Linked quarter average loan balances were down 1%, reflecting lower commercial utilization rates and a reduction in average PPP balances.
We had just under $1 billion of PPP forgiveness in the current quarter.

Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income decreased $31 million and the margin declined 9 basis points.
The decrease in net interest income was caused by the day count of approximately $14 million, lower loan fees of $8 million and lower loan balances resulting in an additional $8 million reduction to NII.

Record mortgage originations drove mortgage -- consumer mortgage fees this quarter, which were up $27 million or 135% from the first quarter of '20.
Cards and payments income also increased $39 million related to higher prepaid card activity from state government support programs as well as the growth in the core platform.
Other income in the year-ago period included $92 million of market-related valuation adjustments.
Compared to the fourth quarter, non-interest income decreased by $64 million.
Total non-interest expense for the quarter was $1.071 billion compared to $931 million last year and $1.1 billion in the prior quarter.
The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation, which increased $58 million and the increase in our stock price resulting in a $36 million increase compared to last year.

We ended the first quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.8%, which places us above our targeted range of nine to nine and a half perccent.
Our board of directors approved a first-quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share.
We also repurchased $135 million of common shares under the share repurchase authorization we announced in January of up to $900 million.
