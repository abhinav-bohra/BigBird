Compared to last year, fourth quarter earnings increased 13.7%.
Operating margin increased 173 basis points and free cash flow increased 50.7%.
Free cash flow increased significantly, 39.1% to $547.5 million.
It is worth emphasizing that full year margin and cash flow performance occurred despite over $33 million in nonrecurring charges, record negative GDP in the second quarter and the constant challenges faced by manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Q2 orders were $920 million or 1.14 times sales with year-end backlog of $1.7 billion.
Given some caution and conservatism, related to the ongoing tug of war between shutdowns and vaccines, we think a reasonable outlook for the total company's organic growth is between 5% and 6% for 2021.
We've been watching FLIR since we first entered the Space-based Infrared imaging market in 2006 when we acquired Teledyne Scientific and Imaging.
For example, Teledyne entered the subsea drone business in 2008 and FLIR entered the airborne unmanned business in 2016, and more recently, the land-based robotics business.
I will conclude by noting that for 21 years, Teledyne has consistently and predictably compounded earnings and cash flow, and 2020 was no different.
In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales decreased 6.2% when compared with last year.
Sales of environmental instruments decreased 6.7% from last year.
However, sales increased 6.9% sequentially from the third quarter.
Sales of electronic test and measurement systems increased 3.7% year-over-year to a quarterly record of $70 million.
Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 11.4% in the quarter, due in part to a difficult comparison with the fourth quarter of 2019.
In spite of lower sales, overall Instrumentation segment operating margin increased 262 basis points to a record, 22.3%.
Fourth quarter sales decreased 2.3%, and primarily reflect the core sales of X-ray detectors for dental and medical imaging, partially offset by greater sales of infrared and visible detectors for space applications.
GAAP segment operating margin was 21.6%, an increase of 407 basis points year-over-year and also, a record.
Now in the Aerospace and Defense segment, fourth quarter sales declined 14.8% as greater U.S. defense sales were more than offset by a 45% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products as well as lower commercial space sales related to OneWeb.
The GAAP segment operating margin decreased due to lower sales as well as $5.8 million in severance facility consolidation and other contract charges.
In the Engineered Systems segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 26.8%, primarily due to greater sales from defense, nuclear and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services.
Segment operating margin increased 175 basis points compared with last year.
In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $236.4 million compared with cash flow of $167.9 million for the same period of 2019.
