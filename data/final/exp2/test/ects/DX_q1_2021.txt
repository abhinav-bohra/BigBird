Our current total economic return for the quarter was 7.2% on a quarterly basis, and we have generated a total economic return of 34.8% over the last four quarters, averaging 8% per quarter.
Most importantly, since this new era in history began in January 2020, we have outperformed our industry and other income-oriented vehicles with a 27.1% total shareholder return as noted on Slide five.
This quarter was unique in providing us the opportunity to raise $128 million in new common equity and invest that capital accretive.
For the quarter, we recorded a comprehensive income of $1.76 per common share, a total economic return of $1.38 per common share or 7.2%, and a core net operating income of $0.46 per common share.
Overall, total shareholders' capital grew approximately $100 million or 15% during the quarter as we raised $128 million in net common equity through two public offerings, as Byron noted, redeemed $70 million in higher-cost preferred equity and added approximately $36 million in capital from excess economic return over dividends paid.
The excess economic return was largely driven by our hedging strategy as we actively managed our position and timed our hedging adjustments as the curve steepened during the quarter, resulting in gains of $166 million, more than offsetting the impact of higher rates in our investment portfolio.
Book value per common share during the quarter rose $0.99 or 5.2%.
Absent the cost of the equity raises, book value grew approximately 7.5% during the quarter.
Core net operating income to common shareholders sequentially improved this quarter to $0.46 from $0.45 in Q4, principally resulting from lower G&A expenses and the reduction in the preferred stock dividend with the redemption of the remaining $70 million in Series B preferred stock outstanding mid-quarter.
Average earning assets marginally increased to $4.3 billion as we opportunistically deployed the capital raise throughout the quarter.
At quarter-end, leverage was 6.9 times shareholders' equity, and earning assets were $5.2 billion.
The adjusted net interest spread was slightly lower at 187 basis points versus 198 basis points last quarter.
On the balance sheet, portfolio asset yields and TBA specialness were 12 basis points lower during the quarter, which was partially offset by the benefit from lower borrowing costs, which declined five basis points.
TBA drop income increased 33% during the quarter as we more heavily invested in TBAs, but at slightly lower net interest spreads as TBA specialness was lower in the quarter.
Agency RMBS prepayments speeds were 18.4 CPR for the quarter versus 17.1 CPR for Q4, while overall portfolio CPRs, including the CMBS portfolio, were approximately 14 CPR.
As of December 31, 2019, you can see that was at 1.92%.
That yield touched something like 50 basis points in the first quarter of 2020, and we've come all the way back to 1.74% at the end of the first quarter.
Again, on December 31, 2019, repo rates stood at 2%.
And now -- one-month repo rate now is sitting in the mid-teens, 14 basis points.
As Steve mentioned, book value increased to $1.44 or 7.5% on a gross basis, less $0.45 cost of the capital raises, we get to the net of $0.99 or 5.2% increase reported for the quarter.
Roughly 65% of the $1.44 or $0.90 of the book value increase was due to the portfolio positioning from the existing portfolio.
The other 35% of the book value increase came from the timely deployment of capital from the two raises.
We're ending the quarter with leverage at 6.9 times, up about 0.5 times from year-end.
Earning assets actually ended up quarter-over-quarter, almost $1.1 billion higher, including TBAs.
Peak month-end leverage during the quarter was 7.7 times.
You can see that on Page 11.
Post-quarter-end, we took some profits on our 30- and 15-year MBS TBA positions.
Leverage is about 6.1 times and book value is flat versus quarter-end.
On-Page 19, we have a pricing matrix that just goes through by coupon, what happened to various types of specified pools over the quarter.
We expect to see continued specialness in the two and 2.5 coupons well into the third quarter.
At the current leverage, which I mentioned, we had delivered post-quarter-end and balance sheet size, which is about $1 billion higher versus quarter-end -- versus year-end, we still expect core net operating income to continue to exceed the level of the dividend.
At this point, we're estimating, again, another two to three turns of capacity that offers additional total economic return power of anywhere between 1% to 3%.
And just as an example, one turn of leverage invested at 10% economic return is $0.24, which represents a meaningful upside to returns from today.
