During the course of our internal review related to the ongoing government investigation regarding House Bill 6, the Independent Review Committee of the Board determined that three executives violated certain FirstEnergy Policies and its Code of Conduct.
In my 36 years with the company, we have faced challenges and changes, and we have always emerged stronger and even more dedicated to our mission.
We remain on pace to complete more than $3 billion in customer-focused investments across our system this year and our business model and rate structure continue to provide stability.
Based on our strong performance year-to-date and the expectations for the next couple of months, we are affirming our guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and currently expect to be near the top end of that range.
If decoupling is part of a House Bill 6 repeal, we would be closer to the $2.50 per share midpoint.
We have updated our funds from operations and free cash flow forecast for 2020, to reflect the impacts of higher storm costs of approximately $145 million and higher costs associated with the pandemic, including uncollectibles of approximately $120 million, most of which are deferred for future recovery.
Although the events of this past week and the government investigations create additional uncertainty, we are affirming our expected CAGR of 6% to 8% through 2021 and 5% to 7% extending through 2023, along with our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually in 2022 and 2023.
If approved, we would begin installing 1.15 million smart meters and related infrastructure across our New Jersey service territory, over a three-year period beginning in 2023.
It includes a $94 million annual increase in distribution revenues, based on an ROE of 9.6%.
Prior to then, the rate increase will be offset through amortization of regulatory liabilities totaling approximately $86 million, beginning January 1st.
The parties also agreed that the net gains from the sale of JCP&L's interest in Yards Creek, estimated at $110 million, will be used to reduce the regulatory asset for previously deferred storm costs.
As Steve noted, operating earnings were a $0.01 above the top end of our earnings guidance range, largely reflecting the ongoing success of our regulated growth strategy, as well as benefits from weather.
Cooling degree days were approximately 21% above normal and relatively flat to the third quarter of 2019.
Total residential sales increased 5.3% on a weather-adjusted basis compared to the same period last year, as many people continued to work-from-home and spend more time at home due to the pandemic.
In the commercial customer class, sales decreased 5.5% on a weather-adjusted basis compared to the third quarter of 2019.
And in our industrial class, third quarter load decreased 6.3% compared to the same period last year.
Consistent with the trends we've seen for the past 12 months, the only sector showing growth in our footprint was shale gas.
Based on the asset returns through September 30th and a discount rate ranging from 2.7% to 3%, we estimate that adjustment to be between an after-tax loss of $330 million to a gain of $40 million.
Year-to-date, our return on assets is 9.2% versus our assumption of 7.5% and our funded status remains at 77%.
First, from a liquidity perspective, I'll remind you that we continue to have access to $3.5 billion of credit facilities committed through December 2022.
In addition, we expect our holding company debt to remain around 35% of total adjusted debt and we have no plans to increase debt at the FirstEnergy HoldCo.
Two years ago, at EEI, we announced a targeted payout ratio of 55% to 65% of our operating earnings.
In alignment with that policy, our Board raised a quarterly payout by $0.02 per share for dividends paid in 2019 and then by $0.01 per share for those paid in 2020.
Given our current yield of approximately 5%, we expect to hold our quarterly dividend at $0.39 per share or $1.56 per share on an annualized basis for next year.
This would represent a 59% payout ratio to our CAGR midpoint for 2021.
With respect to our overall capital programs, for 2021, our capex programs will be at the $3 billion level and we will consider reductions if necessary.
As Steve said, we are reaffirming our plan to issue up to $600 million in equity annually, in 2022 and 2023, and we will take the necessary actions financially to weather this uncertainty and put the company in the best position possible.
