Additionally, during the second quarter, we utilized our share buyback program and have now repurchased 175 million in common stock year to date.
We delivered an economic return of nearly 15% and achieved core earnings well in excess of our rightsized dividend.
The Fed's purchased an upwards of 850 billion MBS in just over four months has dramatically altered the supply and demand picture for the sector.
After a pace of purchases at the height of the volatility that reached nearly 50 billion per day to help stabilize the sector, the Fed has transitioned to a steady run rate of 40 billion per month, net of portfolio runoff, which on a gross basis, equates to roughly 40% current agency issuance.
And with respect to our hedges, we added to our swap portfolio, primarily in the front end, the short-term swaps with pay rates close to 0%, provide an attractive hedge to our financing.
We further reduced the LIBOR footprint of our hedge portfolio with our swap book now 80% in OIS and we reinitiated our treasury future short position that was unwound in the first quarter.
Non-agency securities across legacy, CRT, Jumbo 2.0 and non-QM have seen substantial recovery.
Our residential portfolio was roughly unchanged quarter over quarter at 2.6 billion as modest purchases and mark-to-market increases largely offset sales and portfolio runoff.
Securitization market started to show signs of life in mid-May, and we issued nearly 500 million of expanded prime securities earlier this month, subsequent to quarter end.
Aggregate issuance under our OBX shelf has now reached 4.5 billion across 11 transactions since 2018.
Cross sectors within commercial, the operating fundamentals remain challenged in hospitality as the average national occupancy rate hovers around 40%.
On a more positive note, multifamily remains strong throughout the quarter as the latest data indicates over 90% of renters made a full or partial rent payment as of June.
And in the office sector, although new leasing has slowed significantly, office REITs have reported strong rent collections above 90% throughout the back end of the second quarter.
With respect to our CRE portfolio, specifically, total assets at quarter end of 2.5 billion represented a slight decrease, while economic interest remained essentially flat.
The decline in portfolio size was driven by approximately 53 million in loan payoffs, as well as securities sales.
On the financing side, our weighted average cost of borrowing decreased by roughly 60 basis points to 2.7%, driven largely by a reduction in LIBOR given Fed cuts.
However, for context, first lien executions on larger transactions have tightened 75 to 100 basis points over the past quarter.
Despite the challenging environment, we are pleased with how the portfolio has performed during the period, ending the quarter essentially unchanged at 2.2 billion in assets.
Consequently, we reduced leverage during the quarter from 6.8 to 6.4 times and made the prudent decision to set our quarterly dividend at $0.22.
The dividend represents a 10.5% yield on our book value, which is in line with our historical average, while being competitive relative to our peers and various fixed income benchmarks.
As I mentioned, we outearned the dividend by $0.05 this quarter, and absent another market dislocation or other unforeseen developments, we expect Q3 core earnings to also exceed the dividend.
Our book value per share was $8.39 for Q2, a 12% increase from Q1, and we generated core earnings per share, excluding PAA, of $0.27, a 30% increase from the prior quarter.
Book value increased on GAAP net income of 856 million or $0.58 per share, which includes $0.05 related to CECL and specific reserves, and higher other comprehensive income of 721 million or $0.51 per share on improved valuations on agency MBS, resulting from lower market rates.
GAAP net income improved this quarter as a result of higher GAAP net interest income of 399 million, primarily due to lower interest expense from reduced repo rates and balances, and we also experienced lower losses on our swap portfolio of $92 million.
As a result, we ran numerous scenarios in excess of 20 to determine the appropriate amount of CECL reserves for the quarter and ultimately booked reserves that were considerably more conservative than our base case scenario.
We recorded reserves associated with our credit businesses of 68.8 million on funded commitments during the second quarter, consisting of 22 million of additional reserves during the quarter, primarily resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on our borrowers.
And more general reserves related to forecasts for a deterioration in economic conditions and market values of 46.8 million.
Total reserves now comprise 5.32% of our ACREG and MML loan portfolios as of June 30, 2020.
The largest factor quarter over quarter to core earnings ex PAA, were lower interest expense of 186 million versus 503 million in the prior quarter.
Due to lower average repo rates and balances, as well as higher TBA dollar roll over income of 96 million versus 44 million in the prior quarter.
Due to higher average balances, partially offset by higher expense from the net interest component of interest rate swaps of 65 million versus 14 million in the prior quarter on higher average notional balances.
As David touched on, our economic leverage declined to 6.4 times from 6.8 times quarter over quarter, which was mainly due to a decrease in repo balances of 5.4 billion and an increase in our equity base of 1.1 billion.
That was partially offset by an increase in TBA contracts of 5.8 billion and an increase in net payables for investments purchased of 1.5 billion.
Our treasury function is the best in the business, and their expertise and exemplary market timing was a key component that helped us weather the market dislocation last quarter and our ability to deliver strong core earnings this quarter -- additionally, as noted above, core did benefit from a reduction in financing costs with lower average repo rates down to 79 basis points from 1.77%, combined with lower average repo balances, down to 68.5 billion from $96.8 billion.
And we achieved these results while opportunistically extending our repo book term, increasing our weighted average days to maturity by 50% from 48 to 74 days.
Consistent with that strategy, since the beginning of the second quarter, we added 1.125 billion of capacity across two new credit facilities for our residential credit group for permanent nonrecourse financing.
The portfolio generated 188 basis points of NIM, up from Q1 of 118 basis points, driven primarily by the decrease in cost of funds that I mentioned a moment ago.
Annualized core return on average equity, excluding PAA, was 12.82% for the quarter in comparison to 9.27% for Q1.
Our efficiency metrics changed modestly relative to Q1 being 2.01% of equity for the second quarter in comparison to 1.98%.
Annaly ended the quarter with excellent liquidity profile with 7.9 billion of unencumbered assets, an increase of 1 billion from prior quarter, including cash and unencumbered agency MBS of 5.3 billion.
