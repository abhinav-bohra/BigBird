We announced another potash price increase in February, up $50 per ton, increasing our posted potash prices $140 per ton above summer fill levels.
Trio has also seen strong demand and has currently posted $60 per ton higher than the summer fill values.
We expect to produce water well will cost approximately $2 million and will complete incremental capital for the surface facility at the appropriate time.
Total capital for our first well and surface facilities is estimated at $7 million.
We expect additional wells can be added as demand and volume commitments require at a cost of approximately $2 million each.
We recorded fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $9.7 million, an increase of over $8 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Customers look to replenish potash inventories after a strong fall application season that was evidenced by the 78,000 tons of potash sold in the quarter up significantly from the prior year.
Looking toward 2021, we still expect first half potash volumes to exceed prior year by about 5% to 10% despite the large volumes in the fourth quarter.
All said, we expect our net realized pricing to increase from $248 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 300 to $310 per ton for the second quarter of 2021, with the first-quarter net realized sales price about halfway between the two.
Our posted price is now up $60 per ton compared to the summer fill levels, and we are seeing good subscription at current pricing into the spring.
We expect our net realized sales price will increase to approximately 220 to $230 per ton in the first quarter and 230 to $240 per ton in the second quarter of 2021.
Total water sales, including byproducts, were $5.8 million in Q4 an increase of $2.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Our debt position is unchanged since the third quarter with $55 million outstanding, of which $10 million relates to the PPP loan.
Availability under our credit facility was $20 million at year-end.
Cash flow from operations was $12.7 million in the fourth quarter and $31 million for the full year.
2020 capital investment ended the year at $16.4 million.
We estimate 2021 capital investment of 25 to 35 million, of which 12 to 15 million will be sustaining capital with the remainder as potential opportunity capital projects.
With a strong early start to the spring season, our cash position today is $28 million with no change in our outstanding debt from year-end.
