For the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, approximately $750 million of distributable cash flow and almost $400 million in net income on revenue of approximately $3.1 billion.
During the first quarter, we exported a quarterly record of 133 cargoes of LNG from our two facilities, with production incentivized by strong global LNG margins during the quarter, and we had the benefit of Corpus Christi Train three commissioning volumes.
We now forecast consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.30 to $4.6 billion, and distributable cash flow of $1.60 to $1.9 billion for the full year 2021.
In the four year period from 2017 to 2020 and the global LNG market added almost 120 million tons of capacity, an average of almost 30 million tons per year.
In the subsequent four year period, that average is expected to drop to approximately 11 million tons a year, a significant slowdown in supply growth, which will be amplified by output declines from older legacy projects.
On the demand side, the structural shift to gas on a global basis is evidenced by the near-term doubling of LNG importing nations in the last 10 years, and hundreds of billions of dollars of natural gas oriented infrastructure being built around the world today.
We forecast that global LNG trade will approximately double, expanding by approximately 350 million tons per annum to over 700 million tonnes per annum by 2040, which would support additional, approximately 225 million tons per annum of incremental global supply.
This year, we expect to generate well over $1 billion of free cash flow, and we are quickly approaching our expected run rate metrics.
Our run rate forecast of $11 per share and distributable cash flow not only has a high degree of visibility but also empowers us to execute on an all of the above strategy for capital allocation, which includes achieving investment-grade credit metrics, funding a significant portion of Corpus Christi Stage three with cash flow after that project is commercialized and returning significant capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividend.
The in the first quarter, global LNG supply showed positive year-on-year growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2020, but net growth was modest as a healthy 17% growth in U.S. exports was largely offset by declines at several LNG facilities around the globe, which were either shut down or underperforming, including facilities in Norway, Nigeria, Australia, Trindad, Tobago and Russia.
Extreme cold weather in Asia and then Europe during the first quarter, combined with the supply constraints and a tight shipping market, caused unprecedented price spikes in JKM in the early part of the quarter to all-time highs of over $30 in January.
However, price levels are still well above where they were a year ago with March JKM settling at $8.26 and June trading above $9 currently.
Well above prices around the $2 in MMBtu level a year ago, indicating an underlying structural tightening of the market, supported by strengthening demand fundamentals.
As I just mentioned, in Asia, LNG imports were very strong in Q1, up over seven million tons or 11% year-on-year.
Early reports of total gas demand in China show an increase of approximately 15% year-on-year in Q1.
Weather, continued coal-to-gas switching and a remarkable over 18% increase in Q1 GDP drove the demand increase.
In the Japan, Korea, Taiwan area, LNG imports increased 8% or three million tons year-on-year due partly to scheduled nuclear and coal outages.
From a structural demand level, 10 years after the Fukushima earthquake, most Japanese nuclear plants remain offline with only nine units, totaling 9.1 gigawatts resuming operation as of Q1 '21 compared with 42 gigawatts in 2010, solidifying LNG as a critical fuel for the stability of the energy system in Japan and in the region as a whole.
In Europe, gas demand in major markets rose by 9% year-on-year during Q1 and stronger heating and gas-fired power demand.
Significant drawdowns from storage through winter and into April has left European storage approximately 34 bcm or around 50% lower than the prior year by the end of April and approximately 11 bcm or approximately 375 Bcf below the five year average.
April TTF settled higher than JKM at $6.46 an MMBtu that was 13% higher on the month and up almost 200% year-on-year.
Current prop margins are in the $3 range, inclusive of a dramatic upward shift in charter rates from the $30,000 a day range well above the $80,000 a day range today.
The team has secured an additional approximately 1.7 million tons, locking in over $200 million in fixed fees across 2022 and '23.
Of the roughly 3,000 gigawatts of forecast incremental power generation capacity in Asia by 2040, over 300 gigawatts is expected to be gas fired.
Data from Wood Mackenzie suggest that the region could lose more than 20 Bcf a day of domestic output by 2040, and while current upstream developments are considered unlikely to offset more than just a small fraction of that decline.
In addition, gas demand in the region is currently expected to grow by at least 18 Bcf a day during the period to 2040, creating a gap of more than 35 Bcf a day of gas, which we expect to be satisfied in large part by LNG.
Again, for reference, 35 Bcf a day is equivalent to approximately 250 million tons per annum of LNG.
LNG demand growth in South and Southeast Asia is expected to accelerate and potentially grow fivefold by 2040, adding between 160 million and 200 million tons to global trade.
We believe that over the next two decades, over 20% of the growth in Asian demand will come from China, and approximately 70% will come from South and Southeast Asia as these countries prioritize gas over coal to secure economic growth and meet their climate goals.
This region consumed over 17% of global coal and was responsible for more than 1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019.
For the first quarter, we generated net income of $393 million, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $750 million.
The impact of shifts in these curves on the fair value of our commodity and FX derivatives, during first quarter 2021 was a net loss of approximately $120 million, which was substantially all noncash.
For the first quarter, we recognized an income 456 TBtu of physical LNG, including 442 TBtu from our projects and 14 TBtu from third parties.
84% of these LNG volumes recognized in income were sold under long-term SPA or IPM agreements.
However, we previously recognized $38 million of revenues during fourth quarter 2020 and related to canceled cargoes that would have been lifted in the first quarter.
Commission activities for Corpus Train three went well, as Jack discussed, and we received $191 million related to sales of commissioning cargoes in the first quarter, corresponding to 25 TBtu of LNG.
We prioritized debt reduction since raising the Cheniere loan to refinance convertible notes last year and have committed to pay down at least another $500 million of outstanding debt in 2021.
The we made good progress toward that goal during the first quarter when we paid down $148 million in outstanding borrowings under the Cheniere term loan.
In February, we locked in an approximately $150 million private placement of long-term amortizing fixed rate notes at SBL that are committed to fund in late 2021.
And at a rate of 2.95%, the lowest yielding bond ever secured across the Cheniere complex.
In March, CQP opportunistically issued $1.5 billion of 4% senior notes through 2031, the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand, were used to extend the maturity and accretively refinance all of CQP's 5.25% senior notes due 2025.
In addition, S&P's commentary indicated a leverage level of 4.5 to five times on a debt-to-EBITDA basis in the next couple of years could be consistent with an investment-grade rating.
As Jack mentioned, today, we are again increasing our guidance ranges for full year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow by $200 million, bringing total increases to $400 million above the original ranges we provided in November of last year.
Our revised guidance ranges are $4.30 to $4.6 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and $1.6 to $1.9 billion in distributable cash flow.
We currently forecast that a $1 change in market margin would impact EBITDA by approximately for full year 2021.
We expect to generate meaningful free cash flow this year for the first time in Cheniere's history of well over $1 billion.
We originally committed to $500 million in debt reduction this year, but we now think $500 million is conservative due to our strong performance and cash flow generation year-to-date and the forward sales of LNG we have executed in a strong LNG market.
Including more comprehensive plans for the remainder of free cash flow this year after meeting our initial 2021 debt reduction goal of $500 million.
