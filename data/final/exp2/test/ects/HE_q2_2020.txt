This strong foundation, coupled with other factors that benefited earnings, enabled us to deliver solid financial results for the second quarter, $0.45 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the same period last year, while achieving important progress on our long-term goals.
We're seeing the effects of reopening of our local economy and unprecedented federal stimulus, which is estimated to have delivered approximately $7.7 billion in funding to our state thus far.
Hawaii's unemployment rate improved to 13.9% in June after peaking at 23.8% in April.
At our utility, while sales were 11.6% below the same quarter last year, we've seen sales improve in some areas such as shopping centers and retail since opening of our local economy began.
Recognizing Hawaii's prudent management of COVID-19, Japan announced Hawaii's addition to a list of 12 global destinations deemed safe for Japan residents to resume travel.

A customer using 500-kilowatt hours of electricity in July paid 14% less for that energy than in March.
And as of June 30, we recorded $7.2 million in a regulatory liability account related to ERP benefits, amounts that are to be returned to customers as a reduction in O&M expenses included in rates.
In response to the audit and as part of the settlement, we committed to ramp up to $25 million in annual savings by year-end 2022 to be delivered to customers beginning by 2023.
To offset the lack of a base rate increase and achieve our $25 million by year-end 2022 commitment, we're developing and have begun implementing plans to reduce costs, including through overtime reductions, better scheduling and coordination, managed reductions of our workforce and reducing lower priority work.
We continue to aggressively advance efforts to help move our state toward 100% renewable energy and carbon neutrality.
We're excited to have 14 projects, all solar plus storage or storage only, from the original 16 selected moving forward through the contract negotiation and community engagement phase.
If all are completed, they could add about 450 megawatts of solar and about three gigawatt hours of storage to our system.
We're gathering information on parcels as small as one acre and rooftops of at least 3,200 square feet for future grid-scale solar and wind projects and community solar projects.
And just this week, Hawaiian Electric announced its commitment to convert its entire fleet of light-duty vehicles across the islands, nearly 400 sedans, SUVs, small vans and light trucks to be electric by 2035, leading the state of Hawaii in electric vehicle fleets.
Our team worked aggressively to secure and deploy PPP funding, delivering $370 million in loans for approximately 4,100 small businesses that represent roughly 40,000 jobs in our state.
At the bank, we have a front-row seat to the effects of federal stimulus with federal stimulus checks, leading to significant deposit growth, 24% on an annualized basis.
Consolidated earnings per share were $0.45 versus $0.39 in the same quarter last year.
Consolidated 12-month ROE remains healthy at 9.4%.
Utility ROE increased 10 basis points versus the same time last year to 7.9%.
Bank ROE, which we look at on an annualized rather than a trailing 12-month basis, was 8% for the quarter, down from last year due to economic impacts of COVID-19.
Utility earnings were $42.3 million compared to $32.6 million in the same quarter last year, reflecting, in part, savings due to process improvements and targeted cost reductions.
The most significant drivers of the variance were $7 million lower operations and maintenance expenses, primarily due to fewer generating unit overhauls, less generating station maintenance work associated with overhauls, the reclassification of COVID-19-related bad debt expense from the first quarter of 2020 to a regulatory asset as a result of the PUC approval to defer these expenses and lower labor costs due to lower staffing levels and reduced over time.
The lower generation overhauls and station maintenance work represented approximately $4 million of the $7 million O&M variance and are largely timing related as some of that work will be performed later this year or next year.
Earnings also reflected a $5 million revenue increase from $4 million higher RAM revenues and $1 million for recovery of West Loch project and grid modernization projects under the MPIR mechanism.
$1 million higher net income due to an unfavorable adjustment in 2019 related to reliability performance incentives and $1 million lower interest expense due to debt refinancings at lower rates.
These items were slightly offset by the following after tax items: $1 million lower allowance for funds used during construction as we were as there were fewer long-duration projects in construction work in progress; $1 million higher cost savings from ERP system implementation to be returned to customers; and $1 million higher depreciation due to increasing investments to integrate more renewable energy, improve customer reliability and strengthen system efficiency.
Turning to the drivers of the utility's financial performance for the remainder of the year, the Public Utility Commission issued its final decision for our Hawaii Island Utility, confirming Hawaii Electric's 9.5% allowed ROE and 58% equity capitalization with no change to base rates.
Separately, if the PUC approves our settlement with the consumer advocate in the Hawaiian Electric rate case for Oahu, we should see a similar outcome, no increase in base rates with 9.5% allowed ROE and 58% equity capitalization.
In the second quarter, we reclassified a pre-tax amount of $2.5 million in bad debt expense and incurred in the first quarter to a regulatory asset.
COVID related costs have been $6.5 million to date.
Although sales were down 11.6% versus the second quarter of last year, due to decoupling revenues, we were not significantly impacted.
Steel prices were down close to 30% in the quarter, and the average customer bill declined by over $20 per month monthly since the pandemic began.
On Slide 10, we continue to forecast approximately $360 million of CapEx during 2020.
Last quarter, you may recall, we indicated the potential for up to $30 million below the forecast given potential COVID impacts.
After a full quarter in the COVID environment, we have confidence in achieving the $360 million we forecast for the year.
In 2021 to 2022 period, we still expect CapEx to average approximately $400 million per year or about 2 times depreciation.
American's net income was $14 million, down from $15.8 million in the prior quarter and $17 million in the same quarter last year.
Net interest income was $56.7 million compared to $61.1 million in the linked quarter and $61.5 million in the second quarter of 2019.
ASB took an additional $7 million in credit reserves related to COVID as well as an additional $4 million for unfunded commitments.
We realized $7.1 million gain related to the sale of Visa Class B restricted shares and $2.2 million gain on the sale of investment securities as we sold some legacy positions to reduce credit risk and yield volatility in our investment portfolio.
American incurred $3.7 million in COVID-related expenses, consisting of additional pay to frontline employees, the payout of excess vacation days for employees unable to use vacation while working through the pandemic, purchases of PPE and sanitation supplies and employee meals purchased to promote employee safety and support small business restaurants.
On Slide 12, ASB's net interest margin declined to 3.21% this quarter from 3.72% in the first quarter.
The lower interest rate environment was the largest driver of the net interest margin compression, comprising 34 basis points of the decline.
FAS 91 amortization was also a large factor, reflecting a faster rate of prepayments due to lower rates at the long end of the curve.
This accounted for 15 basis points of compression.
In the second quarter, NIM compression compressed quickly as variable rate loans repriced after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate to near 0 in March.
Approximately 93% of our variable rate portfolio have now repriced and indices to which those variable rates are tied are at or near their floors.
For mortgage-backed securities, which comprise 90% of this portfolio, the amortization increases if prepayments accelerate.
Given these factors, we now expect net interest margin to be in the 3.35% to 3.25% range for the year.
The total provision recognized during the quarter was $15.1 million as reflected in our on our income statement, which also included $4.3 million allowance related to unfunded commitments.
Overall, we have a high-quality loan book that remains healthy with only 3% of our borrowers requesting or qualifying for additional deferral thus far.
Our residential book comprises approximately 60% of the loan portfolio, and the loan-to-value of that portfolio remains conservative at 52%.
Only a small portion of that portfolio, roughly 8%, have requested payment relief.
In consumer loans, which make up just over 4% of the overall portfolio, we've seen a high-volume of deferment request but at low balances.
The bank has strong liquidity with over $3 billion available from a combination of FHLB and unencumbered securities.
ASB's Tier one leverage ratio of 8.4% was comfortably above well-capitalized levels at the end of the second quarter.
As of June 30, we had $425 million of undrawn credit facility capacity, consisting of $150 million at the holding company and $275 million at the utility with just $16.5 million in commercial paper outstanding, all at the holding company.
The utility paid off $14 million in long-term debt when it matured in July with no other long-term debt maturities until 2022.
As of June 30, it had $65 million in unrestricted cash balances.
In 2021, the utility has $50 million in short-term bank loan maturity and expects to access the debt capital markets to help fund its capital investment program.
At the holding company, we have $50 million long-term debt and $65 million short-term bank term loan maturing in the first half of 2021, and we are currently planning refinancing options for those maturities.
On Tuesday, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share at an annualized rate of $1.32 per share.
At the bank, we are continuing to provide pre-tax pre-provision income guidance, which includes net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense to range from $90 million to $110 million.
Given the current low interest rate environment and excess liquidity, we expect interest margin in the 3.25% to 3.35% range.
Our holding company guidance is unchanged at $0.27 to $0.29 loss.
