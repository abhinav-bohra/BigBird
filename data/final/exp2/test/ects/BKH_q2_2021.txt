Our team delivered strong financial results, with earnings up 21% compared to last year.
Were on track to deploy up to $647 million of capital for the year, and we continue to evaluate and develop new opportunities beyond 2021.
We are targeting 5% to 7% earnings growth for 2023 through 2025 and at least 5% annual dividend growth.
We continue to plan for capital investments of more than $3 billion through 2025.
Our preferred plan proposes to add 100 megawatts of new renewable generation, evaluate the addition of up to 20 megawatts of battery storage to help maintain reliability, and evaluate and develop new transmission opportunities.
Were taking a responsible approach to reducing our emissions, with goals to reduce emissions intensity for our electric operations of 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2040 off a 2005 baseline.
For our gas utilities, were targeting a 50% reduction by 2035 and have voluntarily committed to reducing methane emissions with our participation in the EPA Methane Challenge and the One Future Coalition.
We delivered earnings per share as adjusted of $0.40 compared to $0.33 in Q2 2020, a 21% increase.
The net benefit to earnings from weather was $0.01 per share compared to normal and $0.01 below the second quarter last year.
As I noted on the previous slide, the main drivers compared to last year were $9.2 million of gross margin improvement from new rates and riders and recovery of wholesale power margins at our utilities.
The additional quarter-over-quarter tax benefits of $4.3 million on the far right of the slide were primarily from two items: first, Nebraska Tax Cuts and Jobs Act customer bill credits, which reduced gross margins collected from customers and reduced income tax expense by the same amount; and second, increased flow-through tax benefits related to repairs and certain indirect costs.
The first quarter net impact from Storm Uri was $12.5 million, or $0.15 per share.
As we told you then, we planned to offset approximately $0.05 of these costs through regulatory actions and ongoing power marketing opportunities.
We delivered $0.03 of the offsets in the second quarter, and we anticipate achieving the other $0.02 through the remainder of the year.
And we are on plan to mitigate the remaining $0.10 net storm year impact through O&M management and other opportunities.
At the end of June, we had more than $500 million of available liquidity on our revolving credit facility.
We expect to finalize our refinancing strategy for the $600 million balance on our term loan in the third quarter.
The weighted average length of recovery requested in our regulatory plans is 3.7 years.
New debt and deferred recovery of fuel costs for Storm Uri temporarily increased our debt to total capitalization ratio to 62% at the end of March, and it remained at that level at the end of June.
During the second quarter, we issued $40 million through our at-the-market equity offering program.
Our equity issuance expectations are still $100 million to $120 million for 2021 and $60 million to $80 million for 2022.
In 2020, we proudly marked 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases, one of the longest track records in our industry.
Since 2016, weve increased our dividend at an average annual rate of 6.6%.
And looking forward, we anticipate increasing our dividend by more than 5% annually through 2025 while maintaining our 50% to 60% payout target.
