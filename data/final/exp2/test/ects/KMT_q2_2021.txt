Sales this quarter increased sequentially by 10%, outpacing the 1% to 2% increase from Q1 to Q2 that we typically see.
As a reminder, those two end-markets totaled more than 65% of our sales.
On a year-over-year basis, organic sales declined 14% on top of a 12% decline in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 160 basis points to 13% versus 11.4% in the prior year quarter.
Operating expense as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year to 22% due to lower sales, however, in dollar terms, decreased 9%.
Our target for operating expense remains at 20%.
Adjusted earnings per share of $0.16 was essentially flat versus $0.17 in the prior year quarter, reflecting the factors I just mentioned.
We expect the underlying organic growth, excluding the effect of FX, to be in the mid-single digits, which is modestly above our typical sequential growth pattern of 3% to 4%.
On the operational excellence side, simplification/modernization initiatives delivered $23 million this quarter, a 117% year-over-year increase and are on track to deliver approximately $80 million in benefits this year as expected.
Total cumulative savings from inception of the program are expected to be $180 million by the end of this fiscal year, which is within the original target range we laid out in December 2017 and will be achieved despite much lower volume levels than originally planned.
Total capex is expected to be between $110 million and $130 million this year, a 50% reduction year-over-year.
Free operating cash flow was $29 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure to approximately breakeven.
This approach opens up a 40% increase in served market opportunity while offering better service in tooling options for our customers.
As a reminder, the last time the Company experienced a sales decline close of the one we are currently experiencing was during The Great Recession in 2009.
Graph show trailing 12 month sales on the left and the corresponding adjusted operating margin on the right.
And in this quarter, the 12 month profitability level is approximately the same, but on a much lower revenue.
We are anticipating an additional approximately $40 million in savings by the end of this fiscal year.
On a year-over-year basis, total sales declined 13% and 14% organically.
Foreign currency and business days each contribute approximately 1% and a business divestiture had a negative effect of 1% in the quarter.
Adjusted gross profit margin of 28.2% was up 140 basis points year-over-year.
Adjusted operating expenses of $98 million were down $10 million or 9% year-over-year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13% was up 160 basis points from the previous year quarter.
Sequentially, despite rolling back many temporary cost control actions in the quarter, which should amounted to close to $10 million, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 170 basis points due to the improving market conditions and continued simplification/modernization savings.
Adjusted operating margin of 5.3% was up 50 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially.
The improved year-over-year performance in our margin was primarily due to the positive effect of raw materials as expected, which contributed approximately 590 basis points, incremental simplification/modernization benefits, and temporary cost control actions, partially offset by lower volumes and associated under-absorption.
The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter of 24.7% was lower year-over-year due to the effects of higher pre-tax income and geographical mix.
Our current expectation is for the adjusted effective tax rate for the fiscal year to be approximately 30%.
Longer-term, we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low 20% range as profitability levels increase beyond fiscal year '21.
We reported a GAAP earnings per share of $0.23 versus an earnings per share loss of $0.07 in the prior year period.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.16 per share versus $0.17 in the prior year.
Effective operations this quarter amounted to negative $0.20.
This compares positively to both the negative $0.62 in the prior year quarter and the negative $0.28 last quarter.
The largest factor contributing to the $0.20 was the effect of lower volumes and associated under-absorption, partially offset by positive raw materials of $0.25 and temporary cost control actions.
The negative effect of operations this quarter was basically offset by $0.19 or $23 million of benefits from simplification/modernization, a significant increase from $0.10 in the prior year quarter.
This brings the cumulative benefits of simplification/modernization to $145 million since inception.
As Chris mentioned, our expectation continues to be that simplification/modernization benefits for the total year will be approximately $80 million, driven by actions already taken or announced, bringing the total expected cumulative savings to $180 million by the end of fiscal year 2021.
Slide 6 and 7 detail the performance of our segments in this quarter.
Metal Cutting sales in the quarter declined 14% organically on top of a 10% decline in the prior year period.
All regions posted year-over-year sales decreases with the largest decline in the Americas at negative 20%, followed by EMEA at 12%, and Asia-Pacific at 6%.
From an end-market perspective, we experienced the best performance in Transportation and General Engineering, which declined 4% and 12%, respectively.
Energy declined 18% year-over-year with the declines in the oil and gas portion of the Energy end-market more than offsetting continued strength in renewable energy, mainly in Asia Pacific.
Aerospace continues to be our most challenged end-market with sales down 43% in Q2 as COVID-19 continues to affect production levels and air travel.
Adjusted operating margin of 6.1% was down 280 basis points year-over-year, but well above the 1% we experienced in the first quarter.
Year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decline in volume and mix, partially offset by incremental simplification/modernization benefits, temporary cost control actions, and raw materials that contributed 230 basis points.
Organic sales declined 14% on top of a 14% decline in the prior year period.
Other factors affecting Infrastructure sales were divestiture of 1%, partially offset by a benefit from business days of 1% and FX of 1%.
Regionally, again, the largest decline was in the Americas at 18%, then EMEA at 12%, followed by 1% growth in Asia Pacific.
By end-market, the results were primarily driven by Energy, which declined 24% year-over-year, due mainly to the roughly 60% decline in the US land only rig count.
Earthworks was down 10% year-over-year driven by underground mining and construction weakness in the US.
General Engineering was down 7% year-over-year, an improvement from the 14% decline we experienced in Q1.
Adjusted operating margin of 4.4% was up 620 basis points year-over-year.
This increase was mainly driven by favorable raw materials, which contributed 1,230 basis points as expected, simplification/modernization benefits, and temporary cost control actions, partially offset by lower volumes and associated under-absorption.
Our current debt profile is made up of two $300 million notes, maturing in February of 2022 and June of 2028, as well as the US $700 million revolver that matures in June of 2023.
At quarter end, we had $25 million outstanding on the revolver with combined cash and revolver availability of approximately $780 million and we were well within our financial covenants.
Primary working capital decreased year-over-year to $638 million, given our continued focus on inventory.
On a percentage of sales basis, primary working capital increased to 37.3% as sales remained depressed.
Our target primary working capital to sales ratio remains 30%.
Capital expenditures were $29 million, a decrease of $46 million from the prior year as expected, as our capital spending on simplification/modernization is substantially complete.
Year-to-date, we have spent $69 million and continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million.
Free operating cash flow for the quarter improved year-over-year to $29 million.
Year-to-date, our free operating cash flow is approximately breakeven and $59 million more favorable compared to last year.
Consistent with prior quarters, we paid the dividend of $17 million.
Starting with simplification/modernization, as we already mentioned, we expect to achieve benefits of approximately $80 million in FY '21, which implies around $40 million of incremental year-over-year savings in the second half.
Temporary cost control actions, unlike in the first half, will be a significant year-over-year headwind of $50 million to $55 million, with $40 million to $45 million in the fourth quarter.
Given the phase out of cost control actions in the second quarter, Q3 will face a sequential headwind of approximately $10 million relative to Q2.
Although depreciation and amortization were only modestly higher year-over-year in the first half, we still expect them to be approximately $10 million higher for the full year as new equipment comes online.
Lastly, for the earnings per share drivers, we have lowered our adjusted effective tax rate expectations for fiscal year '21 to approximately 30% from our previous estimate of 33%, which was also the effective tax rate last year.
In terms of free operating cash flow drivers, as Chris and I already mentioned, capital spending for the year is expected to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million.
And we now expect the full year cash restructuring to be higher by $20 million to $25 million versus the approximate $40 million spent in FY '20.
We expect the underlying organic growth, excluding the effect of FX, to be in this mid-single digits and above our typical sequential growth pattern of 3% to 4%.
