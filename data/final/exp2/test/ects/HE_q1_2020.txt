As of May 4 we have had sadly 17 deaths and a total case load of 621 but also 16 days where new cases were in the single digits.
Post 9/11 and post the Great Recession tourism came back strongly.
And they believe that local economic activity will return by 35% to 45% in May and June and 75% by year-end.
And we remain committed to our state's 100% renewable portfolio standard and carbon neutrality goals.
For example on Oahu in May lower fuel costs would reduce a 500-kilowatt hour per month bill by more than $12 compared to March.
We're proud that Americans secured over $370 million for approximately 3600 small businesses employing roughly 40000 individuals.
And that Hawaii banks in total obtained funding for 78% of our states eligible payrolls in the first round placing Hawaii in the top five states in the nation.
Our utility has delivered power for our state for over 125 years through many different economic and social conditions.
And indeed in the last week of March we saw lower loads 7% lower on Oahu and Hawaii Island and 14% lower on Maui.
The lower loads also impact our renewable portfolio standard or RPS performance albeit in a positive fashion since the lower kilowatt hour sales reduces the denominator in the RPS calculation and we expect to comfortably exceed our 2020 RPS goal of 30%.
Our bank has served our state for 95 years and has a conservative risk culture lending practices and loan portfolio.
These attributes helped ASB perform well compared to other banks during the 2008 2009 financial crisis and position it well for the challenge at hand.
We have paid uninterrupted dividends since [1901 including during the Great Recession and maintaining the stability of our dividend is no less important today.
I was CEO of HEI through 9/11 and the Great Recession.
On slide nine our Q1 earnings were $0.31 per share compared to $0.42 per share in the prior-year quarter.
COVID-19 expense impacted earnings at both the utility and the bank including $2.5 million higher utility bad debt expense pre-tax than Q1 of last year and additional provisioning for COVID-19 of over $4 million at the bank.
Loads were strong and showed increases over the prior year of nearly 5%.
On slide 10 utility earnings were $23.9 million compared to $32.1 million in the first quarter of 2019.
The most significant drivers of the variance were: $3 million revenue increase from higher rate adjustment mechanism revenues $1 million revenue increase from the recovery of West Loch and Grid Modernization projects under the major project interim recovery mechanism; and $1 million lower interest expense due to debt refinancings at lower rates.
These items were offset by $7 million higher O&M expenses compared to Q1 2019 primarily due to increased bad debt expense due to COVID-19 the absence of onetime of a onetime benefit in Q1 2019 due to deferral treatment for certain previously incurred expenses and an increase in vegetation management work and higher outside service costs.
In addition we had approximately $1 million higher depreciation expense $1 million lower net income from the absence of renewable procurement performance incentive mechanism.
And we received that we received in 1Q 2019 $1 million from the absence of mutual assistant work reimbursement from the first quarter of 2019 and $1 million lower AFUDC as there were fewer long duration projects in construction work in progress particularly after the West Loch was placed in service in November.
American's net income was $15.8 million in the quarter down from $28.2 million in the previous quarter.
Although as a reminder 4Q the fourth quarter of 2019 included $7.7 million of net income from the sales of the former of former properties.
Net income was also down by $5 million versus the first quarter of 2019 mostly due to the provision taken due to COVID-19.
Following our adoption of CECL and the additional provision in the first quarter relating to COVID we believe we are well positioned and our allowance for loan and lease losses ratio of 149 basis points is above our local peers who average about 126 basis points.
We also saw a strong loan growth during the quarter of 4.7% annualized with solid loan growth in commercial and commercial real estate portfolios as well as strong deposit growth of 7.1% on an annualized basis.
HEI issued $65 million a $65 million 364-day term loan freeing up the full capacity of our $150 million credit facility.
Hawaiian Electric added $75 million of capacity through a new revolver and launched and repriced and priced $160 million private placement $95 million of which was used to free up credit capacity on its revolver.
The private placement also included a $50 million green bond portion.
Looking at maturities over the our long-term debt maturities over the remainder of 2020 only $14 million remains at the utility.
We have a modest holding company maturity of $50 million in the first quarter of 2021 which we expect to refinance in advance of that maturity.
The bank has strong liquidity with approximately $3 billion available from the combination of the FHLB and unencumbered securities.
We remain committed to investment-grade rating and can turn on our dividend reinvestment program if needed which can cost effectively generate about $30 million of cash and incremental equity annually based on historical levels.
We're currently forecasting approximately $22 million of COVID-19 related expenses at the utility.
We had originally requested 4% revenue increase or about $78 million.
We are now approximately we now forecast approximately $330 million to $360 million of Capex in 2020.
As we see about $30 million of potential downside due to COVID related delays.
In the 2021 through 2022 period we expect Capex to average approximately $400 million per year or about 2x depreciation.
Our bank guidance for the year of $0.73 to $0.80 is shown on the left on the left lower left.
We estimate the pre-tax provision income range to be from $90 million to $110 million for 2020.
Given our already very low-cost of funds at 24 basis points in the first quarter there is little room to move lower and improve to improve net interest margins.
If you look at the 2008 through 2011 period our provision expense averaged 0.52% of our loan portfolio and peaked at 0.81%.
If you apply that to a portfolio of our size today you'd have approximately you'd have an average credit cost of $27 million and a peak of $42 million.
We expect pre-tax pre-provision income which includes net interest income noninterest income and noninterest expense to range from $90 million to $110 million.
Given our current low interest rate environment we expect net interest margin in the 3.45% to 3.55% range.
Our holding company guidance is unchanged at $0.27 to $0.29 earnings per share loss.
