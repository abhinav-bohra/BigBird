Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.05.
EPS improve to $0.35 per share when you factor in the net positive impacts from settling our recent labor strike, including the benefits from our new collective bargaining agreement, and the lingering strike-related costs as well as the gain from the Flowform Products divestiture.
We sold our Flowform business for $55 million, resulting in a gain on sale of nearly $14 million.
At the same time, we added new notes due in 2029 and 2031.
As a result of these third quarter actions, annual interest expense will decrease by about $6 million and pension funding levels improve.
In July, we reached agreement with Specialty Rolled Products union representative employees, ending their 3.5-month strike.
Our Q3 results included initial LEAP-1B volume increases to support the expected 737 MAX production ramp.
We expect this market to continue at low levels in Q4 and into 2022 as international travel rates recover more slowly and 787 deliveries remain on hold.
Overall, Q3 revenue increased to $726 million, up 18% sequentially and 21% year-over-year.
Q3-adjusted EBITDA grew to $80 million, up 49% sequentially and up 381% year-over-year.
Q3 performance suggests a revenue run rate approaching $3 billion and an adjusted EBITDA run rate of $320 million.
On a reported basis, ATI earned $0.35 per share in the third quarter.
We earned $0.05 per share in the quarter after adjusting for a net $43 million of special items.

Revenue increased $49 million, and EBITDA increased $46 million.
Late in the third quarter, we issued two debt tranches totaling $675 million.
$325 million of the notes are due in 2029 and bear interest at 4.875%.
$350 million of the notes are due in 2031 and bear interest at 5.125%.
Proceeds from these notes were largely used to redeem $500 million of notes due in 2023, bearing a 7.875% interest rate.
The financing brings several benefits, including $6 million in annual cash interest savings, significantly lower interest rates and a much improved debt maturity schedule.
Excess proceeds from the financing were largely used to support a $50 million voluntary pension contribution in the quarter.
After redeeming the 2023 notes in mid-October, we had more than $800 million of liquidity, including approximately $440 million of cash on hand.
We expect significant reductions in managed working capital levels, well below 40% of revenue across the company in Q4.
Our $50 million voluntary contribution is the latest action in our plan to improve pension funding levels and reduce related expenses and contributions over time.
This lowers overall participation by nearly 1,000 people and shifts approximately $70 million of assets and liabilities to a third party.
Additionally, we expect to recognize a $7 million benefit in the fourth quarter from a retroactive 2021 tax credit in China.
We expect to report adjusted earnings between $0.07 and $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter, despite the SRP strategic outage costs.
