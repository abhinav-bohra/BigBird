While the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were expansive, our business stood up to these challenges and we are in $799 million after-tax for the fourth quarter and over $1.1 billion for the full year.
While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter.
While other issuers faced significant challenges with long hold times, there was no disruption to our outstanding service as we leveraged our digital capabilities and our 100% U.S.-based customer service.
We also took quick action at the onset of the pandemic to mitigate credit risk by tightening new account underwriting criteria, reducing promotional rate offers and pulling back on credit line increases, and we added $2.4 billion to reserves as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated.
As expected, the tightening of our underwriting criteria combined with elevated payment rates impacted our loan growth and our total loans decreased 6% year-over-year.
Our digital bank operating model combined with disciplined expense management has historically generated industry-leading efficiency, but in 2020, we took additional action to control costs and delivered on our commitment to cut $400 million from planned expenses despite absorbing several one-time items that have occurred during the year.
Excluding the one-time items, expenses were down nearly 2% year-over-year.
Our PULSE debit business had a strong year with volume up 10% from 2019, reflecting the impact of stimulus funds and higher transaction sizes as debit became a critical way of procuring goods during the pandemic.
Our Discover proprietary network was down 2% for the year and exited the fourth quarter at plus 5%, in line with card sales volume.
Earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.1 billion share repurchase plan and we may begin buybacks as soon as the first quarter, subject to the Federal Reserve's limitations.
We earned $799 million in net income or $2.59 per share.
These results included several one-time expenses, totaling $137 million.
Excluding these, earnings per share would have been $2.94.
In the fourth quarter, net interest income was down 2%, reflecting a 5% decline in average receivables and lower loan yield.
Non-interest income was 14% lower, driven by higher rewards costs from strong engagement in the 5% category this quarter, a one-time write-off of certain real estate facilities and lower loan fee income also contributed to the year-over-year decrease.
The provision for credit losses was $305 million lower than the prior year due to meaningful improvement in credit performance.
There was no change to reserve levels in the current quarter, whereas the prior year included an $85 million reserve build.
Operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year driven by one-time items related to software write-offs, charges for penalties and restitution, and costs of a voluntary early retirement program.
Excluding one-time items, expenses were down 4% from the prior year.
Total loans were down 6% from the prior year driven by a 7% decrease in card receivables.
In student loans, we had a strong peak origination season, increasing market share in leading to 7% loan growth.
Personal loans were down 7% as a result of actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize potential credit losses.
Net interest margin continued to improve, up 34 basis points from the prior year and 44 basis points from the prior quarter to 10.63%.
We cut our online savings rate another 10 basis points from the third quarter as we continue to actively manage funding costs lower.
Online savings rates, 12 month and 24-month CDs are all down to 50 basis points.
Average consumer deposits increased 18% from the prior year.
We continue to see steady demand for our consumer deposit products, which were up $1 billion from the prior quarter.
And our goal remains to have 70% to 80% of our funding from deposits.
As Roger noted, we delivered on our commitment to reduce planned expenses by at least $400 million during the year, and I'm pleased to say that we accomplished this goal despite several one-time expense items that occurred in 2020.
Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased $94 million or 8% from the prior year, driven completely by $137 million in one-time expense items.
Excluding these, operating expenses would have been down $43 million or 4% year-over-year.
Employee compensation was up $57 million or 13%, driven by a one-time item related to a voluntary early retirement program as well as staffing increases in technology and higher average salaries and benefits.
Marketing and business development expense was down $75 million or 32%.
Professional fees decreased $22 million or 10%, mainly driven by lower third-party recovery fees related to courts operating at limited capacity.
Once again, credit performance was very strong and total charge-offs below 2.4% and credit card net charge-offs nearly 2.6%.
The card net charge-off rate was 78 basis points lower than the prior year, while the net charge-off dollars were down $180 million or 28%.
Compared to the third quarter, net card charge-off rate declined 82 basis points.
The 30-plus delinquency rate was 55 basis points lower than last year and increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter.
Credit also remained strong in our private student loan portfolio with net charge-offs down 31 basis points year-over-year.
Excluding purchased loans, the 30-plus delinquency rate improved 40 basis points from the prior year and 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter.
In our personal loan portfolio, net charge-offs were down 147 basis points and the 30-plus delinquency rate was down 29 basis points year-over-year.
The primary assumptions in our economic model were a year-end 2021 unemployment rate of about 8% and GDP growth of about 2.7%.
Our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio increased 90 basis points sequentially to 13.1%, remaining above our 10.5% internal target and well above regulatory minimums.
We have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at $0.44 per share.
Regarding share repurchases, as Roger indicated, earlier this week, we received authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $1.1 billion of common stock.
