We have now over 30% growth in our customer base, reaching 675,000 customers.
Our clients' adoption of digital channels continued to improve during 2020, reaching an increase of over 33% in logins and digital transaction increasing over 55% for the year.
For the year, we generated $102 million in net income, $0.46 per share, shy to the $167 million that we generated in 2019, definitely impacted by the economic effects on the pandemic and the increased provision driven by CECL and the acquisition.
Pre-tax preparation was strong, increasing 6% to $300 million, with actually only four months of our combined company.
Loan origination and renewal for the year reached $4.4 billion, and organic core deposit growth, a record growth of $2 billion.
This compares to $28 million in the past quarter.
PPNR came in very strong with $86 million, up from $77 million in the prior quarter.
And then, when we look at capital, CET1 17.3%, definitely post acquisition impact still very strong and among the highest.
As I say, loan origination activity was robust for the quarter, $1.4 billion.
So, if we exclude Main Street and PPP, origination still increased by $278 million to $1.2 billion, so still strong.
The overall portfolio, now it's at $11.8 billion, declined slightly from prior quarter.
And also we received repayments of about $49 million on the PPP loan forgiveness process.
For this quarter, we anticipate another approximately $100 million of repayment in PPP.
And we are now, obviously as you know, working in Round 2 of PPP, which was recently approved.
Our initial estimates are around $250 million in loans during the first half of 2021 on PPP loans.
And when we look at the quarter, core deposits were up another $257 million.
I think it's important to highlight that the earnings power of our franchise now reach a new high with $86 million of PPNR on the combined operation, again being only the first quarter of this.
We are targeting a long-term efficiency ratio of 55% following the completion of the integration.
So we have -- we continued to see excess cash, reserve coverage remain at the similar levels of prior quarter, so very strong reserve coverage at 3.3%.
And then, capital is again very strong with CET1 at above [Phonetic] 17%, after completing the acquisition.
Last night, we announced the approval to increase the dividend this quarter to $0.07 per share, definitely driven by current and predicted earnings.
Aurelio mentioned we had a strong quarter, $50 million in the quarter, $0.23 a share, which compares with $28 million last quarter, $0.13 a share.
The quarter included still some merger and restructuring costs of $12.3 million this quarter compared with $10.4 million last quarter.
And also keep in mind that last quarter, we had a Day 1 CECL allowance for the corporation [Phonetic] of almost $39 million and we recognized an $8 million reversal -- a partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which also reflected on the results.
Net interest income for the quarter, it's up $29 million.
A lot has to do with the $1.7 billion higher average loan balance we have in the quarter, which includes the Santander acquisition, obviously the full effect, but also new originations on the commercial and consumer loans for the quarter.
Those were partially offset by, as Aurelio made reference to also, the fact that we have continued to reduce the mortgage portfolio, which is down about $130 million [Phonetic] as compared to September 30, as well as the $49 million reduction in PPP loans.
The quarter also -- we recognized $1.1 million of interest income we collected on non-accrual loans, mostly charge-off non-accrual loans that were recovered.
And the repayment of the PPP loans resulted in the acceleration of $700,000 of commissions on those loans.
On the quarter, we also had a reduction of over [Phonetic] $800,000 in interest expense.
This is even though the overall interest bearing liabilities went up $2 billion from the full quarter effect of the transaction and continued increase on deposits.
We saw an 18 basis points reduction on the funding cost during the quarter as compared to last quarter.
Non-interest income for the quarter is $30 million.
It is up $5 million.
If we consider that last quarter had $5 million of gains on loss -- the gain on sales of securities, we didn't have much this quarter.
So excluding that -- those $5 million, non-interest income went up again $5 million.
$2.5 million was service charges on deposits, full quarter of Santander acquisition plus increases that we are starting to see on volume of transactions.
So we had $500,000 increases in those gains on sales of some of those mortgage loans.
Also during in the quarter, we recognized $1.4 million on fees on Main Street loans we originated during the quarter.
$184 million of loans were originated under the Main Street Lending Program.
And we sold the 95% participation through the government as tabulated in the program.
Expenses for the quarter were $134 million, almost $135 million, which is up from $107 million; again full quarter effect.
Those expenses again include the $12 million in merger and restructuring costs for the quarter.
So far from the start of the process, we have incurred approximately $36 million in merger and restructuring costs.
And we expect that there will be an additional somewhere between $26 million and $30 million happening mostly on the first half of 2021, as we complete integrations, conversions and a number of other things that are ongoing in the integration process.
Pandemic expenses, again, cleaning cost, additional security and things like that was -- were $1.1 million, basically similar to the $1 million we had in the third quarter.
If we exclude all these items, expenses went up $25 million, mostly again from having the full quarter of the acquired operations, but also the higher transaction volumes on debit, credit card and some other components increase cost, plus some additional items and some $900,000 in incentive compensation increases.
We had $2.3 million in technology fees.
The increased amortization of the intangibles associated with the transaction was about $1.5 million higher for the quarter.
On the other hand, if we look at credit-related expenses that were slightly down were $1.8 million compared to $2.2 million last quarter.
Allowance for credit losses at December was $401 million, slightly down from about $402.6 million we had at September.
However, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $385 million, $386 million almost, which is $1.2 million higher than September.
The ratio of the loans allowance was 3.28% as compared to 3.25% in September.
The provision for the quarter, as you saw on the release, was $7.7 million, which compares to almost $47 million in the quarter.
But again, third quarter included the $38.9 million provision, Day 1 provision we put in to comply with CECL requirements for non-PCD loans on the acquired operations.
As a result of the required provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolios went up and we booked a provision of $22.3 million in the fourth quarter and the reserve or the allowance for credit losses increased $252.7 million or 2.7% of loans from our 2.3% of loans last quarter.
In the case of residential mortgages on the other hand, the improvement on macroeconomic variables combined with the reduction in the portfolio that I mentioned, the $130 million [Phonetic] reduction, resulted in a release of credit losses of $9.8 million for the quarter.
And same thing on consumer side, the improvement on the macroeconomic variables resulted in a release of $2.3 million in reserves requirements.
If we exclude the PPP loans on a non-GAAP basis, the ratio of the allowance to loans would be 3.39%, which is still very healthy allowance coverage for possible losses at December.
It was 3.38% at September, so it stayed very consistent.
In terms of our asset quality, in non-performing, we're basically flat from last quarter, $294 million.
Non-performing loans increased $3.80 million in the quarter, $2.6 million of the increase was in residential portfolio and $1.4 million in the consumer portfolio.
On the other hand, the other real estate owned came down by $6 million, driven by sales.
We sold $5.8 million of residential real estate, all the real estate that we had on the books.
Inflows of non-performing were $32.9 million compared to $18.4 million in the third quarter.
The level of leverage resulting of 11.3%, still very healthy and well in line with what we had expected at completion of the transaction.
Net income for the year was $102 million or $0.46 a share, but it was affected by $130 million increase in provision, which includes pandemic impact and the fact that we did record the Day 1 CECL allowance of $39 million I mentioned before required for the loans -- the non-PCD loans we obtained under transaction.
Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision for the year was up 6% to $300 million from $284 million.
NPAs year over year decreased $24 million to $294 million, and we continue to work on the process of getting those numbers down.
