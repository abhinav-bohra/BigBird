We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical products with year-to-date orders in backlog up 11% and 15%, respectively.
Notably, Industrial organic orders growth was 28% in the quarter and our Industrial backlog is up 30% year-to-date, well above pre-pandemic levels.
Revenue in the quarter was up 2% organically with operating margin up 80 basis points year over year and 240 basis points sequentially.
EPS was up 39% versus last year.
More specifically, we saw approximately $10 million of revenue pushed out of Q3 due to supplier input delays, logistics constraints and ongoing labor availability challenges.
This reduced our organic growth by roughly 5 points in the quarter.
Looking forward, we expect these challenges to continue through the fourth quarter, resulting in a $15 million impact on revenue.
For the year, we expect approximately $25 million of revenue to push out of 2021.
Organic orders of $194 million in the quarter were up 15% versus prior year.
We saw a strong year-over-year increase of 28% in industrial with growth in all regions.
Orders were down 10% in aerospace and defense due to the timing of large defense orders.
Organic revenue was $191 million, up 1% versus prior year.
Revenue came in approximately $10 million lower than expected as a result of the supply chain challenges that Scott mentioned upfront.
Adjusted operating income was $19 million or 10.1%, up 80 basis points from prior year and up 240 basis points from the previous quarter.
Finally, we delivered $0.50 of adjusted earnings per share, up 39% versus prior year and generated free cash flow of $7 million.
Industrial organic orders were up 28% versus last year and down 9% sequentially.
Aftermarket orders were up 42% and our downstream aftermarket backlog is the highest it has been since 2017.
Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter and year-to-date is 1.1%, an indication of continued end market demand.
Industrial organic revenue was up 3% versus last year and up 1% sequentially.
This adversely impacted revenue by $6 million or 5 points of organic growth.
Adjusted operating margin was 8.7%, up 80 basis points versus last year and up 70 basis points versus Q2.
Improvements were driven by productivity and continued value-based pricing up 2%, partially offset by higher inflation.
aerospace and defense orders were $54 million down 10% versus last year and flat sequentially.
Revenue was $61 million, down 2% year over year and up 2% from prior quarter.
Slightly lower revenue was primarily driven by lower defense OEM shipments, partially offset by recovery in commercial aerospace, up 10% and an improvement in defense aftermarket revenue, up 7%.
Similar to Industrial, aerospace and defense was also impacted by the global supply chain and logistic constraints, which negatively impacted the quarter by $4 million or six points of growth.
Finally, operating margin was 24.2% in the quarter, up 50 basis points year over year and up 430 basis points from Q2.
Free cash flow in the quarter was $7 million, an improvement versus prior year but lower than expected.
We reduced our total debt by $23 million versus prior year and ended Q3 with $445 million of net debt.
Due to the lower earnings and cash outlook for the year, we now expect to improve our leverage by approximately 0.3 turns by the end of the year.
We expect revenue to be up 1% to 3% organically, which includes $15 million of delayed revenue out of the quarter due to continued global supply chain, logistics and labor challenges.
For Industrial, we expect orders in Q4 to be up more than 10% and revenue is expected to be up 3% to 6% with growth across most end markets.
In A&D, fourth quarter orders are expected to be up greater than 50% driven by large OEM defense programs.
Revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat to down 5%, with double-digit growth in commercial aerospace and defense aftermarket, offset by lower deliveries on defense programs.
We're expecting adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 in the fourth quarter with incremental and decremental margins of 30% to 35%.
Corporate cost is expected to increase by $1 million versus prior year.
Finally, we're planning for free cash flow of $10 million to $15 million in Q4 as we expect supply chain constraints will continue to impact our ability to complete in-process projects and collect milestone billings from customers.
Organic revenue is expected to be flat to down 2%, which reflects $25 million of revenue delayed out of the year.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.74 is lower as a result of this reduction in volume and free cash flow is expected to be $4 million to $9 million.
On revenue, we expect modest improvement year over year with growth between 3% and 6%.
Our short-cycle products are expected to be up 6% to 9% overall, primarily driven by aftermarket growth between 8% and 11%.
Finally, pricing is expected to net roughly 2% and as pricing actions that were taken in Q2 and Q3 start to roll through our top and bottom line.
A&D revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be flat to down 5% versus prior year, primarily due to supply chain constraints and the timing of shipments for large defense programs.
Defense revenue is expected to be down 10% to 15% with lower shipments on our OEM programs.
On the other hand, government orders for defense spares and MRO services picked up in the third quarter and we expect aftermarket revenue growth of 10% to 15%.
Commercial aerospace is expected to continue its recovery with 25% to 30% growth following three consecutive quarters of sequential orders growth.
Revenue from commercial air framers will be up 20% to 25% and mostly driven by the increased recovery in narrow-body aircraft production, most notably the A320.
Finally, pricing is expected to be a net benefit of 3% for defense and 4% for commercial.
We launched eight new products in Q3 and remain on track to deliver 45 new products by the end of 2021.
We're making really good progress with our 80/20 initiative.
With this structured approach, we've built a meaningful pipeline of growth and simplification opportunities and have already used 80/20 to implement strategic price increases at our U.S. site.
Even more importantly, when talking to the teams, it's apparent that 80/20 is becoming a part of our culture and how we do business.
We're the first supplier to meet the latest EU transportation regulation on the balance valve and we're able to secure more than $1 million of initial orders so far in 2021.
