We collected nearly 97% of rents in the quarter and nearly 98% in October.
In the third quarter and for the year to date, we reported AFFO per share growth of 1.5% and 4.5% respectively.
Thus far, our entrance fee communities and skilled nursing properties, which together generate over 50% of our revenue, have been quite resilient.
This includes deferring up to $3 million of November rent.
They have additional deferrals of $750,000 available for each of December and January, all of which if exercised will accrue interest at an 8% rate with repayment expected over 12 months beginning in June 2021.
We are also continuing to work with prospective lenders and Bickford on the previously disclosed sale of nine properties, which we estimate will improve Bickford's annual cash flow by approximately $3 million.
Bickford has applied for grants under Phase 2 and 3 of the Provider Relief Fund, which we expect that they will receive before year-end, which will also improve their financial position.
For the quarter ending September 30, 2020, we achieved $0.95 per share in earnings.
That compares to $0.97 per share for the same period in 2019.
For the nine months ending September, we achieved $3.31 per share in earnings compared to $2.72 per share for the same period in 2019, which is reflective of the gains we recorded during 2020 for real estate dispositions.
For our three FFO performance metrics per diluted common share for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, NAREIT FFO and normalized FFO were both flat at $1.42 and adjusted FFO increased 1.5% to $1.34 per share.
A reconciliation to NHI's cash NOI can be found on Page 18 of our Q3 2020 SEC filed supplemental.
For the quarter ending September 30, cash NOI increased 1.2% to $75.3 million compared to $74.4 million in the prior year period.
However, reflecting Q3 rent deferrals, cash NOI was down 2.8% sequentially from the second quarter.
As a result, today, we're announcing additional rent deferrals for Bickford, which together with other previously announced rent deferrals, will impact cash NOI growth by up to approximately $5.5 million over the next two quarters or approximately 3.5% of our trailing six-month cash NOI before deferrals.
Our debt capital metrics for the quarter ending September 30 were our net debt to annualized EBITDA at 4.8 times, weighted average debt maturity at 2.9 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 6.3 times.
We ended the quarter with $1.53 billion in total debt, of which 91% was unsecured.
For the quarter ended September 30, the weighted average cost of debt was 2.96%.
At the beginning of the third quarter, we added liquidity to the balance sheet through a new $100 million one-year -- with one-year option to extend term loan.
Loan carries a variable interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 185 basis points with a 50 basis point LIBOR floor.
At October 31, we had $252 million in availability under our $550 million revolver and $38.2 million in unrestricted cash.
In addition, during the third quarter, we sold 79,155 shares in NHI's stock through our ATM program at an average price of $65.35 per share, raising approximately $4.8 million in net proceeds.
We have approximately $495 million capacity remaining under our ATM program, which was filed together with our shelf in February of this year.
In mid-September, we declared our third quarterly -- quarter dividend of $1.1025, which was just funded November 6.
I'm pleased to report to you that we continue to pay our dividend with an AFFO payout ratio in the low-80% range without significant further cash flow burdens from routine capital expenditures.
Our Board is committed to our financial policies, including our commitment to maintain our leverage between 4 times and 5 times net debt to EBITDA.
Active resident cases peaked in late July at 483 cases across our portfolio and then trended down to 161 cases in early October.
In our last two updates, cases have started to climb again, and we're at 367 active resident cases across 81 communities.
The active cases represent about 1.5% of our unit capacity.
Nearly 75% of the cases are in our SNFs, some of which are actively admitting COVID patients.
On the senior housing side, our operators continue to limit the spread as active resident cases per community was at 2.4 last week, which matches the average since we started reporting the data in mid-March.
We received 96.6% of our third quarter contractual rent and 97.8% of October rent.
In addition to the Bickford deferral, we agreed to defer or abate approximately $570,000 of rents for the remainder of 2020, with another tenant that will also grant that tenant the option to defer approximately $450,000 of rents related to the first quarter of 2021.
We do have credit enhancements in our leases with many of our senior housing operators, which totaled approximately $37.1 million in cash or letters of credit in addition to guarantees, and we have excellent credit from our SNF operators.
Our needs-driven senior housing operators, which account for 32% of our annualized cash revenue, were hit hard at the onset of the crisis, but did level-off through the second and third quarters as move-in activity picked up enough to slow the pace of occupancy losses.
As Eric mentioned, assisted living operators are now included as eligible providers beginning with Phase 2 of the Provider Relief Fund, which equates to approximately 2% of 2019 revenue, which most of our operators have or expect to receive.
Phase 3 applications were due by November 6.
Bickford, our largest assisted living operator representing 15% of annualized cash revenue, experienced an 80 basis point sequential decline in third quarter average occupancy, which compared to 270 basis point decline in the prior quarter comparison.
Our entrance fee communities, which account for nearly 25% of our annualized cash revenue, have proven to be resilient as the average length of stay at these properties ranges from six years to 10 years and the residents are often younger and healthier than what is typical in our other discretionary senior housing models.
Senior living communities, which represent 16% of our cash revenue, had third quarter average occupancy of 79%, which was down just 10 basis points from the second quarter.
September average occupancy was 78.9%.
EBITDARM coverage for SLC was unchanged sequentially at 1.06 times.
Our rental independent living communities, which account for 13% of our annualized cash revenue, have experienced a more pronounced and sustained occupancy decline than our needs-driven and CCRC assets.
Holiday Retirement, which represents 11% of annualized cash revenue, had average occupancy of 79.6% in the third quarter, which was down 390 basis points sequentially.
This followed a 380 basis point decline in the second quarter.
The occupancy continued to decline throughout the quarter and September's average occupancy was 78.5%.
EBITDARM coverage slightly ticked down from 1.2 times to 1.18 times as of the second quarter.
The skilled nursing portfolio, which represents 27% of annualized cash revenue, is anchored by two strong tenants in NHC and the Ensign Group who contributed 12% and 8% of annualized cash revenue respectively.
EBITDARM coverage for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 2.89 times, which improved from 2.81 times reported in the prior quarter.
We have announced $204.7 million in year-to-date investments.
During the third quarter, we exercised our purchase option to acquire The Courtyard at Bellevue for $12.3 million.
This is a 43-unit assisted living and memory care community in Bellevue, Wisconsin, which was opened in March 2019 and was 100% occupied upon our acquisition.
The long-term triple-net lease on Bellevue replaces a $3.9 million second mortgage that we had secured in January of this year.
The property is operated by 41 Management, which is a growing operating partner of ours that now includes eight properties.
We are encouraged by the depth of the current pipeline, as we expect we will have plenty of capital to recycle in the next 12 months from sources, including the previously mentioned Bickford portfolio sale, loan repayments, purchase options and other select dispositions.
