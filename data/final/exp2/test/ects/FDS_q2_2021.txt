Over the past 12 months, we've proven our resilience and our ability to strengthen our value to clients and we begin the second half of this fiscal year with good momentum, greater visibility and continued confidence in our ability to execute.
In our second quarter, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate accelerated to 5.5%.
We have reaffirmed our ability to deliver results within our guidance of fiscal '21 and are raising the lower end of our full-year organic ASV growth range to $70 million from $55 million.
The Americas growth accelerated to 6%, driven by strong sales of workstations and research and wealth solutions and data feeds in CTS solutions.

For the first half of fiscal 2021, we grew our revenue by 6%, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points and increased our adjusted earnings per share by 9% year-over-year.
As Phil stated earlier, we grew organic ASV plus professional services at 5.5%, an acceleration from the first quarter that reflects the diligent execution of our pipeline, powered by healthy demand for workstations and data feeds.
Ongoing investments in our core solutions continue to resonate with clients as reflected in our annual Americas price increase, which totaled $14 million, $2 million more than the prior year.
For the second quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 6% to $392 million, while organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization increased 5% to $389 million.
For our geographic segments, revenue growth for the Americas was at 7%, EMEA at 3% and Asia-Pacific at 10%.
GAAP operating expenses grew 5% in the second quarter to $276 million, impacted by a higher cost of sales.

As discussed on previous calls, we planned for an incremental investment spend of $15 million each year starting in 2020 through 2022.
While realizing some benefits from productivity and a delayed ramp up in hiring last year, we are on track to spend around $26 million in our fiscal FY '21.
Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 16% compared to last year's rate of 14%, primarily due to lower tax benefits realized from stock option exercises this quarter.
GAAP earnings per share increased 9% to $2.50 this quarter versus $2.30 in the prior year.
The adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 7% to $2.72.
Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending was $130 million for the quarter, an increase of 75% over the same period last year.

We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year, reaching over 6,000 clients for the first time in our history.
Our client retention improved to 90% year-over-year, which speaks both to the mission criticality of our solutions and the solid efforts of our sales teams.
Our user count grew 12% year-over-year and crossed the total of 150,000, largely due to additional wealth and research workstation users.
For the second quarter, we repurchased over 221,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $72 million at an average share price of $322.
Our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $206 million to our share repurchase program, bringing the total size to $350 million, in line with recent years.
Given our solid first half performance and improved visibility for the rest of the year, we are bringing up the lower end of our organic ASV plus professional services growth guidance range from $55 million to $70 million, so our full range is now $70 million to $85 million.
