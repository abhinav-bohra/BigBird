Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $251 million or $2.63 per share, excluding the special items, third quarter 2021 net income was $257 million or $2.69 per share compared to third quarter 2020 net income of $149 million or $1.57 per share.
Third quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020.
Total company EBITDA for the third quarter excluding the special items was $464 million in 2021 and $323 million in 2020.
Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.06 per share primarily for certain costs at the Jackson Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities while last year's third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.11 per share that were related primarily to the impact of Hurricane Laura on the DeRidder, Louisiana mill.
Excluding the special items, the $1.12 per share increase in third quarter 2021 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices in mix of $1.58 and volume $0.62 in our Packaging segment.
Higher production volume of $0.06 in prices in mix of $0.05 in our Paper segment and lower non-operating pension expense $0.03 and lower interest expense $0.01.
The items were partially offset by operating costs, which were $0.84 per share higher, primarily due to inflation-related increases, particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses, recycled fiber costs, energy, repairs, materials and supplies, as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas.
We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were $0.10 per share higher.
For the last several quarters, freight and logistics costs have risen, and were $0.23 per share higher compared to last year, driven by significant increases in fuel costs, tight truck supply, driver shortages, and the higher mix of spot pricing to keep up with box demand.
And finally, scheduled outage expenses were $0.04 per share higher than last year.
And sales volume in our Paper segment was lower by $0.02 per share.
EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter of 2021 of $467 million with sales of $1.8 billion, resulted in a margin of 26% versus last year's EBITDA of $324 million with sales of $1.5 billion and a 22% margin.
After successfully completing the planned maintenance outage at the Jackson mill during the third quarter, the mill restarted with the number 1 machine making corrugated medium rather uncoated freesheet grades, utilizing a mix of Virgin Kraft and DLK fiber based on the needs of our customers.
Similar to the number 3 machine at Jackson, the smaller number 1 machine is highly efficient.
We will continue to serve our paper customers with both machines at our International Falls mill, which is capable of producing all of Jackson's paper grades as well as available inventory produced on the number 1 machine at Jackson.
Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.40 per share above the third quarter of 2020 and up $0.55 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021.
Export containerboard prices were up $0.18 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up $0.06 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021.
We had record third quarter corrugated products shipments, which were up 2.3% in total and per workday over last year's very strong third quarter.
Through the first three quarters of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 6.7% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 4.5%.
In addition to supplying the record internal needs of our box plants, our outside sales volume of containerboard was 73,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 37,000 tons higher than the second quarter of 2021.
Under the terms of the agreement, PCA will acquire a modern full line 500,000 square foot corrugated products facility located in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
After completion of the acquisition, our containerboard integration is expected to increase by almost 80,000 tons.
EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $18 million with sales of $150 million or 12% margin compared to third quarter 2020 EBITDA of $17 million and sales of $178 million or 9% margin.
Prices and mix were up 4% from last year's third quarter and also moved 4% higher from the second and into the third quarter of 2021 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases.
As we mentioned last quarter, we finished goods inventory now at optimal levels for the paper business, sales volume, which was 19% below last year's level, is fairly reflective of our production capability.
As I said earlier, while the Jackson number 1 machine is running medium, we will continue to service our paper customers' needs from both of the International Falls machines, which are capable of producing all of the Jackson paper grades.
Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $284 million with free cash flow of $134 million.
The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $150 million, common stock dividends totaled $95 million, $68 million for federal and state income tax payments.
Pension and other post-employment benefit contributions of $51 million, and net interest payments of $7 million.
During the third quarter, we issued $700 million of 30-year, 3.05% notes and used the proceeds from these notes to redeem our 4.5%, $700 million, 2023 notes in early October.
This transaction will lower our average annual cash interest rate from 3.8% to 3.4%, lower our annual interest expense by $11 million per year, and extend our average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years.
Excluding this transaction, our quarter-end cash on hand balance was just over $1 billion or $1.2 billion, including marketable securities with liquidity at September 30th of $1.5 billion.
Our planned annual maintenance expense for the quarter is still expected to be about $0.41 per share or about $0.06 per share primarily due to the DeRidder mill outage.
This will result of negative impact of $0.25 per share moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and $0.18 per share higher than last year's fourth quarter.
We currently expect to end the year with total capital spending around $550 million.
And lastly, as Bob mentioned, we expect scheduled outage cost to be approximately $0.25 per share higher than the third quarter.
Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.04 per share.
