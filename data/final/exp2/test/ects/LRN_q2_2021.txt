Our We Stand Together College Scholarship, a $10 million multi-year commitment to support underrepresented students.
We held an Investor Day to outline our strategy and growth trajectory through fiscal year 2025, a trajectory that I believe we are well on track to hit and we raised almost $360 million through a convertible note offering to facilitate further investment in both organic and inorganic growth.
In our General Education business, we saw student enrollment increase by almost 50%.
Our Career Learning business finished the year with over $250 million in revenue.
This is an increase from less than $10 million just four years ago, a 150% compounded annual growth.
This year, we saw a growth of over 125% to almost 30,000 students.
We will continue our focus on IT and healthcare training because these industries are projected to add more than 2.5 million new positions in the US by 2029.
We will also look for ways to invest behind and expand our adult learning offerings with a lens for making Career Learning a $1 billion plus business.
So by 2030, our goals are to graduate over 100,000 students from our Stride career high school program, to graduate hundreds of thousands of students from our adult programs, and to achieve leading graduation of learning growth rates for over a million students.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised consumer awareness around the need for and the benefits of online education in grades K through 12 and in adult learning.
We still anticipate achieving revenue of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, adjusted operating income of $250 million to $350 million by the year 2025.
Revenue for the full fiscal year 2021 was $1.54 billion, an increase of 48% over the prior fiscal year.
Adjusted operating income was $161.4 million, up 160% compared to the prior year.
Capital expenditures were $52.3 million, an increase of $7.3 million over last year.
Revenue from our General Education business increased $346 million or 37% to $1.28 billion.
General ed enrollments rose 45% year-over-year to more than 156,000, while revenue per enrollment declined 5%.
Career Learning revenue rose to $256.6 million in FY '21, an increase of 140%.
Gross margins were 34.8%, up 140 basis points compared to fiscal 2020, driven by an increased contribution from the higher margin adult learning businesses and lower costs from efficiencies and automation initiatives.
We are confident that we will achieve our 36% to 39% gross margin targets much sooner than fiscal 2025, which was our original target communicated during our November 2020 Investor Day.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $424.4 million, up 35% from fiscal 2020.
Adjusted EBITDA of $239.9 million reflects an increase of 87% over FY '20.
Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 400 basis points from 12% of revenue in FY '20 to 16% in FY '21.
Stock-based compensation expense came in at $39.3 million, up 67% year-over-year, driven by the timing of certain stock-based grants tied to our Career Learning business.
We currently expect stock-based compensation expense to decline to a range of $30 million to $34 million in FY '22.
Interest expense totaled $18 million for fiscal 2021, in line with the expectations we provided last quarter.
This consisted of approximately $5 million in cash interest and $13 million in non-cash amortization of the discount in fees on our convertible senior notes.
Our full year tax rate for FY '21 was 26%, below the guidance range we provided last quarter.
In FY '22, we anticipate an increase in non-deductible compensation that will cause our tax rate to be closer to the 28% to 30% range.
Capital expenditures for the year totaled $52.3 million, up 16% from the prior year, due mainly to higher capitalized software development costs associated with adult learning, automation and improvements to our platforms.
Capex, as a percent of revenue was 3.4% and that is lower than our historical average of approximately 4% to 5% over the past few years.
Free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capex totaled $81.9 million for FY 2021.
This was approximately $45 million below the expectations provided at Investor Day last November due entirely to the timing of receipts, which drove lower than expected cash from operations.
Finally, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $386.1 million, an increase of $173.8 million compared to the same period a year ago.
Our Career Learning assets, which accounted for less than $7 million of revenue four years ago, generated over a quarter billion dollars in revenue during the year, a sign of the tremendous demand for Career Education offerings, and Stride's innovation and leading position within this market.
