Earnings from continuing operations were 232.9 million or $1.90 per diluted share on net sales of 2 billion.
Excluding the impact of a tax benefit related to an international reorganization, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 199.2 million or $1.62 per diluted share.
CMC generated core EBITDA of 326.8 million, an increase of 109% from the year-ago period and an improvement of 28% from the prior quarter.
However, to put this performance into context, during the fiscal 2014 and 2015 time period, we experienced similar robust market conditions to what we enjoy today, and our 12-month EBITDA was between 375 million and 400 million with return on invested capital in the mid-single digits.
To back up this statement, CMC achieved an annualized return on invested capital of 25.1% during the first quarter and an annualized return on equity of 35.6%.
CMC was founded 106 years ago as a metals recycler, and we carry on that legacy today, operating possibly the cleanest portfolio of steel mills in the world.
We're also committed to further improvement as we make significant progress toward our 2030 environmental goals.
CMC's Scope 1 and 2 emissions are already well under the 2040 Paris Accords target, and our emissions have improved by 6.2% per ton of steel produced compared to our fiscal 2019 baseline.
Since fiscal 2019, we've also improved our energy efficiency by 7.8%, while the global industry's performance has deteriorated by nearly 6%.
We are sourcing more renewable energy than ever before, and the proportion of green energy within our overall consumption has risen by roughly 3 percentage points over the last two years, and we continue to work every angle to move this figure higher.
Our commitment to renewable sourcing is demonstrated by the design of our future Arizona 2 micro mill now under construction in Mesa.
Arizona 2, as we are calling it, provides significant strategic value to CMC.
Arizona 2 will also give CMC a coast-to-coast merchant bar footprint and serve several customers we already know well through our MBQ operations in Alabama, South Carolina, and Texas.
Importantly, Arizona 2 will help further optimize CMC's operational network and enhance customer service.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed last November will provide 1.2 trillion in funding over five years and stimulate an estimated 1 million to 1.5 million tons of incremental annual rebar demand at full run rate.
This would add roughly 15% to current domestic consumption of around 8.5 million tons.
We expect the time between the bill's enactment and the commencement of significant construction activity to be in the range of 18 to 24 months, which lines up very well with the scheduled future commissioning of Arizona 2.
The two U.S. mill expansions plus the Tensar acquisition, combined with our recently commissioned rolling line in Europe, should provide CMC with at least 200 million of sustainable through-the-cycle EBITDA once fully operational.
CMC's transformational growth projects over the last several years have expanded our North American business by nearly 50%, necessitating organizational adjustment to accommodate such rapid growth.
This represents CMC's 229th consecutive quarterly dividend with the amount paid per share increasing 17% from a year ago.
As Barbara noted, we reported record fiscal first quarter 2022 earnings from continuing operations of 232.9 million or $1.90 per diluted share, more than triple prior-year levels of 63.9 million and $0.53, respectively.
Results this quarter include a net after-tax benefit of 33.7 million, primarily related to a tax capital loss recognition on an international tax restructuring transaction, which took place in the quarter.
Excluding the impact of this item, the adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 199.2 million or $1.62 per diluted share.
Core EBITDA from continuing operations was 326.8 million for the first quarter of 2022, more than double the 156.6 million generated during the prior-year period.
Both our North America and Europe segments contributed significantly to year-over-year earnings growth, while core EBITDA per ton of finished steel reached a record level of $233 per ton.
The first quarter marked the 11th consecutive quarter in which CMC generated an annualized return on invested capital at or above 10%, which is in excess of our cost of capital.
The North American segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of 268.5 million for the quarter, an all-time high.
This compares to adjusted EBITDA of 155.6 million in the same period last year.
Largest driver of this 73% improvement was a significant increase in margins on steel products and raw materials.
Selling prices for steel products for our mills increased by $364 per ton on a year-over-year basis and $76 per ton sequentially.
Margin over scrap on steel products increased $202 per ton from a year ago and $82 per ton sequentially.
The average selling price of downstream products increased by $158 per ton from the prior year, reaching $1,092.
Downstream product shipments increased by nearly 8% from the prior period, driven by the beneficial impact of our growing construction backlog.
Turning to Slide 11 of the supplemental deck, our Europe segment generated record adjusted EBITDA of 79.8 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to adjusted EBITDA of 14.5 million in the prior-year period.
This improvement was driven by expanded margins over scrap, the receipt of a 15.5 million energy credit, and strong profit contributions from our new rolling line.
Margins over scrap increased $236 per ton on a year-over-year basis and were up $120 per ton from the prior quarter.
Tight market conditions provided the backdrop to achieve the segment's highest average selling price in more than a decade, reaching $869 per ton during the first quarter.
This level represented an increase of $408 per ton compared to a year ago and $106 per ton sequentially.
Europe volumes climbed 8% compared to the prior year as a result of extensive planned maintenance performed at our rebar rolling line.
Turning to capital allocation, balance sheet, and liquidity, as of November 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled 415 million.
In addition, we had approximately 650 million of availability under our credit and accounts receivable programs, bringing total liquidity to nearly 1.1 billion.
In addition, as we announced last week, in late December, we closed on the sale of our Rancho Cucamonga California site and received gross proceeds of 313 million.
Proceeds received represent approximately 45% of the entire purchase price of the rebar acquisition we completed in 2019.
During the second quarter, we will record a pre-tax gain of approximately 275 million related to this transaction.
During the quarter, we generated 26 million of cash from operating activities despite a $252 million increase in working capital.
Over the course of the past four quarters, CMC has invested roughly $500 million in working capital.
As can be seen on Slide 15, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now sits at just 0.7 times, while our net debt to capitalization is 18%.
CMC's effective tax rate was 11%, which was driven sharply below our typical statutory rates by the international reorganization performed during the quarter.
Absent the enactment of any corporate tax legislation that would impact fiscal 2022, we forecast our tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26% for the balance of the year.
With respect to CMC's fiscal 2022 capital spending outlook, we currently expect to invest 475 million to 525 million this year, roughly half of which will be attributable to Arizona 2.
Lastly, after approving the program in mid-October, CMC repurchased 159,500 shares during the first fiscal quarter of 2022 at an average price of $33.28 per share.
These transactions amounted to approximately 5.3 million, leaving 344 million remaining under the current authorization.
During CMC's first quarter, total domestic construction spending increased roughly 10% from the prior year, according to U.S. Census Bureau, driven by growth in both residential and private nonresidential categories.
The Portland Cement Association once again increased its expectation for cement consumption growth in 2022 and now anticipates an increase of 2.5% on a year-over-year basis.
