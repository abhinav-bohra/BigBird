We executed with discipline to deliver record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $238 million and adjusted class A earnings per share of $1.93, fueled by strong volumes and ongoing strategic pricing actions as we continue to experience strong demand across our global portfolio.
Our leverage ratio fell at 2.8 times, and our board approved a $0.02 and a $0.03 increase to our class A and class B quarterly dividend, respectively, payable on October 1.
Our global steel drum volume increased by 8% per day.
Our global rigid IBCs and large plastic drum volumes both rose by more than 25% per day.
In Latin America, steel drum volumes rose by 15% on a per day basis versus the prior year and benefited from improved industrial trends and a strong agricultural and citrus season.
In EMEA, third-quarter steel drum and rigid IBC volumes increased by roughly 5% and 28% per day, respectively, with strong improvement across most key end markets.
And finally, in APAC, steel drum volumes rose by 7% per day versus the prior year.
GIP's third-quarter adjusted EBITDA was a record and rose by roughly $62 million due to higher sales, partially offset by higher SG&A expense, mainly attributed to higher incentive accruals.
The business also benefited from a $9 million operating tax recovery in Brazil and an $8 million FX tailwind.
Please recall that GIP's Q3 2020 results included an opportunistic sourcing benefit of $5 million that did not recur.
Paper packaging's third-quarter sales rose by roughly $120 million versus the prior year, attributed to stronger volumes and higher selling prices due to increases in published containerboard and boxboard prices.
Adjusted EBITDA rose by roughly $18 million versus the prior year due to higher sales, partially offset by higher transportation and raw material headwinds, including a $24 million OCC drag.
Since early June, we've announced five price increases, including a total of $100 a ton on CRB, $120 a ton in total on URB, and $70 a ton on containerboard.
As of August, the published indexes recognized $50 a ton on the CRB increases, $50 a ton on the URB increases, and a $50 and $60 a ton on linerboard and medium, respectively.
Third-quarter volumes in CorrChoice, our corrugated sheet feeder system, were up roughly 27% per day versus the prior year and are anticipated to stay strong through the fiscal fourth quarter.
Third-quarter specialty sales, which includes litho-laminate, triple-wall bulk packaging, and coatings, were up more than 38% versus the prior year.
Third-quarter net sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, rose 34% versus the prior-year quarter due to stronger volumes and higher selling prices and were a record.
Adjusted EBITDA rose by $78 million and was also a record.
As Pete mentioned, EBITDA results include a $9 million Brazilian tax refund from overpayment of revenue-based taxes to the government that occurred in prior periods and were wrongly levied.
Keep in mind, our adjusted EBITDA result overcame more than $50 million of combined OCC and incentive headwinds versus the prior year, making our performance that much more impressive.
Interest expense fell by roughly $6 million versus the prior-year quarter due to lower debt balances, lower interest rates and a lower interest rate tier on our credit facility as a result of our substantial debt repayment.
Our third-quarter GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate were both 22% and were flat to prior year.
Third-quarter adjusted class A earnings per share more than doubled to $1.93 per share.
Finally, third-quarter adjusted cash flow fell by roughly $43 million versus the prior year.
That said, our team is executing with discipline and controlling what it can with superb results as trailing fourth-quarter working capital as a percentage of sales improved by 190 basis points year over year to 10.7%.
At the midpoint, we anticipate generating Class A earnings per share of $5.20, which is $0.50 per share more than our guide at Q2.
With our anticipated fiscal '21 result, we will more -- have more than doubled earnings per share since 2015 despite COVID-19's negative impact, the closure and/or divestiture of nearly 90 non-core or suboptimal plants and without any share repurchase benefit.
Also keep in mind that we currently have 600,000 more shares outstanding now versus the end of 2015.
We now anticipate generating between $335 million and $365 million in adjusted free cash flow, with a bias to the upside of that range.
At the midpoint, adjusted free cash flow has improved by $45 million relative to our Q2 guide due to improved earnings, slightly lower capital expenditures and cash tax savings, partially offset by higher working capital usage commensurate with our announced price increases to offset cost inflation.
We have executed on an aggressive deleveraging plan and repaid $370 million in total debt since Q3 2020.
Given the dramatic improvement in our leverage profile and confidence in strong future cash generation, the Board approved a 4.5% increase to our quarterly dividend effective this year.
