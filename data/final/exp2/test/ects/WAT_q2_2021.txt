As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies.
Sales for this quarter represent a 6% compounded average yearly growth versus our 2019 results on a constant currency basis.
This translates to a 7% stacked CAGR versus 2019 for the first half of the year, again, on a constant currency basis.
Our strong top line growth resulted in year-over-year Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 24% to $2.60 per share.
First, by operating segment, our Waters Division grew 27%, while TA grew by 32% on a constant currency basis.
By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 31% in constant currency; industrial grew 28%; and academia and government grew 7%.
Turning to academic and government, which is less than 10% of our business, growth in the U.S. and Europe was partially offset by lumpiness in China.
Sales in Asia grew 28%, with China up almost 40% and India up almost 60%.
Sales in the Americas grew 28% with the U.S. growing 26%, and sales in Europe grew 25%.
In the second quarter, LC instruments grew across all major geographies with more than 40% growth, driven by our instrument replacement initiatives and new products, especially Arc HPLC and a strong uptake of our Premier instruments, both Arc and ACQUITY lines.
Mass spec sales grew in excess of 30%, driven by demand from pharma research and development and food and environmental applications.
Sales of precision chemistry columns, sample prep kits and reagents grew 28%, driven by increased utilization by our pharma customers and improved industrial demand.
This segment grew 60% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2019.
As you will see on Slide 9, Waters already has a strong foundation in large and growing end markets with a leading position of science and innovation in a roughly $65 billion market, a high exposure to end markets that grow around mid-single digits with a deep rooted presence in regulated end markets like QA/QC, a large installed base of instruments with over 50% recurring revenues, a diversified geographic base with over -- almost 40% sales in Asia and industry-leading margins with a strong financial flexibility.
As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $682 million in the second quarter, an increase of 27% in constant currency.
Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 31%.
Looking at the product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents combination of chemistry and service revenue, increased by 18% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 40%.
Chemistry revenues were up 28%, and service revenues were up 13%.
While our COVID cost savings plan was successful totaling approximately $100 million for 2020, it does have some implications in our year-over-year comparisons as we normalize from an abnormally low expense base.
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by 80 basis points foreign exchange headwinds.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, gross margin improved by 70 basis points despite higher instrument mix and COVID cost actions in 2020.
Moving down the P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 39% on a constant currency basis and 42% on a reported basis.
In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%, a decrease from last year as the comparable period included some unfavorable discrete items.
Our average share count came in at 62.2 million shares, approximately flat versus the second quarter of last year.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 24% to $2.60 in comparison to $2.10 last year.
On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.69 compared to $1.98 last year.
In the second quarter of 2021, free cash flow declined 12% year-over-year to $155 million after funding $37 million of capital expenditures.
Excluded from the free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations, a $38 million tax reform payment and a $3 million litigation settlement received.
In the second quarter, this resulted in $0.23 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow.
Year-to-date, free cash flow has increased 17% to $348 million.
In the second quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 73 days, down 14 days compared to the second quarter of last year.
Inventories increased slightly by $5 million in comparison to the prior year.
In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 535,000 shares of our common stock for $168 million in the second quarter.
At the end of second quarter, our net debt position was $940 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.
These dynamics support updated full year 2021 guidance of 13% to 15% constant currency sales growth.
At current rates, the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately one to two percentage points, resulting in a full year reported sales growth guidance of 14% to 17%.
Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29%.
We expect our full year net interest expense to be $37 million and full year tax rate to be 15%.
Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately 62 million.
Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range $10.50 to $10.70.
Looking at the third quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 9%.
At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add approximately one percentage point, resulting in third quarter reported sales growth guidance of 8% to 10%.
Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.25 to $2.35.
