Net sales increased by 6.3% during the fourth quarter of 2020, mainly due to increased demand for our products across all of our operating segments.
Conversely, net sales decreased to $851.6 million for the full-year 2020, compared to $893.9 million in 2019.
We reported net income of $22.2 million or $0.68 per diluted share for the three months ended October 31, 2020, compared to a net loss of $30.9 million or $0.94 per diluted share during the three months ended October 31, 2019.
For fiscal 2020, we reported net income of $38.5 million or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $46.7 million or $1.42 per diluted share for fiscal 2019.
The reported net losses in 2019 were primarily attributable to a $44.6 million noncash goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of last year and a $30 million noncash goodwill impairment in the second quarter of last year both in the North American cabinet components segment, mainly due to lower volume expectations related to the shift in the market from semi-custom to stock cabinets and customer-specific strategy changes.
On an adjusted basis, net income was $22 million or $0.67 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $14 million or $0.42 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Adjusted net income was $40.7 million or $1.24 per diluted share for fiscal 2020, compared to $31.4 million or $0.95 per diluted share for fiscal '19.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA increased by 14.3% to $39.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and compared to $34.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
For the full-year 2020, adjusted EBITDA increased by almost 2% to $104.5 million, compared to $102.7 million in 2019.
The increases in earnings for the 12 months ended October 31, 2020, were primarily driven by a decrease in SG&A expenses, mainly due to lower medical costs.
Cash provided by operating activities was $100.8 million for the 12 months ended October 31, 2020, which represents an increase of 4.6% when compared to $96.4 million for the 12 months ended October 31, 2019.
We generated free cash flow of $75.1 million in 2020, compared to $71.5 million in 2019.
As a result of our strong free cash flow profile, we repurchased $7.2 million in stock and repaid $39.5 million of bank debt during fiscal 2020, $35 million of which was repaid in the fourth quarter alone.
Our liquidity position is strong and getting stronger, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA improved to 0.6 times as of October 31, 2020, which is 50% lower than where we exited fiscal 2019.
In fact, the interest rate on our revolver will drop by another 25 basis points to the lowest tier, which is LIBOR plus 125 basis points.
Overall, on a consolidated basis, this should equate to net sales of approximately $900 million to $920 million, and we expect to generate between $108 million and $118 million in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2021.
Depreciation of approximately $33 million, amortization of approximately $14 million, SG&A of $95 million to $100 million, interest expense of $3.5 million to $4.5 million and a tax rate of approximately 26%.
From a capex standpoint, we expect to spend about $30 million in 2021.
Our goal is to generate free cash flow of approximately $60 million in fiscal 2021.
As Scott mentioned, we generated net sales of $851.6 million in 2020, which was 4.7% lower than 2019.
According to KCMA data, the semi-custom cabinet market grew by 5.7% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the 5.9% growth we reported in our North American cabinet components segment.
If you adjust for the customer that exited the cabinet business in late 2019, this operating segment grew by over 9% in 4Q.
Year to date through October, the semi custom market is down 3.9% versus the same period of 2019, primarily due to the negative demand impact the pandemic had in 2Q and 3Q.
Revenue in our North American cabinet components segment decreased by 8.5% year over year.
Our North American fenestration segment reported revenue of $142 million in Q4, which was down only slightly from prior-year fourth quarter.
Absent this loss, the segment grew at 3.9% year over year in Q4, which compares favorably to industry shipments.
Adjusted EBITDA of $23.8 million in this segment was $1.1 million or 4.8% better than prior-year fourth quarter.
We generated revenue of $56.8 million in our European fenestration segment in Q4, which was $13 million or 29.6% higher than prior year or up 36.6% after excluding the foreign exchange impact.
Adjusted EBITDA of $13.4 million in Q4 was also a record quarter and represents margin improvement of approximately 460 basis points over prior year.
Our North American cabinet components segment reported net sales of $57.5 million in Q4, which was 5.9% better than prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $4.6 million, which represents an increase of 53.8% compared to prior-year fourth quarter.
Finally, unallocated corporate and SG&A costs were $2.9 million higher than prior-year fourth quarter.
As Scott stated earlier, we expect to deliver net sales of $900 million to $920 million and adjusted EBITDA of $108 million to $118 million in 2021.
We will continue to invest in the business while still expecting to generate approximately $60 million of free cash flow.
