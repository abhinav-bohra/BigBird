Despite the pandemic and the economic downturn, Everest remains profitable, as reflected in our reported 98.6% combined ratio or 89.9% excluding catastrophe losses and the pandemic IBNR loss provision.
Additionally, Everest remains resilient, as reflected by both our 21% growth rate in gross written premium and by our capital position.
We have built a strong capital foundation over the years, holding $8.6 billion of shareholders' equity at March 31, 2020.
We have substantial liquidity from the cash we hold, and the cash flow from operations, which was over $0.5 billion for the quarter, were up 10% from 2019.
We have significant access to capital markets, including plenty of debt capacity as we carry very little debt compared to all of our peers at less than 7% of our capital when most of our peers typically carry upwards of 20% to 30%.
We demonstrated excellent momentum across both of our Reinsurance and Insurance businesses with gross written premium growth of 16% and 33%, respectively.
Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, our underlying combined ratios for the group at 89.9% and each of our divisions, Reinsurance at 87.7% and Insurance at 95.6%, are reflective of the strong underwriting performance across the group and the earnings generating power of the franchise.
Excluding workers' compensation, the rate increase was plus 24% or plus 17% net of a handful of large deals booked in the quarter and over 12% including workers' compensation.
This is an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019 where the rate increase was almost plus 12% excluding workers' compensation and plus 4% all in.
Net investment income of $148 million was up 5% from the first quarter of 2019.
Our investment portfolio had been and is defensively positioned with over 75% in investment-grade fixed income bonds and less than 4% allocated to public equities.
As per our April 23 announcement, we have taken $150 million IBNR loss provision in the first quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Only a very small number of policies have endorsed sublimits typically less than $25,000 and with short-duration caps that would offer BI for a notable notifiable human disease.
Everest reported net income of $17 million for the first quarter of 2020.
This compares to net income of $355 million for the first quarter of 2019.
Net income included $172 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $74 million of capital gains in the first quarter last year.
Operating income for the quarter was $164 million driven by strong underwriting results across the group, stable net investment income and lower catastrophe losses, offset by a COVID-19 pandemic IBNR loss estimate of $150 million.
The overall underwriting gain for the group was $29 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $196 million in the same period last year.
In the first quarter of 2020, Everest saw $30 million of catastrophe losses related to fires and hailstorms in Australia and a tornado in Nashville, Tennessee.
This compares to $25 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2019.
The combined ratio was 98.6% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 88.7% for the first quarter of 2019.
Excluding the catastrophe events and the impact of the COVID pandemic, comparable combined ratios were 89.9% for the first quarter of 2020 and 87.4% for the first quarter of 2019.
Excluding the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, the attritional loss ratio was 61.5%, up from 60.2% for the full year 2019 primarily due to the continued change in business mix.
For the Reinsurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, was 59.8%, up from 58.2% for the full year of 2019.
For the Insurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, remained very steady at 66.1%, essentially flat compared to 66% for the full year 2019.
The group commission ratio of 22% was down slightly compared to prior year.
The group expense ratio remains low at 6.3% and was higher than last year due to an increase in nonrecurring incentive compensation, benefits and payroll taxes in the first quarter, which will normalize during the rest of the year.
For investments, pre-tax investment income was $148 million for the quarter from our $20 billion investment portfolio.
Investment income was 5% above the first quarter of last year.
Pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, about flat compared to one year ago.
For our investment-grade portfolio, the new money rate was 2.7% for the quarter.
Other income included $21 million of foreign exchange gains in the quarter.
On income taxes, the $60 million tax benefit for the quarter included a $31 million tax benefit related to the CARES Act, which extended the carryback period for cat losses to five years.
Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on operating income was 12%, in line with our expected tax rate for the full year.
Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flow of $506 million compared to $460 million for the first quarter of 2019.
Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019.
The movement in shareholders' equity since year-end 2019 is primarily attributable to the sharp decline in the fair value of the investment portfolio and by capital return for $200 million of share buybacks and $63 million of dividends paid in the quarter.
The reduction in investment portfolio valuation came from the realized losses in the equity portfolio and the $248 million mark-to-market impact on the fixed income assets resulting from the widening of credit spreads.
Like the rest of the group, the Reinsurance division, supported by our dedicated IT colleagues and our newly completed next-generation global underwriting platform was able to transition to 100% work from home without missing a beat.
During Q1, the Reinsurance division increased our gross written premium to a record of $1.8 billion, up 16% from last year.
Note that the volatility associated with $1 of pro rata premium is generally lower than $1 of excess premium, and combined ratio alone can obscure risk-adjusted returns.
By limit, our book is roughly 80% GSEs and 20% mortgage insurance.
