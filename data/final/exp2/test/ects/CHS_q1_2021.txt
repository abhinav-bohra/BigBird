Total first-quarter sales grew 38% over last year, spurred by Soma's extraordinary sales growth of 65%, as well as fantastic customer response to Chico's and White House Black Market, which drove 31% growth in our apparel brand.
Not only did Soma post a 65% sales growth over last year's first quarter, but comparable sales also grew a remarkable 39% over the first quarter of 2019.
Soma is well on its way to delivering an incremental 100 million in sales this year.
According to NPD research data, Soma outpaced the market leader in growth in bras, panties, and sleepwear, excluding sports bras, for the last 12 months.
These efforts are paying off as year-over-year first-quarter digital sales grew a very healthy 13.4%.
These tools fuel 10% sequential multi-channel customer growth, and these customers spend more than three times a single-channel customer.
The year-over-year average age of new customers dropped 10 years at Chico's.
One in three new customers is under 34, resulting from our more inclusive branding and evolved product assortment.
On-hand inventory levels, which were down 29% versus last year's first quarter and down 21% compared to the first quarter of 2019, drove more full-price sales and generated a solid gross margin in the first quarter.
We have successfully opened 30 Soma shop-in-shops inside Chico's stores.
These started opening in February, and we will have 47 open by mid-June.
We have lease flexibility with nearly 60% of our leases coming up for renewal or kickout available over the next three years.
We anticipate closing 13% to 16% of our remaining store fleet over the next three years, with 40 to 45 of those closures occurring in fiscal '21.
First-quarter net sales totaled $388 million, compared to $280 million last year.
This 38.4% increase reflects a 13.4% increase in digital sales, and recovery, and store sales, as our stores were temporally closed last year.
Looking at the first quarter compared to 2019, comparable sales decline 22%, with Soma up 39%, and the apparel brands down 33%.
Total company on-hand inventories for the first quarter compared to 2019 were down 21%, with Soma up 13% and the apparel brands down 35.3%, illustrating these strategic investments in Soma's growth and our turnaround strategy in apparel.
We reported a net loss of $8.9 billion, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $178 million, or $1.55 per diluted share last year, which included the $35 million, or $1.17 per diluted share and significant after-tax noncash charges.
Our gross margin was 32.7%, compared to negative 4% last year.
SG&A expenses for the first quarter total $134 million, just a modest uptick from the first quarter last year but our stores were closed for approximately half of the quarter.
We ended the first quarter with over $102 million in cash and marketable securities.
And borrowings on our $300 million credit facility remain unchanged from the fiscal year at $149 million.
In addition, our balance sheet reflects a federal income tax receivable of approximately $55 million that we expect to realize in the summer of fiscal '21.
Regarding first-quarter cash flows, cash used in operating activities was $4.4 million.
This use reflects the impact of more than $15 million in outflows or residual rental settlements for the fiscal '20 real estate rent abatement and reduction initiatives, as well as reductions in extended supply or payment terms implemented last year.
We have secured commitments from landlords of approximately $10 million of additional rent abatements and reductions.
This is an addition to the $65 million abatements and reductions negotiated last year.
On a cash basis, approximately $20 million of those savings are expected to be realized this year.
We expect to close up to a total of 330 stores from the beginning of fiscal '19 through the end of fiscal '23.
In the first quarter of fiscal '21, we closed nine stores and we ended the quarter with 1,293 boutiques.
We expect a consolidated year-over-year net sales improvement in the 28% to 34% range, gross margin rate improvement of 18 to 20 percentage points over last year.
SG&A as a percent of sales down 500 to 600 basis points year over year and income tax expense of approximately $500,000.
