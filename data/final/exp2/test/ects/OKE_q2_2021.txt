For 32 of my almost 40-year career, I had the good fortune to work with the assets and the people through various companies that are now a part of ONEOK.
Terry championed many companies' successes, the transition to higher fee-based business model with less commodity price exposure, significant improvements in companywide safety and environmental performance, the successful ONEOK Partners merger transaction and the completion of more than $10 billion in capital growth projects to name just a few of his many accomplishments.
The company has grown in many ways since I was here last, and I'm looking forward to building on what Terry, the board, the leadership team and ONEOK's 3,000 employees have achieved.
Our view of 2021 continues to improve as we now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.05 billion to $3.35 billion that we provided back in April.
ONEOK's second-quarter 2021 net income totaled $342 million or $0.77 per share.
Second-quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $802 million, a 50% increase year over year and a 3% increase compared with the first-quarter 2021 after backing out the benefit from winter storm Uri.
We expect to recognize $12.5 million of earnings in the second half of 2021 as our current inventory is fractionated and sold, the majority of which will be recognized in the third quarter.
Distributable cash flow was $570 million in the second quarter and dividend coverage was nearly 1.4 times.
We generated more than $150 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter.
Our June 30 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.3 times.
We ended the second quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and nearly $375 million in cash.
In July, the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter.
In our natural gas liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 17% compared with the first-quarter 2021.
Second-quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 18% compared with the first-quarter 2021 and more than 85% compared with the second-quarter 2020, which included significant production curtailments resulting from the pandemic.
As a reference point, volumes reached approximately 330,000 barrels per day in this region early this month.
At this volume level, we still have more than 100,000 barrels per day of NGL pipeline capacity from the region, allowing us to capture increasing volumes on our system including volume from a new 250 million cubic feet per day third-party plant that came online in early July and expansion of another third-party plant that is underway, and our Bear Creek plant expansion, which is expected to be complete in the first half of the fourth quarter this year.
Total mid-continent region raw feed throughput volumes increased 16% compared with the first-quarter 2021 and 10% compared with the second-quarter 2020.
The Arbuckle II expansion was completed in the second quarter, increasing its capacity up to 500,000 barrels per day, adding additional transportation capacity between the mid-continent region and the Gulf Coast.
In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 16% compared with the first-quarter 2021, primarily as a result of increased ethane recovery and producer activity.
Discretionary ethane on our system or said differently, the amount of ethane that we estimate could be operationally recovered at any given time but is not economic to recover at current prices without incentives, is approximately 225,000 barrels per day.
Of that total opportunity, 125,000 barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and 100,000 barrels per day in the mid-continent.
Full recovery in the Rockies region would provide an opportunity for $500 million in annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates.
In the Rocky Mountain region, second quarter processed volumes averaged more than 1.25 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of 6% compared with the first-quarter 2021 and more than 50% year over year.
An outage at one of our plants, which has since come back online, decreased second-quarter volumes by approximately 15 million cubic feet per day.
Towards the end of June, volumes reached 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, and we have line of sight to even higher processed volumes later in the year given the recent increase in completion crews and rigs in the basin.
Once in service, we will have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the basin, and we'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital.
In the second quarter, we connected 84 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and still expect to connect more than 300 this year.
There are currently 23 rigs operating in the basin with nine on our dedicated acreage, and there continues to be a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basinwide and approximately 325 on our dedicated acreage.
Since 2016, GORs have increased more than 75%.
Recent projections from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority show that even in a flat crude oil production environment, GORs could increase an additional 45% in the next seven years.
This could add 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of gas production and approximately 150,000 barrels per day of C3+ NGL volume to the basin during that same time period.
During the second quarter, the gathering and processing segment's average fee rate increased to $1.06 per MMBtu, driven by higher Rocky Mountain region volumes.
We now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu.
The mid-continent region average process volumes increased 4% compared with the first-quarter 2021 as volumes returned following freeze offs in the first quarter.
In the natural gas pipelines segment, the segment reported a solid quarter of stable fee-based earnings, the decrease in earnings year over year was driven by a onetime contract settlement that provided a $13.5 million benefit to earnings in the second quarter of 2020.
Since the first quarter, we have renewed or recontracted additional long-term storage capacity in both Texas and Oklahoma, including a successful open season for more than 1 billion cubic feet of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets.
The results achieved so far this year, only 12 months removed from the unprecedented conditions in the second quarter of 2020 are nothing short of amazing.
