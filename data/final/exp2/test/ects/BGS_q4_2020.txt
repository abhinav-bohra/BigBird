Fiscal 2020 base business net sales also benefited from $35.8 million in net pricing, inclusive of our spring 2019 list price increase, our 2019 trade spend optimization program as well as the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower than average daily trade promotions during the height of the pandemic.
FX was a drag on net sales of a little bit more than $1 million for the year.
We estimate that the extra reporting week in fiscal 2020, which occurred in the third quarter contributed approximately $35 million to our net sales.
Leading our brand performance was Green Giant, which reached approximately $639 million in net sales during fiscal 2020, marking an increase of $112.2 million or 21.3% for the year.

And as a result while our net sales growth was impressive with a $2.5 million increase or 7.3% compared to the prior year period, we could have done much more had we add incremental product supply.
Victoria was also one of the larger gainers in the portfolio, increasing net sales in fiscal 2020 by $11.3 million or 26.4% compared to the prior year.
Net sales of Victoria reached nearly $55 million in 2020.
While consumption remains strong throughout the year, net sales dropped approximately $0.6 million dollars or 4.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing shift of a large promotional event with one of our key club customers that moved from fourth quarter 2019 to the third quarter 2020.
Net sales of Maple Grove Farms were up by approximately $6.1 million or 8.7%, impressive performance given that a substantial portion of Maple Grove Farms business is sold through the foodservice channel, which went dark for a significant portion of the year.
Fourth quarter performance showed nice improvement as well, with net sales up $2.1 million or 12.2%, driven by continued strong consumption trends and an improvement in the foodservice side of the business.
Our spices & seasonings, including our legacy brands such as Ac'cent and Dash and the brands we acquired in 2016, such as Tones and Weber were up by $30.9 million or 9.2% for the year.

Excluding the negative impact of approximately $5 million of acquisition divestiture-related expenses, the amortization of acquisition-related inventory fair value step-up and non-recurring event -- expenses included in the cost of goods sold, our gross profit would have been $486.7 million, or 24.7% of net sales.
Gross profit was $383.1 million for fiscal 2019 or 23.1% of net sales.
Excluding the negative impact of approximately $22 million of acquisition divestiture-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related inventory fair value step-up and non-recurring expenses included in cost of goods sold our gross profit would have been $405.1 million, for 24.4% of net sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year were $186.2 million or 9.5% of net sales.
This compares favorably to the prior year as a percentage of net sales, which included $160.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses or 9.7% of fiscal 2019 net sales.
The dollar increase in SG&A was composed of increases in selling expenses of $8.2 million, increases in consumer marketing investments of $7.7 million, increases of warehousing expenses of $2 million and increases in G&A of $10.7 million.
These increases were offset in part by a reduction in acquisition divestiture-related and non-recurring expenses of $3.1 million.
As I mentioned earlier, we generated $374.8 million in adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses and after the inclusion of $13.5 million in COVID-19 expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $361.2 million.
This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $302.5 million in 2019.

We had another strong year for cash, with net cash provided by operating activities of $281.5 million, which more than supported our long-standing dividend policy and helped us reduce our net debt before taking into account debt incurred to finance the Crisco acquisition and our pro forma net leverage.
As a reminder, we began the year with net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA of approximately 6.12 times, we reached nearly 4.75 times at the end of the third quarter and finished the year with pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses of approximately 5.21 times, which is our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated for purposes of our credit agreement.
Our increase in net cash provided by operating activities allowed us to reduce net debt by approximately $135 million over the course of the year, excluding our acquisition of Crisco.
Our 2021 outlook includes an expectation for elevated net sales of our products in the early month, driven by consumption that has remained over 10% higher than pre-pandemic levels on a blended basis across the B&G Foods portfolio for nearly every week of the last 11 months.
However, what I can say is that we expect to generate company record net sales of $2.05 billion to $2.1 billion in 2021 inclusive of the full benefit of a full year of the Crisco acquisition.
Although there is no precise way to measure this, using IRI and other data sources, we believe that our online sales grew by roughly 150%, albeit from a relatively modest base.
Before COVID, roughly 13% of our net sales were to foodservice customers.
In 2020 that number decreased to 9% as foodservice sales softened and retail sales grew.
Household penetration of B&G Foods brands grew by 900 basis points and the average sale of B&G products per purchase grew by 25%.
We increased our marketing spending by approximately 20% for the year last year and over 50% in the fourth quarter to reinforce those gains and speak to all consumers about our brands that are driving growth.
Turning to a closer look at the fourth quarter, it would be easy to say that the business returned to a more normal footing with base business sales up just 2.5%.
The effect is easy to illustrate January 2020, excuse me 2021 base business sales were up 35%.
The year-over-year difference, accounting for roughly 5% of fourth quarter net sales.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was handicapped by $4.3 million in COVID related expenses that were not compensated for by increased sales and an additional spend of $4.5 million in marketing.
While we are still experiencing COVID related expenses, the rate of spending is trending downward and should not be near the $13.5 million cost, we saw in the last three quarters of 2020.
Despite that the limited launches, we managed to do in 2020 combined with incremental sales of 2019 new products accounted for roughly 2% of our net sales, or $45 million.
As we approach the threshold of $2 billion in net sales.
We are investing to foster more baking at home, in particular, very appropriate since approximately 19% of our sales are in brands that are involved in baking.
All of that leads us to estimate that we will have base business net sales that will exceed 2019 net sales by approximately 10%, with 11 months of Crisco net sales incremental to that.
We continue to believe that our shareholders are best served by the operating model that we have had in place since we went public in 2004.
This strategy has resulted in a net sales compound annual growth rate of 11% since our IPO in 2004 and an adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 11.9%.
Since our IPO, B&G Foods has paid out $1.73 billion in dividends.
On average over the years, dividends have represented approximately 60% of free cash flow.
In 2020, that payout ratio was about 54%, lower than normal due to the remarkable surge in operating results.
