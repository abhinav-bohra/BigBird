On a same-unit basis, total volume was up 1.3% versus the second quarter of 2019 with hospital-based services up by 10 basis points and office-based services up by 5.2%.
As a result, our revenue for the quarter of $473 million was above our internal expectations, as was our adjusted EBITDA of $66 million.
Looking forward beyond 2021 and count for the same risks, there are a number of factors that give me increased confidence that we'll see additional growth in adjusted EBITDA in 2022 that will get us pass the $270 million run rate we achieved pre-COVID.
Q2 is the first quarter where we can estimate the impact of these initiatives, and we think we've just begun by adding roughly $2 million to the top line in the quarter.
This group of 12 physicians and three nurse practitioners are among the premium groups of neurologists in the country.
These factors together support our confidence that in 2022 we can achieve adjusted EBITDA above the $270 million that I just referenced.
To put some statistics behind these two phenomena, I'll point out that compared to the second quarter of 2019 on a same-unit basis, volumes in our pediatric intensive care units were up 11.5% and pediatric hospitalist volumes were up 4%.
On the office space side, pediatric surgery volumes were up 8% and maternal-fetal medicine was up 9%.
Pediatric cardiology volume is still down slightly by 2%, but we anticipate that, that could increase as we move into the fall.
But we did incur a surge of IT-related spend in the second quarter to bring all of this over the finish line, which all sized, is roughly $3 million to $4 million over the year-over-year increase in our total G&A when compared to last year.
We received $25 million in cash proceeds and recorded a $7 million gain on the sale.
And on a go-forward basis, we'll realize approximately $2 million to $3 million in annual G&A savings from the building sale.
With all of these actions moving toward in our rearview mirror, we expect our dollar G&A spend for the second half of this year to be below $137 million we incurred during the first half.
We generated a strong $70 million in operating cash flow for the second quarter.
We ended up the quarter with $338 million in cash, up from $270 million at the end of the first quarter, and net debt of $662 million, implying leverage of less than three times.
In addition, you'll see on our balance sheet that we also have a $29 million income tax receivable primarily related to the tax elections made with respect to the sale of our Anesthesiology Medical group last year, and we anticipate receiving that cash sometime in late '21 or early '22.
Based on our expectations of second half adjusted EBITDA and cash flow, this tax receivable and normal uses of cash for capex and M&A, we would expect to end this year with leverage below 2.5 times.
