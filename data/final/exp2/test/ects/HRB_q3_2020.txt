Client survey scores increased 3 points for price for value and 2 points for overall quality, considering the 9 point improvement in these scores last season, these results are tremendous.
Collectively, these efforts have led to strong results in our net promoter scores increasing over 3 points.
This is a significant -- this is significant considering the 9 point increase we saw last year.
Since we have remedied the issue we have seen a 4% improvement in net average charge in DIY.
All of these improvements are fueling Wave's impressive performance which continued this quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of over 40%.
Starting with revenues, we saw a year-over-year growth of $51 million or 11% to $519 million.
This increase was primarily due to higher tax preparation fees due to volume growth in Assisted and DIY and the acquisition of just over 200 franchise offices this year which continues to be a good use of capital.
In addition to increases in our tax business, Wave contributed $11 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of more than 40%.
Total operating expenses increased $65 million or 11% to $672 million.
We also recorded $19 million of incremental marketing expense during the quarter that was entirely due to a pull forward of recognition from Q4 to Q3, and was not due to an increase in spend.
Interest expense was $26 million, which reflects an increase from the prior year due to higher draws on our line of credit.
The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an increase in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $18 million.
GAAP loss per share increased $0.08 to $0.66.
Adjusted loss per share increased $0.07 to $0.59 driven by the increase in pre-tax loss and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by an increased tax benefit.
We came into this year with a strong financial position after generating over $500 million of free cash flow in fiscal '19.
We've increased our quarterly dividend each of the last four years, resulting in a 30% increase over that time.
Regarding share repurchases in the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $66 million at an average price of $23.35.
Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $24.36.
Starting with the tax industry, we continue to expect overall return growth of around 1%, with Assisted volume flat to slightly up and DIY growing around 3%.
Consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we expect these client growth and net average charge expectations along with Wave to result in revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%.
This year, we realized approximately $15 million of unplanned one-time expenses -- one-time expense increases, due to legal cost and Refund Advance fees, which will also impact our margin.
Despite these expense increases, we continue to expect EBITDA margin to be within our previously provided range of 24% to 26%.
As we indicated last quarter, we expect the tax rate of 19% to 21% due to favorable settlements with tax authorities during the second quarter.
The rest of our financial outlook also remains unchanged with total depreciation and amortization of $165 million to $175 million, of which $70 million to $80 million will be amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions.
We continue to expect interest expense of $90 million to $100 million and capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million.
