Additional details on these and other topics are outlined in our COVID Insert, found on Pages 1 to 13 of our supplemental package.
Rental rate mark-to-market was almost 16% on a GAAP basis and 8% on a cash basis.
Our retention rate was 76% and we posted FFO of $0.35, which was in line with consensus.
Full details of those efforts are found on Page 9 of our SIP.
Bottom line, we've about 1.6% of our rents coming from retail tenants.
Normal monthly billings run about $500,000.
We received $150,000 in April.
29 tenants or 45% of leases have been or in the process of documenting rent deferrals.
About 2.1% of our rents come from co-working and conferencing tenants.
Normal monthly billings are $675,000.
During April we received $580,000.
For April, we received 95% of overall rents, 96% collection rate from our office tenants, and 100% collection rate from our Top 30 tenants.
We did, however, have the foresight to procure a $5 million of coverage sublimit for interruption by communicable diseases under our property policy, which we believe will be operative where we have force majeure majeure, such as in the case where you have hard head work stoppages due to government mandates.
In our 2020 plan, we're assuming that construction gets back to work in the next 30 days.
But the impact of this temporary work stoppage in our '20 plan is $2.3 million of GAAP NOI, 218,000 [Phonetic] square feet of lower occupancy, which reduces our year-end occupancy by 1.4%.
We also spend a significant amount of time looking at our leasing pipeline, which stands right now 1.3 million square feet.
Our leasing team and executive directors have been in extensive and repeated touch with every prospect and tenant rep of our 1.3 million square foot pipeline.
To the best we can determine as of today, we believe that about 52% of that pipeline or 670,000 square feet are deals that are progressing, but clearly with the shutdown, the execution timing is uncertain, but we would anticipate within the next 90 to 120 days.
We have about 45% of the deals in our pipeline on hold due to the virus.
Of that, based upon the information we have, we think that 10% of those will likely progress to execution, about 70%, it's just simply too early to tell as a lot of our prospects are focused on their own businesses versus their office space requirements and we believe about 15% is mostly likely dead requirements because of the virus and we expect to lose the balance of about 7% to another competitor.
And as Tom will walk through in more detail, we've done a thorough review of our expected spend for the balance of the year, and have reduced that spend by $50 million or about 20%.
More detail on that can be found on Page 11 of our SIP.
And primarily due to slower projected leasing and the impact of construction work stoppages, we're reducing our spec revenue target by $5 million to $26 million.
Our redevelopment project at 1676 International Drive in Northern Virginia experienced both of these conditions totaling almost 60% of this slide or $2.9 million.
Overall, leasing delays totaled about $2.7 million of GAAP revenue, and the previously mentioned work stoppage of $2.3 million accounts for the balance.
We're projecting to have between $400 million and $480 million available on our line of credit by the end of the year, that number depends on whether we refinance or pay off an $80 million mortgage securing one of our Philadelphia CBD properties.
We only have one $10 million mortgage maturing in 2021, no unsecured bond maturities until '23.
We generate $85 million of free cash flow after debt service and dividend payments, and that dividend is extremely well covered with a 54% FFO and a 70% CAD payout ratios.
And looking at our guidance, we set our new range at $1.37 to $1.45 per share.
To do a very quick reconciliation, our previous midpoint was a $1.46 per share.
We did increase and Tom will talk about during his conversation, our project reserves, which reduced that by $0.02.
We did a building sale that cost us $0.01.
Our office leasing slides are close to $0.02 a share, the construction slides will cost us $0.01.
We anticipate losing a $0.01 through our joint ventures and we anticipate losing another $0.01 through lost parking revenue, and the hotel component of our AKA project at the FMC tower.
The share buyback, which we also announced, added $0.03 back, so our new midpoint is $1.41.
First of all, on the development front, all four of our production assets, that is Garza, Four Points, 650, and 155 King of Prussia Road are all fully approved, all work is paid for.
As we have noted previously, each of these projects can be completed within four quarters to six quarters and cost between $40 million to $70 million.
And as such, you'll note in our revised business plan, where we have reduced our two projected 2020 starts down to one, which we achieved with the start of our 3000 Market Street project.
In looking at our existing development projects, at 405 Colorado, as we identified in our supplemental, we did have a disappointment post quarter close.
Our lead 70,000 square foot tenant terminated their lease pursuant to a one-time Right-to-Terminate, if we did not meet an interim milestone delivery date.
So that project now stands at 18% leased with 160,000 square feet to lease, and what we know will be a very exciting addition to Austin skyline.
This 64,000 square foot building is being fully converted into a life science facility.
And we're very fortunate to have recently signed a lease with a life science tenant, where they will take the entire building on a 12-year lease commencing in the third quarter of '21, and deliver a development yield of 8.5%.
On Broadmoor, we're advancing Block A, which is a combination of 360,000 square foot office building, and 340 apartments through final design and pricing.
On the investment front, we sold one property during the quarter for $18 million.
We also repurchased, net after dividends savings, $55 million of our own shares.
Those shares were purchased at a 10.5% cap rate and 8% dividend yield, and an imputed value of $203 per square foot.
As we assessed regardless of trading price of our stock, this was a good investment, delivering both immediate and better returns on our targeted developments, and was paid for via the asset sale and the capital spending reduction of $50 million.
To provide a frame of reference, the average cap rates in our markets on asset sales since the great financial crisis has been 6.4% and an average price per square foot of $350.
Both of those metrics more than supporting this investment, as well as when you compare that to current replacement costs between $400 and $600, it further amplifies the validity of making that investment in our own shares.
We came in at $7.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share.
FFO totaled $61.4 million or $0.35 per diluted share.
Operating expenses from lower G&A expense was a $1 million as compared to the forecast.
First quarter fixed charge and interest coverage ratios were 3.7% and 4%, respectively.
Consistent with prior years, our first quarter annualized net debt-to-EBITDA did increase as G&A increased to 6.7 times.
Looking at 2020 guidance, as Jerry outlined earlier, we're reducing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.05 per share.
The combined $5 million reduction in spec revenue is $0.03 per share.
In light of the increased economic concerns from our tenants, we increased our forecasted reserves by $0.02 per share.
The non-core asset sale in the first quarter also including the JV in the fourth quarter, which we didn't adjust guidance for, is about a $0.01 a share.
We anticipate similar leasing slides at MAP, our JV, where we're 50% owner, and some slides as well at 4040, which did open -- get its CO in February of this year.
In addition to that, we believe our parking and FMC operations will be negatively affected in the near-term, and we're putting a tiny share for that reduction, and then the reduction to partially offset that is the buyback which is $0.03 accretive.
Portfolio level operating expenses will total about $80 million.
This will be sequentially $3.3 million below the first quarter, primarily due to the $1.8 million increase in some operating expenses, its timing of R&M, $600,000 due to the loss GAAP income for the non-core asset sale that was there in the first quarter, not there in the second quarter, and $1 million due to March move out of SHI, Barton Skyway, and the lower hotel revenue that we expect to happen in AKA.
FFO contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures will total $2 million for the first [Phonetic] quarter, which is down $700,000, primarily do the MAP and bringing in 4040 online which will incur some initial start-up losses.
For the full year the FFO contribution is estimated to be $9.5 million.
G&A, our second quarter G&A expense will be $8.5 million, very similar to first quarter.
Full year G&A expense will total about $32 million.
Interest expense will be $21 million for the second quarter with 95.3% of our balance sheet debt being fixed rate.
Capitalized interest will approximate $1 million and full year interest expense is approximately $82 million.
Capitalized interest will continue to approximate $3.2 million for the year as we continue building 405 Colorado.
We extended our mortgage at Two Logan Square for an additional maturity date from May 1 to August 1.
That mortgage payoff is about $80 million at a 3.98% rate.
Termination, other income, we anticipate termination fee and other income to be $2.5 million for the second quarter and $11.5 million for the year.
Net management leasing and development fees, quarterly NOI will be $2 million, that will approximately $8 million for the quarter.
Our buyback activity as Jerry mentioned, we executed on a stock buyback in March of 2020, at excellent economic terms and then implied 8% cash dividend yield.
In addition, the weighted average share count for the year will be reduced to about $174 million, and for the second quarter will be roughly $172 million as our weighted average share count.
And we still have the only -- the building acquisition at 250 King of Prussia Road for roughly $20 million.
As outlined, we took a hard look at our capital spend and have reduced 2020 capital by $50 million.
While we reduced our earnings, we have saved on the capital for 1676.
The reduced development capital is based on only one development start and 3000 market being our only development start, and that will have just lower the amount of prospective capital we had on the other two development starts.
Based on above, our CAD range will remain at 71% to 78%, as the lower capital may be offset by deferred rent that will be repaid in 2020.
Uses are outlined as on Page 12.
We have $91 million of development capital, that's being spent.
We have common dividends of $97 million.
Revenue maintain of $36 million.
And then we have a $40 million of revenue create.
And then $6 million of mortgage amortization.
Loan pay off if we do it is $80 million and the acquisition of a King of Prussia Road.
Primary sources will be cash flow after interest of $182 million.
Line use of $150 million, which would bring us up to the $200 million we've projected, and cash on hand of a $33 million, and some land sales that we still expect to have happen later in the year.
Based on this capital plan, we would have $200 million outstanding on our line, or a $120 million if we refinance the mortgage.
We projected our net debt-to-EBITDA will range between 6.3 times and 6.5 times.
So it's a little higher than where it's been, where our range had previously been, 6.1 times to 6.3 times.
In addition, our debt to GAV will approximately be 43%.
As Jerry mentioned, we have a well-covered dividend, both from FFO and AFFO metric of 54% and 70%, respectively.
In addition, we anticipate our fixed charge ratio will continue to approximate 3.7 times and our interest coverage to approximate 4.1 times.
