As Meredith said, this is the highest rate of subscription revenue growth in well over a decade, with digital-only subscription revenue growing more than 30% to $190 million.
Digital-only subscription revenue grew as a result of the large number of new subscriptions we have added in the past year, continued strength and retention of the $1 per week promotional subscriptions who graduated to higher prices, and finally, the positive impact from our digital subscription price increase, which began late in the first quarter of 2020.

Total advertising revenues increased more than 66% in the quarter as digital advertising grew nearly 80%, while print advertising increased by 48%, largely as a result of the impact of the comparison to weak advertising revenues in the second quarter of 2020 caused by reduced advertising spending during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Versus 2019, digital advertising grew 22% as a result of higher direct sold advertising, including traditional display and audio.

Sales and marketing costs increased approximately 35%, driven primarily by higher media expenses, which has been reduced dramatically last year in light of the historically strong organic subscription demand experienced in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
When compared to 2019, sales and marketing costs decreased 14% as a result of lower advertising sales costs, partially attributable to a workforce reduction that we enacted in the second quarter of 2020, as well as lower media expenses.
Media expenses in 2021 was 14% lower than in 2019.
Product development costs increased by approximately 28%, largely due to growth in the number of engineers employed and a higher incentive compensation accrual than we had recorded in the second quarter of 2020.
