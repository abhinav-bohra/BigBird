This compares to adjusted operating earnings of $48 million for the LLY period exceeding our pre-pandemic performance by 85%.
We reported revenues of $629 million, 58% over last year and 8% below the LLY period.
For the quarter, we delivered that 14% adjusted operating margin.
We expanded our operating margin by over 700 basis points from 7% in the LLY period.
The star of this quarter was the North America Retail segment that reported an operating profit of $38 million versus $6 Million in the LLY period and almost 540% increase.
Some highlights include reaching gender pay parity, increasing our eco-smart Guess penetration to 20% and receiving approval in our ambitious science-based targets for greenhouse gas reductions.
We have increased our environmental quality score with the Independent shareholder services to a 1 out of 10, the highest rating possible, as a result of this work.
Our e-commerce business grew 11% in North America and Europe for the quarter versus last year.
We're also very pleased with our Americas Wholesale business, which grew 19% in sales and 54% in operating profit versus LLY.

In fact, this past weekend, we had a successful event with Babylon and influential skate and streetwear label on our campus in LA where we hosted over 6,000 people over three days.
For example, in Europe, we are seeing improved conversion rates, especially from mobile, which represents over 80% of our traffic.
Our average web session duration increased over 20%, bounce rate decreased 10% and loading time versus our previous platform is 70% faster.
And during the quarter, we implemented some upgrades to the platform resulting in an increase in our add to basket sessions of over 30%.
We laid out a plan to increase operating margin by about 450 basis points to 10% in five years.
We used the pandemic as an accelerator to transform our business and not only are we expecting to reach our 10% target this year, but we are now increasing our operating margin target to 12% by fiscal year 2024, when we plan to deliver $2.8 billion in revenue.
I'm excited to share with you that this would yield a return on invested capital of over 30%.
We announced today that our Board has authorized a share repurchase program of $200 million.
Second quarter revenues were $629 million, up 58% to last year in U.S. dollars and 51% in constant currency.
We were down 8% compared to LOI.
This was slightly short of our expectations, as a result of timing in our European wholesale business worth about 4% to LLY, where delays in product receipts moved some shipments a few weeks into the third quarter.
Overall, the 8% revenue decline to LLY was driven by the impact of permanent store closures worth roughly 5% of revenue and the shift in wholesale shipments in Europe.
In Americas Retail, revenues were down 6% versus LLY, better than our expectations.
This decline was entirely driven by permanent store closures, which were worth about 8% of the sales to LLY.
Store comps in the U.S. and Canada were up 5% in constant currency.
Operating margin in Q2 was 20% versus only 3% two years ago and operating profit is 6 times what it was in LLY even on lower sales.
In Europe, revenues were down 5% versus LLY.
Store comps for Europe were down 20% in constant currency, impacted by negative traffic; however, this was partially offset by solid conversion rates and significant AUR increases.
In Asia, revenue was down 43% to LLY, almost half of this decline was driven by permanent store closures.
Our store comps were down 30% in constant currency, with negative sales comps in South Korea and China, more moderate than other areas in the region like Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong, Macau, where they're struggling more with the pandemic.
Our Americas Wholesale sales were up 19% to LLY.
Operating margin expanded almost 600 basis points to LLY here, resulting in a lift of over 50% for operating profit in this segment.
Licensing revenues also outperformed and were up 18% to LLY in Q2 to provide strong performance in our perfume and footwear.
And as you know, this is an extremely high margin business, which delivered a 92% operating margin this quarter.
Total company gross margin for the quarter was 46.8%, almost 800 basis points higher than two years ago.
Our product margin increased 370 basis points this quarter versus LLY, primarily as a result of lower promotions and higher IMU.
Occupancy rate decreased 420 basis points.
This quarter we booked over $7 million in rent credits for fully negotiated rent release deals, mostly in Europe.
Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was $206 million, compared to $218 million two years ago, a decrease of $12 million or 6%.
In addition, there was a one-time benefit of about $4 million from government subsidies, namely in Europe, which was partially offset by higher variable expenses related to the growth of our e-commerce business.
Adjusted operating profit for the second quarter was $89 million versus $48 million in Q2 two years ago.
We ended the second quarter with $459 million in cash a $131 million higher than last year's balance at the end of Q2.
Inventories were $430 million, up 3% in U.S. dollars and 1% in constant currency versus last year.
Year-to-date capital expenditures were $22 million, up from $10 million in the prior year, but significantly below pre-pandemic levels.
We generated $18 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year.
We announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $200 million share repurchase program.
This new program includes the $48 million remaining under the Company's previously authorized repurchase program and we will use it opportunistically.
In terms of profit, adjusted operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be about 250 basis points better than LLY.
Gross margin is expected to expand by around 600 basis points to LLY, driven primarily by lower occupancy costs, lower promotions and improved IMU.
We anticipate that the adjusted SG&A rate will be at 350 basis points as cost savings are offset by business mix and reinvestments in business expansion initiatives including marketing.
We now expect operating margins to reach approximately 10% for the year versus adjusted operating margin of 5.6% in LLY.
This represents margin expansion of roughly 450 basis points to our pre-pandemic business despite a lower revenue base and we are confident in our ability to sustain these profitability levels, as well as deliver top line growth.
As a result, we are raising our operating margin target and our long-term plan to reach 12% by fiscal year 2024 with revenues in that year expected to hit $2.8 billion dollars, consistent with our previous call.
This implies an operating income of $335 million in fiscal year 2024, $185 million more than adjusted operating profit in fiscal year 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be around $3.50 per share, versus a $1.45 in fiscal year 2020.
