Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low cost oil development come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 a barrel by the middle of the decade.
In terms to preserving cash, at the end of March, we had [Technical Issues] billion cash on the balance sheet, a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which is undrawn and was recently extend by one year to 2024 and no debt maturities until 2023.
We've mainted a disciplined capital on exploatory budget for 2021 of $1.9 billon.
More than 80% of this year's capital spend is allocated to Guyana, where our three sanctioned oil developments have breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel.
And to The Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI.
To manage downside risk, in 2021 we have hedged a 120,000 barrels of oil per day with $55 per barrel WTI put options and 30,000 barrels of oil per day with $60 per barrel Brent put options.
In March, we entered into an agreement to sell our oil and gas interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million effective January 1, 2021.
On April 8, we announced the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in The Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million effective March 1, 2021.
During the quarter, we also received $70 million in net proceeds from the public offering of a small portion of our Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP.
In February, as WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig, which will allow us to sustain production and strong cash flow generation from our largest operated asset.
On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest, and ExxonMobil is the operator, we've made 18 significant discoveries to date, with gross discovered recoverable resources of approximately nine billion barrels of oil equvialent.
Yesterday, we announced the discovery of the Uaru-2 Well with encouraging results that further define the large aerial extent of this accumulation, underpinning a potential future oil development.
In addition, drilling activites are under way, for appraisal at the Longtail-3 Well and for exploration at the Koeb-1 prospect.
Production from phase 1 ran at its full capacity at 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day during the first quarter.
Production has since ramped back up and is expected to remain in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 gross barrels of oil per day until repairs to the discharge silencer are completed in approximately three months.
Following this repair, production is expected to return to or above Liza Destiny's nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day.
The Liza Phase-II development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block, at the Payara field, is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
We continue to see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs, on the block by 2027 and longer term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block.
We support the aim of the Paris agreement and also a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
In 2020 we significantly surpassed our five-year emission reduction targets, reducing the operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 40% and flaring intensity by approximately 60% compared to 2014 levels.
We recently announced our new five-year emission reduction targets for 2025 which are to reduce operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 levels.
Company wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance.
Bakken net production in the first quarter averaged 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Of this shortfall, approximately 8,000 barrels per day was due to the significant increase in NGL prices in the quarter.
The other fact that effected Bakken production in the quarter was related to winter storm Yuri, which brought power outages and average wind chill temperatures of minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit for two weeks in February.
In the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought four new wells online.
In the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and bring approximately 10 new wells online.
And for the full year 2021, we expect to drill approximately 55 wells and to bring approximately 45 new wells online.
For the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
And for the full year 2021, between 155,000 barrels and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
We expect net production to build in the second half of the year and forecast 2021 exit rate of between 170,000 barrels and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, first quarter net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operations following hurricane recovery in late 2020.
In the second quarter, we forecast that Gulf of Mexico net production will average approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
For the full year 2021, we maintain our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime and natural field declines.
In the Gulf of Thailand, net production in the first quarter was 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as natural gas nominations continue to increase due to strong economic growth.
Second quarter and full year 2021 net production are forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block are world-class in every respect and with Brent breakeven oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel represent some of the lowest project breakeven oil prices in the industry.
Production from Liza Phase-1 averaged 121,000 gross barrels of oil per day or 31,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess in the first quarter.
Production is currently averaging between 110,000 and 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day, and is expected to stay in that range while repairs are made to the silencer.
Upon reinstallation and restart of the flash gas compression system, expected in approximately three months, poduction is expected to return to or above nameplate -- nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day.
For the second quarter, we now forecast net production to average between 20,000 barrels and 25,000 barrels of oil per day.
And our full-year 2021 net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day.
I think it's important to note that the overall performance of the subsurface in Liza-1 has been outstanding.
At Liza Phase II, the project is progressing to plan with about 90% of the overall work completed and first oil remains on track for early 2022.
The Liza Unity FPSO with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day is preparing to sale from the Keppel yard in Singapore to Guyana mid year.
Our third development, Payara, is also progressing to plan with about 38% of the overall work completed.
The project will utilize the Liza Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
In terms of drilling activity, as announced yesterday, the Uaru-2 well successfully appraised the Uaru well discovery and also made an incremental discovery in deeper intervals [Phonetic].
The well encountered approximately 120ft of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled 6.8 miles from the discovery well, implying a potentially large areal extent.
The Stena Carron has commenced exploration drilling at the Koeb-1 well and an exploration well at Whiptail is planned to spud in May.
Further exploration and appraisal activities are planned for the second half of 2021 with a total of approximately 12 wells to be drilled this year.
Company wide second quarter net production is forecast to average between 290,000 barrels and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Full year 2021 net production is now also expected to average between 290,000 barrels and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our previous forecast of approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This reduction reflects the following: approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, due to lower entitlements, resulting from the increase in NGL strip prices.
Second factor is approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was related to the sale of our interest in Denmark and non-strategic acreage in North Dakota, for which we brought full value forward.
The balance primarily reflect short term weather effects in The Bakken, from which we expect to catch back up over the course of the year and again forecast a 2021 Bakken exit rate of between 170,000 barrels and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
We had net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $176 million, which excluded an after-tax gain of $79 million from an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 2020.
E&P had net income of $308 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $118 million in the previous quarter.
Higher realized crude oil, NGL, and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $192 million.
Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $99 million.
Lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $88 million.
Lower cash costs increased earnings by $39 million.
All other items increased earnings by $8 million for an overall increase in first quarter earnings of $426 million.
Excluding the two VLCC cargo sales, our E&P sales volumes were over lifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels, which improved after-tax results by approximately $10 million.
The sales from the two VLCC cargoes increased net income by approximately $70 million in the quarter.
The impact of higher NGL prices improved first quarter earnings by approximately $55 million and reduced Bakken NGL volumes received under percentage of proceeds or POP contracts by 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with the fourth quarter of 2020.
The Midstream segment had net income of $75 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $62 million in the prior quarter.
Midstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $225 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $198 million in the previous quarter.
In March Hess received net proceeds of $70 million from the public offering of 3,450,000 Hess owned Class A shares in Hess Midstream.
At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.86 billion and our total liquidity was $5.5 billion, including available committed credit facilities.
While debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion.
Our fully undrawn 3.5 billion revolving credit facility is now committed through May 2024 following the amendment executed earlier this month to extend the maturity date by one year.
In the first quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $815 million compared with $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher realized selling prices.
In the first quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $591 million compared with $486 million in the prior quarter.
The sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in The Bakken for total consideration of $312 million is expected to close within the next few weeks and the sale of our interest in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.
Our E&P cash costs were $9.81 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $10.21 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the first quarter of 2021.
We project E&P cash cost excluding Libya to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of maintenance and workover spend.
Full year E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is up from previous full year guidance of $10.50 to 11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, due to the impact of updated production guidance.
DD&A expense was $11.83 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya.
And $12.36 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the first quarter.
DD&A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $11.50 per barrel to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $12 per barrel to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged.
This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya to be in the range of $23.50 per barrel to $25.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter.
And $23 per barrel to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.
Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $170 million to $180 million is unchanged.
The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million for the second quarter.
And full-year guidance of $1.90 million to 1.115 million is unchanged.
E&P income tax expense excluding Libya is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the second quarter.
And $105 million to $115 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $80 million to $90 million due to higher commodity prices.
We expect non-cash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the second quarter and approximately $245 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $205 million, reflecting additional premiums paid to increase the strike price on our crude oil hedging contracts.
Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million in the second quarter, and the full year guidance of approximately $1.9 billion remains unchanged.
For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million for the second quarter and the full year guidance of $280 million to $290 million remains unchanged.
For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the second quarter, and full-year guidance of $130 to $140 million is unchanged.
Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the second quarter, and full-year guidance of $380 million to $390 million is unchanged.
