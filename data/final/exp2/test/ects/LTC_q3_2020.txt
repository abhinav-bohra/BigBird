Most recently, the government released Phase three of its CARES Act, which includes an additional $20 billion in funds earmarked to help cover lost revenue to healthcare providers.
While the quarter did not include significant new investments, our focus on structured finance opportunities resulted in us committing nearly $20 million in preferred equity, some of which has already been funded, and the remainder of which is expected to be funded in the fourth quarter.
We collected 94% of third quarter rent.
Excluding Senior Lifestyle, which I'll discuss in a moment, third quarter rent collected was 97%.
Another operator, not in our top 10, who has been a go-to operator for challenging properties and has historically performed well, has been adversely impacted by COVID-19 and began short paying rent in the third quarter and requested deferrals.
This closure required us to record a realization reserve of $941,000.
For the 2020 third quarter, we received rent payments of approximately $3.3 million against their quarterly contractual rent obligation to LTC of approximately $4.6 million.
At September 30, Senior Lifestyle owed us $3.8 million for second and third quarter rents, $2.5 million of which is recorded in our financial statements and is covered by an undrawn letter of credit, which we hold.
In October, we received rent of approximately $1.3 million against Senior Lifestyle's contractual rent obligation for the month of approximately $1.6 million.
Total revenue decreased $8.9 million compared with last year's third quarter, primarily resulting from the $5.5 million write-off that Wendy discussed, a result of transitioning two leases to cash basis accounting as of September 30, 2020.
During the quarter, we provided this operator with rent support in the form of deferrals and abatements totaling $756,000.
Interest income from mortgage loans increased $244,000 due to the funding of expansion and renovation projects.
Interest and other income decreased $535,000 due to the partial paydown of an outstanding mezzanine loan as well as a reduction in miscellaneous income.
Income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $704,000 in the third quarter due to the repayment of a mezzanine loan accounted for as a joint venture and the dissolution of our preferred equity investment in a joint venture with an affiliate of Senior Lifestyle, which occurred in the second quarter.
Interest expense decreased $466,000 due to lower outstanding balances and lower interest rates under our line of credit in 3Q 2020, partially offset by the sale of $100 million of senior unsecured notes in 4Q 2019.
Property tax expense decreased $919,000 due to Preferred Care property sales and our Senior Lifestyle portfolio, offset by increases related to acquisitions and completed development projects.
During the third quarter, we recorded a $941,000 impairment charge related to the closed assisted living property in Florida.
We also received $373,000 in insurance proceeds for roof damage related to a property we sold in the first quarter of this year.
Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2020 decreased $15 million primarily due to the straight-line rent write-offs and the decreased rent from Preferred Care and Senior Lifestyle that I discussed earlier.
Deferred and abated rent, the impairment charge, lower income from unconsolidated joint ventures and a $6.2 million gain on sale in last year's third quarter also contributed to the decline.
NAREIT FFO per fully diluted share was $0.58 for the 2020 third quarter compared with $0.77 last year.
Excluding the nonrecurring items already discussed in the current period, FFO per fully diluted share was $0.71 this quarter compared with $0.77 for last year's third quarter.
The $0.06 decrease in FFO, excluding nonrecurring items, resulted from lower revenues related to property sales, reduced rent from Senior Lifestyle, deferred and abated rent and lower income from unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by lower interest and property tax expense.
Funds available for distribution, excluding the $373,000 nonrecurring insurance proceeds gain, decreased $2 million due to Senior Lifestyle and deferred and abated rents in the third quarter of 2020.
During the third quarter, we invested $6.3 million of preferred equity to develop and own an assisted living and memory care community.
This investment earns an initial cash rate of 7%, increasing to 9% in year four until the IRR reaches 8%.
After achieving an 8% IRR, the cash rate drops to 8% with an IRR ranging between 12% and 14% depending on the timing of redemption.
We also entered into a preferred equity agreement to invest $13 million to develop and own an independent and assisted living community.
It will earn an initial cash rate of 8% and an IRR of 12%.
In the third quarter, we also funded $3.9 million in development and capital improvement projects on properties we own, $1.6 million under mortgage loans and paid $22.4 million in common dividends.
During the quarter, the development of our 90-bed skilled nursing center in Missouri was completed under budget by $1.3 million.
We anticipate funding the remaining $3.1 million of project costs in the 2020 fourth quarter.
The initial yield on our investment is 9.25%, escalating annually by 2%.
We currently have remaining commitments under mortgage loans of $2.3 million related to expansions and renovations on four properties in Michigan.
We received $2.6 million in the 2020 third quarter related to the partial paydown of an outstanding mezzanine loan.
At September 30, we had $22.8 million in cash.
We also had more than $510 million available under our line of credit and $200 million under our ATM program, providing LTC with ample liquidity of approximately $733 million.
At the end of the 2020 third quarter, our credit metrics compared favorably to the healthcare REIT industry average, with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA for real estate of 4.6 times, an annualized adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times and a debt to enterprise value of 32.9%.
The effect of the economic fallout from COVID-19 on the real estate capital markets has resulted in our debt to enterprise leverage metric being higher than our long-term target of 30%.
However, at 4.6 times, we are still comfortably below our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA for real estate target of below five times.
As Wendy mentioned, we collected 94% of third quarter rent.
Of the rent not collected, $690,000 related to rent abatements, $326,000 related to rent deferrals and $1.3 million related to delinquent rent from Senior Lifestyle.
During the second and third quarters of 2020, rent deferrals and abatements totaled approximately $1.4 million, net of $502,000 in deferred rent repayments or 1.8% of contractual rent for the period.
In October, rent deferrals were $566,000.
Abatements were $120,000, and delinquent rent was $264,000.
Additionally, we received deferred rent repayments of $51,000 in October.
As a reminder, our rent deferral agreements generally require the deferred rent to be paid within six to 24 months.
I'd like to start today with our two recent investment commitments totaling nearly $20 million.
First, as Pam mentioned, we invested $6.3 million in preferred equity in an entity that will develop and own a 95-unit assisted living and memory care community in Arlington, Washington, a suburb in Seattle.
LTC's investment represents approximately 15.5% of the total $40.8 million estimated project cost.
The second transaction is a $13 million preferred equity commitment Pam discussed.
Located in Vancouver, Washington, University Village at Salmon Creek is an independent living and assisted living community with a total of 267 units being developed by Koelsch Communities, the current operating partner.
LTC's initial investment represents approximately 11.6% of the total $112.3 million estimated project cost.
At October 23, occupancy was 10%.
As a reminder, this community includes 78 assisted living and memory care units.
On October 23, occupancy was 23%.
For one of these operators, we have provided two months of deferred rent totaling $280,000 or $140,000 in December and $140,000 in the first quarter of next year.
For the second, we have provided abated rent for November and December in the amount of $120,000 per month, which is 50% of contractual rents.
This operator's rent obligation is approximately $430,000 per month.
Q2 trailing 12-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage using a 5% management fee was 1.27 times and 1.06 times, respectively, for our assisted living portfolio.
Excluding Senior Lifestyle from our assisted living portfolio, EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages would increase to 1.41 times and 1.18 times.
For our skilled nursing portfolio, EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage was 1.85 times and 1.38 times, respectively, including stimulus payments made available through distribution of the provider relief fund allocated and reported to us by our operators but specifically excluding PPP funds.
If those stimulus payments are excluded, EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage was 1.64 times and 1.19 times, respectively.
Because our partners have provided October data to us on a voluntary and expedited basis before the month is closed, information we are providing includes approximately 71% of of our total private pay units and approximately 88% of our skilled nursing beds.
Private pay occupancy was 78% at June 30, 77% at September 30 and 76% at October 16.
For skilled nursing, our average monthly occupancy for the same time period, respectively, was 72%, 70% and 70%.
We represent 10,500 skilled nursing facilities, almost 70% of them across the country, and another 4,000 assisted living buildings.
On the clinical side, we have never faced a virus or a disease process that killed 15% to 20% of our residents who become affected that infected literally hundreds of thousands of people, many of them living in long-term care facilities.
Some of the first things that happened, for example, was a lifting of the federal sequester, the 2% cut that facilities, all providers incurred about eight or so years ago.
That 2% cut was taken away through the end of this calendar year.
And in a normal year, that would be a big deal, but in a pandemic year, 2% really is not a material number.
They only have the authority to declare it for 90 days at a time.
We received that news on May 1, and that rule has now been finalized, which means that there's been another 2.3% increase in Medicare payments, but probably more important than the increase is the fact that PDPM was not adjusted.
And we are optimistic that we'll be able to get it extended another 90 days to April 22 as we approach 2021.
The most significant lobbying victory we had actually wasn't any specific grant of money, it's when we were able to convince Congress in the first stimulus bill that the so-called $100 billion hospital fund shouldn't just be for hospitals, it should be for all providers.
And the subsequent success has been a multiple rounds of money out of that CARES act for skilled nursing facilities, now totaling over $12 billion.
Next week, for example, on Monday, will be the first payment of $2 billion in additional payments that are being paid out to providers who are particularly successful in keeping COVID out of their buildings.
When you add up all of these things that have occurred for skilled nursing facilities, whether it's the FMAP Medicaid money, the sequester, the CARES Act funding, the three-day stay waiver, you add it all up, and we believe that there's been over $20 billion in relief to the skilled nursing sector.
They have experienced a loss greater than the national average of 10% or so.
When HHS was given the assignment to pass out what ended up being $175 billion in funds, it started working with the groups and the providers that it was used to working with, which did not include assisted living.
It wasn't until September seven that the first funds went out to assisted living when the decision was made that both for folks that take Medicaid waiver and for straight pure private pay AL, they will all receive 2% of their 2019 revenue.
And they're trying to figure out how to hand out an additional $20 billion.
The conventional view in D.C., and I agree with it, is that there is a 100% chance that there will be another stimulus go.
If Republicans retain one part of the apparatus, whether it's the presidency or the Senate, the stimulus bill is very likely to be of the size that was being discussed when the discussions fell apart this week, somewhere around $1.8 trillion to $2.2 trillion.
But whenever there is a stimulus bill, if the Democrats take over, it will be larger than the $1.8 trillion to $2.2 trillion.
It will be more like the $3 trillion bill that they passed back in August, and that may just be the beginning.
The good news on census is that although it initially declined about 10% on the skilled nursing side, it hasn't collapsed any further.
If once we get to a vaccine, we can start rebuilding census 0.5% or 1% a month, the numbers work out.
We went through this demographic trough in the 2010s, where the number of people between 80 and 85 really wasn't increasing in the U.S. Well, we're past that now.
