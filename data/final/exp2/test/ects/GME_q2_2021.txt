We also continued to expand our fulfillment network by adding a 530,000-square-foot facility in Reno, Nevada.
Our new 700,000-square-foot facility in York, Pennsylvania also began shipping orders during the quarter.
We signed a lease on a new customer care facility in South Florida and started adding talent to that team as we continue to build out customer care operation in the U.S. Lastly, we further strengthened our balance sheet and capital position by raising more than $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the June ATM program.
Net sales increased 25.6% to $1.183 billion, compared to $942 million during the same period in 2020.
We achieved this growth while overcoming a roughly 9% reduction in our global store fleet due to de-densification efforts and ongoing store closures across certain international markets due to the pandemic.
SG&A was $378.9 million, or 32% of sales, compared to $348.2 million, or 37% of sales, in last year's second quarter.
Adjusting for severance and certain other costs, our adjusted SG&A was $372.3 million, or 31.5% of sales, compared to $336.9 million, or 35.8% of sales, during the same period last year.
The 430 basis points of leverage was primarily driven by store reopening after widespread shutdowns due to the pandemic in Q2 2020.
We reported a net loss of $61.6 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $111.3 million, or loss per diluted share of $1.71, in the prior-year second quarter.
Our adjusted net loss was $55 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $92 million, or a loss of $1.42 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2020 second quarter.
Our global store count was 4,642 at the end of the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and restricted cash of $1.775 billion, which is just over $1 billion higher than the end of the second quarter last year.
As we announced in June, we raised approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds through the issuance of 5 million shares of common stock under an ATM.
As a result of the ATM, total shares outstanding are now approximately 75.9 million.
At the end of the quarter, we had no borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility and no long-term debt other than a $47.5 million low-interest unsecured term loan associated with the French government's response to COVID-19.
Debt levels compared to the second quarter of last year were down $424.7 million.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.5 million, bringing year-to-date capex investments to 28.2 million, a number we anticipate will increase as the company continues investing in growth initiatives.
In the second quarter, cash flow from operations was an outflow of $11.5 million, compared to an inflow of $192.8 million during the same period last year, largely due to the investments in inventory we are making to drive sales growth.
