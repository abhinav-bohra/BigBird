The U.S. drilling rig count in the third quarter was down over 70% from the previous year and 35% from the second quarter 2020 to the lowest levels on record.
Despite this collapse, Forum was able to limit our revenue decline to just 9% sequentially as our revenue from outside North America was up 14%.
We began to see an increase in our orders in the latter part of Q3, resulting in an 8% sequential increase in our bookings in the third quarter.
Our cash costs, excluding our materials costs, are down almost 50% over this period as we have significantly reduced our overhead expense.
At the end of the third quarter, we had $129 million of liquidity.
Subsequent to the third quarter, we issued a call notice to redeem the remaining $13 million of 2021 notes.
In addition, we announced a 1-for-20 reverse stock split, and we'll begin trading next Tuesday, November 10, at the new ratio and higher stock price.
Since the beginning of 2019, we have reduced annualized cash costs by over $180 million, nearly 50%.
These reductions include $23 million in the third quarter alone.
Because of these cost reductions, EBITDA increased $2 million in the quarter despite a $10 million reduction in revenue.
We believe with our leaner cost structure following these reductions, we can achieve breakeven EBITDA at levels of industry activity of about 325 working rigs in the U.S.
Net loss for the quarter was $22 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.
Excluding a $29 million gain on extinguishment of debt, $12 million of special items and $3 million of foreign exchange losses, adjusted net loss was $0.30 per diluted share.
Our free cash flow after net capital expenditure in the third quarter was $6 million.
We benefited from the receipt of $14 million of tax loss carryback allowed under the CARES Act, which was partially offset by $9 million of cash interest paid in the quarter.
Proceeds from the disposition of certain capital assets, net of capital expenditures, generated $2 million of cash in the third quarter.
Excluding the tax benefit, we generated $12 million from decreases in our net working capital and expect reduction of working capital to continue.
Interest expense was $8 million in the third quarter, and depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation were $12 million and $2 million, respectively.
Adjusted corporate expenses were $5 million in the third quarter, and we expect them to be up modestly in the fourth quarter.
The face of our balance sheet shows a $122 million sequential decrease in long-term debt, comprised of the full repayment of $85 million of ABL credit facility borrowings and a $37 million reduction related to our debt exchange.
The $37 million is comprised primarily of a $33 million debt discount and additional decreases related to debt issuance costs.
The debt discount reflects the fair value discount on the 2025 notes under the accounting rules for debt extinguishments where we recorded the new debt at an estimated 90% of par.
For clarity purposes, the difference between the $33 million debt discount and the $29 million gain on extinguishment of debt recorded in the income statement relates to $3.5 million of early participation payments made to bondholders during the debt exchange.
The 35% sequential decrease in drilling activity in the U.S. had a meaningful impact on our Drilling & Downhole segment as demand for drilling rig components and well construction casing hardware was significantly impacted.
However, we are already seeing green shoots of activity in these product offerings as drilling rig count has increased by about 50 rigs after bottoming in August.
Demand for these products is more tied to well completion activity, and we saw a 30% increase in revenue for these products in the quarter.
In fact, about 50% of our sales go into older producing wells.
As Chris and Lyle have mentioned in their remarks, our cash costs have been reduced by nearly 50% since last year.
However, in an environment where U.S. drilling rig count is expected to average between 300 and 400 units next year, more costs need to be taken out of the business.
These actions are currently expected to be completed by early 2021 and will eliminate an additional $20 million to $30 million of annual expenses.
We expect our Q4 revenue to be at least as high as the $113 million generated in Q2, and we also expect our sequential incremental EBITDA margins to exceed 35%.
