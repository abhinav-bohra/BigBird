In sensors, we saw 20% organic growth, driven primarily by auto applications and we also saw growth in the commercial transportation and industrial applications as well.
For the segment, adjusted operating margins expanded sequentially to 19.4% on essentially flat sales.
And in this segment, sales increased 13% organically year-over-year.
In our industrial equipment business, sales were up 36% organically with growth in all regions and benefiting from the momentum in factory automation applications where we continue to benefit from accelerating capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor and automotive manufacturing.
Our AD&M business, sales declined 7% organically, driven by the continued weakness in the commercial aerospace market.
In our energy business, we saw 9% organic growth driven by increases in renewables, especially global solar applications.
And lastly, in our medical business as I mentioned earlier, a return to growth in the quarter and was up 10% organically year-over-year with the recovery in interventional procedures around the world.
From a margin perspective, adjusted operating margin for the segment expanded year-over-year by nearly 300 basis points to 15.8% despite the volume declines in our AD&M business.
