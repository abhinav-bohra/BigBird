In TAVR, despite headwinds, more than 100,000 patients benefited from treatment with SAPIEN valves worldwide.
And in Critical Care, we met the increased demand for core pressure monitoring products due to the pandemic, and we're proud that we were able to help over 1 million patients globally with our monitoring technology.
During the year when job losses impacted many families across the globe, Edwards prioritized protecting our employees and we grew our team to 15,000 worldwide.
We continue to make strategic R&D investments that enabled us to fuel progress and despite this unique environment and extraordinary prior year growth, underlying sales grew 1% in 2020 to $4.4 billion, which is a reflection of the life-threatening needs of the patients that Edwards serves.
As we indicated at our investor conference, we expect full year sales between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion representing mid-teens underlying growth on a year-over-year basis.
Now turning to our quarterly results, consistent with our guidance at our investor conference last month, fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion were in line with the year ago period when Edwards' grew nearly 20% on an underlying basis, reflecting the strength, even during the ongoing pandemic.
Full-year 2020 global sales -- global TAVR sales of 2.9 billion increased 4% on an underlying basis over the prior year.
In the fourth quarter, global TAVR sales were $776 million, up slightly from the year ago period.
Although the rollout was somewhat impacted, SAPIEN 3 Ultra now represents more than two-thirds of our global TAVR sales and physician feedback on ease of use and improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding.
Recall that our U.S. TAVR sales in the year ago period increased nearly 40% driven by the strong PARTNER 3 evidence that led to a third quarter 2019 indication expansion and improved patient access under an updated TAVR NCD.
In Japan, we continue to anticipate providing SAPIEN 3 for low-risk patients prior to the end of this year.
AHA noticed that if left untreated, the condition worsens and patients with severe aortic stenosis have a survival rate as low as 50% at two years.
Aortic stenosis is also a risk factor for heart failure, a costly disease projected the cost the US Healthcare System $70 billion in 2030.
In summary, we continue to anticipate 2021 underlying TAVR sales growth in the 15% to 20% range, as we shared at our Investor Conference.
We remain confident in this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range.
Turning to Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies or TMTT, we've made meaningful progress moving from early stage development to clinical use across all of our platforms with over 3,000 patients treated to-date.
Fourth quarter global sales were $13 million, representing sequential improvement versus Q3.
Full year 2020 sales were $42 million.
We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach $3 billion by 2025 with significant growth beyond.
In Surgical Structural Heart, full-year 2020 global sales of $762 million decreased 10% on an underlying basis over the prior year, in line of our guidance, with our guidance of 5% to 15% decline.
Fourth quarter sales of $204 million held steady with Q3 and declined 2% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was below our previous expectation for positive growth.
We believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structural Heart opportunity will grow mid single digits through 2026.
In Critical Care, full year 2020 global sales of $725 million decreased 3% on an underlying basis versus the prior year, in line with our guidance of flat to down 5%.
Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $198 million decreased 2% on an underlying basis, driven by the decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S., as hospitals limited their capital spending.
Sales in the fourth quarter were flat year-over-year on an underlying basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 2% to $0.50 versus the prior year.
GAAP earnings per share was similar at $0.49.
For the full year 2020, sales increased 1% on an underlying basis to $4.4 billion, adjusted earnings per share was flat at $1.86 and we generated over $700 million of adjusted free cash flow.
For the fourth quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.3% compared to 75.8% in the same period last year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $339 million or 28.4% of sales, compared to $347 million in the prior year.
We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items to be 28% to 29%, which is similar to pre-COVID levels.
Research and development expenses in the quarter grew 1% to $196 million or 16.4% of sales.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT including enrolling seven clinical trials.
Turning to taxes, our reported tax rate this quarter was 13.1% or 13.9% excluding the impact of special items.
This rate included a 350 basis point benefit from the accounting for stock-based compensation.
Our full-year 2020 tax rate, excluding special items was 12.5%.
We continue to expect our full year rate in 2021 excluding special items to be between 11% and 15%, including an estimated benefit of 5 percentage points from stock based compensation accounting.
Foreign exchange rates increased fourth quarter reported sales growth by 150 basis points or $18 million compared to the prior year.
At current rates, we now expect an approximate $100 million positive impact or about 2% to full year 2021 sales compared to 2020.
FX rates negatively impacted our fourth quarter gross profit margin by 150 basis points compared to the prior year.
Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $287 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $400 million, less capital spending of $113 million.
Now turning to the balance sheet, we have a strong balance sheet with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and investments as of the end of the year.
In addition, we have an undrawn line of credit of up to $1 billion.

For total Edwards, we expect sales of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion.
For TAVR, we expect sales of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion.
For TMTT, we expect sales of approximately $80 million.
We expect Surgical Structural Heart sales of $800 million to $900 million and Critical Care sales of $725 million to $800 million.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $2 to $2.20.
For the first quarter of 2021, we project total sales to be between $1.1billion and $1.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.50.
