And we have been working with retailers around the world to take limited amount of products into new channels, and we closed the year ahead of our objective of $50 million in B2B revenue, which is product sales sold through retails in their loyalty programs.
We ended the year up 1% of revenue and more than 50% on adjusted income.
The new report includes first-time social and governance goals, a new established 2025 and 2030 environmental target, including 90% absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
And last month, we renewed our partnership with the National Park Foundation, providing $2 million multi-use donation to create meaningful impact across the National Park system.
When we started the turnaround plan, we had 18 markets that we're losing money.
By converting these markets to a more omnichannel approach, this 18 formerly struggling markets now represent over $180 million in revenue and are contributing over 14% operating profit return on sales.
At the end of 2021, revenue from importers was almost $70 million, up 12% from last year.
Our retail studio market, excluding China, grew 19% in 2021, while our B2B loyalty programs achieved $56 million revenue, over 50% higher than last year.
In 2021, we continue to create the foundation for transforming a business that has been a pure direct selling business for more than 75 years.
For the full year 2021, we posted revenue of $1.6 billion, which represents an increase of 1% compared to 2020.
We also grew in three of our four regions for the full year, with Europe up 2%; North America, up 6%; South America, up 20%; and APAC was down 11%, mainly due to China.
Business expansion, which includes B2B loyalty programs, importers, studios, and retail, is now approximately 20% of our revenue.
We're pleased to report that the B2B loyalty revenue was $56 million for the year, exceeding our stated goal of $50 million for 2021 and $37 million in 2020.
For the year, three of our big four markets posted growth with the U.S. and Canada up 2%; Brazil up 9%; and Mexico higher than last year by 13%.
China was the only big four market that did not grow and was down by 21%, heavily impacted by fewer studio openings, impacts of lockdowns due to COVID and leadership changes throughout the year.
For the year, gross profit was $1.1 billion, flat compared with last year.
However, gross margin was 66.7%, as compared to 67.5% last year.
The decrease of 80 basis points was driven primarily by higher resin cost of 200 basis points, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies in the first half of the year.
Adjusted EBITDA was $290 million or 18.1% of sales, relatively flat on a reported basis.
Adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, as compared to $2.15 last year as reported.
In 2021, we had two favorable one-time items for the year: $0.15 related to a favorable ruling from the court in regard to a Brazil non-income tax matter; and $0.05 for a China grant, which are being partially offset by a deferred tax asset adjustment of $0.10 that we'll talk about in a minute.
Adjusted for these one-time items and for tax items in both periods, adjusted earnings per share was $3.15 for 2021, compared to $3.33 for 2020.
The decrease was primarily driven by higher resin cost of $0.47; investments, $0.24; partially offset by $0.53 of favorable manufacturing efficiencies, tighter cost controls, and lower interest.
The operating tax rate was 21.9% versus 45.5% in 2020.
As we noted in prior calls, we made significant investments in 2021 to accelerate our tax strategies in an effort to achieve our goal of sub-30%, aligned with our peers and our global operating structure.
For the fourth quarter, net sales were $395 million, representing a decrease of 10% compared to last year.
Excluding the COVID impact, net sales would have decreased 2% in the quarter.
Also coming off a strong second half of 2020, we were facing tougher comps in Q4, particularly in the U.S., due to over $25 million of backlog from previous quarters being shipped in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
On a two-year stack, fourth-quarter revenue increased by 6%.
Q4 was the strongest quarter for B2B loyalty program revenue, with $20 million of the full year $56 million and representing an increase of $15 million compared to the same quarter last year.
First, in Asia Pacific, sales decreased by 10%.
The slowdown in China, which was down 14% in the quarter, was driven by COVID lockdowns related to resurgence challenges as well as studio closings and a slower pace of new openings, partially offset by the successful entry into small kitchen appliances in this market.
Excluding China, the remainder of the Asia Pacific region was down 9% in the quarter, as we saw continued impact from lockdowns driven by the pandemic in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which significantly impacted sales efforts, particularly as digital adoption is low in many of these markets.
Excluding the impact of COVID, sales in the Asia Pacific region would have decreased by 2%.
In Europe, sales decreased by 7%.
While sales were lower overall, $13 million of the $20 million B2B in the quarter was in this market at significantly higher profit margins.
Excluding the impact of COVID, sales in Europe would have decreased by 3%.
In North America, sales decreased by 12% in the quarter, with the U.S. and Canada decreasing by 29%.
Adjusting for this, sales in the U.S. and Canada would have increased by 11%.
Sales in Mexico increased by 22% in the quarter, 5% from B2B, while the direct selling growth was driven by higher engagement and productivity due largely to the implementation of our proven direct selling methods, segmenting our sales force and sharing best practices as well as returning to in-person events during November and December as lockdowns were lifted in this market.
In South America, sales decreased by 10%.
Sales in Brazil were down by 21% driven by challenging economic conditions, including household debt levels and the expiration of the government stimulus in October, all of which contributed to lower levels of recruitment and productivity.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $241 million or 61% of net sales, a decrease of approximately 740 basis points compared to last year, largely driven by inflationary pressures.
Of the total, approximately 250 basis points was due to higher resin costs, with the balance being a mix of downtime and manufacturing inefficiencies due to lower volume and higher inventories, higher inventory reserves and market and product mix.
Our SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was 52.3% versus last year of 52.1%.
In the quarter, we made approximately $6 million of strategic investments, including information technology, new talent for products, sourcing, and business expansion to support future growth and the tax investments to achieve a sub-30s tax rate.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $47 million or 12% of sales, reflecting the higher resin cost and investments just discussed.
Our fourth-quarter operating tax rate was 40% versus over 80% in the same quarter in 2020.
As I stated earlier, on a full-year basis, our operating tax rate was 21.9%, so as you can see, we've made great progress toward our goal of sustainably lowering our tax rate and achieving our goal of sub-30s.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.38 in the quarter, compared to $0.22 last year.
Adjusting both years for the tax impacts, adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.49 per share versus $0.89 per share in 2020.
In 2021, higher cost related to resin, manufacturing inefficiencies and higher inventory reserves resulted in a negative impact of $0.27, while lower profit on reduced sales was $0.12.
On a reported basis, for the full year, operating cash flow net of investing was $130 million, compared to $198 million last year.
We ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $267 million, which compares to $134 million last year, and we ended the quarter with a total debt balance of $712 million.
At year end, our consolidated net leverage ratio was 2.1 times, well below both historical levels and our required covenant of 3.75 times.
Our new $880 million credit facility consists of a five-year $480 million revolving credit facility, a five-year U.S. dollar term loan of $200 million and a euro term loan of EUR 176 million.
The entire facility extends maturity out by two and a half years to 2026, increases liquidity by approximately $100 million through a higher level of revolver capacity and reduces the interest rate on our term loan by more than six percentage points.
In addition, the new facility resets our financial covenants to enhance operating flexibility, including capital allocation flexibility and leverage ratio calculation on a net basis, allowing for up to $100 million of cash to be applied toward debt balances.
We are also pleased to have the support of a new lead bank and banking syndicate, which is comprised of 10 banks and led by Wells Fargo.
We are also pleased and have made significant progress over the past 18 months in strengthening our balance sheet, refinancing our debt, investing in our business and selling our non-core assets.
In June of 2021, our board authorized a $250 million share repurchase program.
And in the third quarter of 2021, we returned $25 million to our shareholders under this program through stock buybacks.
This $25 million was the maximum amount of share repurchase allowable under our prior credit facility covenants.
We previously shared that at a quarterly run rate of $470 million of revenue and a tax rate of 28%, we believe we could sustainably deliver quarterly adjusted earnings per share of approximately $1 to $1.20.
If we adjust that range to reflect continuing operations only, we believe a reasonable quarterly range to be approximately $0.85 to $1, which assumes a tax rate in the mid- to upper 20s.
As we move into the expansion stage of our turnaround plan, which will require further investments and given the persisting uncertainty of the pandemic, we believe that for 2022, adjusted earnings per share will be approximately $0.65 to $0.80 per quarter, reflecting $0.05 to $0.20 per share per quarter lower than the normalized estimate.
We had originally shared that normalized annual free cash, which we define as operating cash flow net of investing cash flow, to be approximately $200 million.
Adjusting for discontinued operations, that normalized number now moves to a range of roughly $140 million to $160 million on a continuing operations basis.
For 2022, we anticipate a similar range of between $125 million and $150 million given anticipated investments into the business for our turnaround plan.
