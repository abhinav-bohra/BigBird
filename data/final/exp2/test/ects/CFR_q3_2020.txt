The total of these portfolio segments, excluding PPP loans, represented $1.54 billion at the end of the third quarter, and our loan loss reserve for these segments was 3.37%.

Our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter was 2.95%, down 18 basis points from the 3.13% reported last quarter.
The decrease primarily resulted from lower yields on loans, which had a negative impact of approximately 11 basis points on the net interest margin and a lower yield on securities, which had a three basis point negative impact, combined with an increase in the proportion of balances at the Fed as a percentage of earning assets, which had about a seven basis point negative impact on the NIM compared to the previous quarter.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the third quarter was 3.73%, down 22 basis points from the previous quarter.
The decrease in yield was impacted by decreases in LIBOR during the quarter, as about 2/3 of our loan portfolio, excluding PPP, is made up of floating rate loans, and about 60% of our floating rate loans are tied to LIBOR.
During the third quarter, we extended the expected term of the PPP portfolio somewhat, which resulted in a yield on the PPP portfolio of 3.65% during the third quarter as compared to 4.13% in the second quarter.

The yield on that portfolio, which averaged $4.2 billion during the quarter, was down 19 basis points from the second quarter to 2.21%, as a result of higher premium amortization associated with our agency MBS securities, given faster prepayment speeds and lower yields associated with recent purchases.
Our municipal portfolio averaged about $8.5 billion during the third quarter, flat with the second quarter, with a taxable equivalent yield of 4.08%, up one basis point from the prior quarter.

Looking at the full year 2020, our previous guidance on expenses was that adding back the deferred expenses related to PPP loans, we expected an annual expense growth of something around 6%.
Our current expectations would reduce that to something around the 3% range.
