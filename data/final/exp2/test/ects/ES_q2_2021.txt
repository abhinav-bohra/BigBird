During hearings spring [Phonetic] resulted in Rhode Island Coastal Resource Management Council approval of the project, we indicated that we would install 12 11-megawatt turbines in connection with this project.
We are making progress on the 2 larger projects as well.
In April, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board issued a preliminary decision in order and Revolution Wind schedule with advisory opinions for local and state agencies to be submitted by August 26, 2021.
It is also consistent with the administration's target of having 30,000MW of offshore wind operating in the United States by 2030.
On July 14, PURA took major -- took a major step forward in furthering the state's clean energy goals when it approved a comprehensive program to support the state's push for having at least 125,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by the end of 2025.
As you can see on the slide, by the end of this year, we will have invested $55 million in our Massachusetts Electric Vehicle program helping to connect about 4,000 charge ports.
However since transportation is responsible for more than 40% of the states' greenhouse gas emissions, significantly more support is needed to help the state beat its targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and 70% by 2040.
Massachusetts had only 36,000 electric vehicles registered as of January 1, 2021 and in 2020, only 3% of the light duty vehicle sold in the state where EVs.
While that percentages above average for the country as a whole, it needs to be enhanced significantly going forward since at the current pace, we will have fewer than 500,000 EVs in Massachusetts, as of 2030.
We need more than 1 million EVs by then for the state to reach its targets.
We have proposed spending more than $190 million on EV support from 2022 to 2025, including $68 million of capital investment.
We're also pleased to share updates on our 20:30 carbon neutrality goal, including our first third party verification of our 20-20 greenhouse gas footprint.
We have a number of teams within Eversource cast with making our 2030 goal a reality.
They include a team focusing on reducing emissions in 5 principal areas.
Another team working on developing the strategy to offset emissions that cannot be eliminated by 2030 and another team that's encouraging all 9,300 Eversource employees to contribute to their best ideas on how we could achieve our 2030 goal.
We are in $0.77 per share for the quarter, including $0.02 per share of costs primarily relating to the transitioning of Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts into the Eversource systems.
Excluding these costs, we earned $0.79 per share in the second quarter and $1.87 per share in the first half of 2021.
Our Electric Transmission business earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2020, a higher level of necessary investment in our transmission facilities was partially offset by higher share count there.
Our Electric Distribution business earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared with earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
Our Natural Gas Distribution business earned $0.01 per share in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020.
Our Water Distribution business Aquarion earned $0.03 per share in the second quarters of both 2021 and 2020.
Beginning next year, we expect Aquarion revenues to be bolstered by previously announced acquisition of New England Service Company or any SC owns the number of small water utilities that serve approximately 10,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
We continue to expect ongoing earnings toward the lower end of our $3.81 to $3.93 per share guidance.
This incorporates $28.6 million pre-tax charge relating to our performance in Connecticut, following the devastating impact of tropical storm Isaias last summer.
We also continue to project long-term earnings per share growth in the upper half of the range of the 5% to 7% through 2025 excluding the impact of our new offshore wind projects.
I mentioned earlier that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or PURA has finalized the $28.6 million civil penalty associated with our storm performance last summer that follow the April 28 release of a final storm performance decision that we discussed on our first quarter call.
The April 28 storm order also required a 90 basis point reduction in Connecticut Light and Powers distribution ROE on top of the $28.6 million penalty.
A supplemental hearing is scheduled for August 9, at which time additional testimonial evidence may be presented on certain issues including the applicability in term of the 90 basis point penalty.
Pure justice Week notified parties that written testimony on the applicability in term of that penalty may be filed in advance of the August 9 hearing, no later than August 4.
CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021 was 8.86% and its authorized distribution return was 9.25%.
Regardless of the status of this rate review, we and our regulators share a common goal of providing nearly 1.3 million Connecticut electric customers with safe, reliable service and to help the state meet its aggressive carbon reduction and clean energy goals.
The program is submitted to the Massachusetts DPU earlier this month, call for the investment of another $200 million from 2022 through 2025 to further improve substation automation, wireless communications and expand other programs that would have a number of other benefits including reducing peak demand in line losses.
Reducing line losses, an important element in achieving our 2030 carbon neutrality goal.
In the same docket, we're asking the DPU to take the first steps to allow us to embark on a 6-year effort to implement advanced metering infrastructure for our nearly 1.5 million Massachusetts Electric customers along with a new communications network, Meter Data Management System and Customer Information system.
We project capital investment associated with the full program to be in the $500 million to $600 million range over the period of 2023 through 2028.
These technologies are critical enabling investment that support the state's 2050 clean energy goals.
Also, we recently filed an application to issue up to $725 million of long-term debt at Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts.
