I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15.
We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date.
Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD for year-to-date second quarter 2021 totaled nearly $1.9 billion, with approximately $1.2 billion related to second quarter operations, as highlighted on Page 16.
Year-to-date, we have returned $255 million to our shareholders through payment of our quarterly base dividend.
As a reminder, we target a total return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD; in the case of 2021, the majority will be returned to the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt.
During the second quarter, we repaid our $225 million variable rate term loan due in 2026 and incurred no early extinguishment charges.
We plan to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter.
Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter and full year 2021 are presented on Pages 17 and 18.
In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than second quarter.
In the third quarter, we will record a cash inflow of $261 million and a gain of approximately $30 million related to this transaction.
We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter 2020, but earnings will be approximately $20 million higher than one year ago due to a lower average land basis on the mix of properties sold.
As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to $290 million.
We now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 30% to 35% for the year.
For lumber, our quarter-to-date realizations are approximately $425 lower, and current realizations are approximately $535 lower than the second quarter average.
Our quarter-to-date OSB realizations are approximately $155 higher and current realizations are approximately $125 higher than the second quarter average.
As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.
And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.
In May 2021, we announced another increase, which ranges from 15% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters.
We anticipate significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board web stock, as the cost of web stock lags benchmark OSB pricing by approximately 1/4.
As a result, we recorded a $138 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense.
It also shows the $40 million capital expenditure increase we announced back in June for some additional high-return projects across our businesses.
We are now -- we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% to 24% based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.
The $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution has now been approved, and we expect to receive the refund in the third quarter of 2021.
U.S. housing activity continues at an impressive pace, with total housing starts in the second quarter averaging 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits averaging 1.7 million units.
Single-family starts in June reached their highest monthly level since May of 2007.
Looking forward, we remain focused on industry-leading performance across our operations and are on track to deliver our 2021 OpEx target of $50 million to $75 million.
Our balance sheet is extremely strong and with year-to-date adjusted FAD of nearly $1.9 billion, we expect to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
