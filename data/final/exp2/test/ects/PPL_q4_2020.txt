We also received the U.K.'s customer service excellence award for the 28th time since 1992.

LG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on November 25, seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $331 million in electricity and gas base rates.
Given the COVID pandemic and in an effort to reduce the near-term impact of the rate adjustment for our customers, we sought to minimize the size of the requested increase and have included in our request for approval a $53 million economic relief surcredit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustment until mid-2022.
In other notable Kentucky updates, LG&E and KU on January 7 issued a request for proposal for generation capacity to meet a potential energy shortfall that may be created by the anticipated retirements of 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation during this decade.
Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired by 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives.
The utilities are seeking 300 to 900 megawatts of capacity beginning in 2025 to 2028.

That draft plan proposes GBP 6 billion in new investments to support decarbonization, digitalization and enhanced network utilization.
We've outlined more than $14 billion from 2021 to 2025 to support continued modernization of our transmission and distribution networks and to advance a cleaner energy future.

Those increases include $400 million in Kentucky to support full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, $300 million in Pennsylvania for additional transmission investments, as well as incremental funding for IT initiatives focused on digital transformation investments in work optimization, smart grid technology and the customer experience and $200 million in the U.K. due to a shift of certain investments from 2020 to 2021 as a result of COVID-19, additional funding for telecommunications projects and updates to our RIIO-ED2 capital plan.
