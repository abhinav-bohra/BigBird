We're excited to announce that we've executed definitive agreements with Oaktree for $250 million in incremental capital through Holdco notes issued by Ocwen Financial Corporation.
When combined with MAV, we expect the over $460 million in capital provided by Oaktree can enable us to potentially increase our earnings per share by 65% or more once the proceeds are fully invested.
The Oaktree notes have a face value of $285 million with a $35 million original issue discount for net proceeds of $250 million.
The coupon is 12%, plus about 2% for the effective annual cost of the OID.
In addition, Oaktree will receive warrants for 12% of the fully diluted shares of Ocwen.
In terms of use of proceeds, we intend to use $100 million of the proceeds to pay down and support the refinancing of our existing corporate debt in a concurrent refinancing transaction.
The remaining $150 million in proceeds from the Holdco notes will be used to support our on book growth objectives through MSR purchases and funding a portion of the MAV investment.
We do expect the incremental capital in the operating company will allow us to improve the terms of our existing MSR financing which can create up to about $75 million in additional capital from our existing MSRs.
The first tranche is $175 million and that will come in concurrently with the closing of the corporate debt refinancing.
The remaining $75 million will come in concurrent with the closing of MAV.
Oaktree will own 85% and Ocwen will own 15%.
You know, MAV expects to leverage up to $250 million in capital that will be contributed by Oaktree and Ocwen, respectively, based on our relative shares to purchase MSRs and this will be leveraged up roughly one for one with secured MSR financing.
So that gives us the capacity for up to about $60 billion in MSR UPB.
And Ocwen will also earn MSR investment returns on its capital contribution and from profit sharing on returns in MAV above 12%.
In terms of the financial impact of the Oaktree investment in Ocwen, we estimate that a -- on a combined basis, the Holdco notes and MAV can contribute up to $78 million in annualized pre-tax income from full deployment of the capital provided by these two structures.
We estimate full deployment of the proceeds can generate roughly $5 per share in incremental earnings on a fully diluted basis.
This translates to over a 65% increase above our potential baseline earnings per share range which assumes an after-tax ROE range of roughly 10% to 15% on about $414 million of equity.
Using a PE multiple range of some of our peers of roughly 4 times to 6 times forward earnings, the potential incremental value creation is roughly $20 to $30 per share.
This is a 7 times to 10 times multiple of the potential book value per share dilution, assuming the warrants are fully issued and the corresponding increase to our equity from the proceeds related to issuing the warrants.
We expect to source roughly up to $200 billion in incremental total volume over the next couple of years.
And again, it's estimated to source up to $200 billion in incremental volume over the next two years.
The total growth in volume will allow us to grow our total subservicing portfolio to roughly $300 billion by the end of 2022, assuming the NRZ subservicing contract does not renew.
Pretax cash IRRs in our MSRs generated in December were about 12% before MSR financing, that translates to roughly 18% after MSR secured financing.
Adjusted pre-tax profitability was up roughly 15% in the fourth quarter over the third quarter despite declining origination margins.
Annualized adjusted pre-tax profitability has improved over $380 million over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined.
Flow origination volume in the fourth quarter was up 49% over the third quarter and up over 7 times as compared to 2019.
And as a result of that efficiency and our continuous cost improvement, operating expenses are down 44% over the second-quarter 2018 baseline for Ocwen and PHH combined.
That's over a $400 million cost reduction.
We increased our legal and regulatory accrual related to the CFPB matter by $13 million in the fourth quarter, resulting from our efforts to resolve the matter in mediation.
We delivered a record total volume of $30 billion in the fourth quarter.
It translates to roughly an annualized run rate of about $60 billion from our flow channels and about $60 billion annualized from bulk.
Total volume for 2020 was $59 billion versus $26 billion last year, so we've doubled total volume.
Full-year flow and co-issue originations were up 8 times over last year.
Full-year bulk and subservicing adds were up over 48% as compared to last year.
In addition, in the fourth quarter, we were awarded multiple subservicing contracts with projected volume of $16 billion to $24 billion that we expect will board in the first and second quarter.
The average margins fell to about 56 basis points versus our expectation of 77 basis points for Q4.
Our key claims metrics also continued to perform with nearly 100% effectiveness.
In 2020, we provided forbearance relief for over 180,000 consumers and we completed about 40 virtual borrower outreach events to reach consumers potentially impacted by the pandemic.
And we achieved roughly a 50-50 mix of owned servicing and subservicing.
In 2021, looking ahead, the market, we expect the total originations will be down roughly about 17%, with much decline in the second half of the year.
You know Black Knight is reporting that there's still about 16 million to 17 million borrowers who are eligible for refinancing which should continue to drive the refi market in the near-term.
Our reverse origination platform is positioned to support the financial needs of our growing senior population by tapping into an estimated $7.8 trillion of untapped home equity.
Our special servicing expertise and track record of creating non-foreclosure outcomes for consumers, you know, positions us to support the roughly 1.8 million homeowners who are still on forbearance who may need loss mitigation assistance.
We estimate that roughly 85% of these borrowers are delinquent and we further estimate that about 25% will need loss mitigation assistance.
In 2021, our goal is to achieve over $100 billion in volume with the 40-60 mix of owned servicing and subservicing, respectively.
Now we're targeting to grow our seller base again, over 450 sellers in 2021 to support our growth in correspondent and flow volume, as well as, performing and special subservicing opportunities.
We continue to target achieving at least a 30% recapture rate for our recapture platform and we believe our recapture performance is only limited by our operating capacity to address available opportunities.
So we expect to increase staffing levels by over 40% through the course of 2021.
We're targeting to reduce our servicing operating cost by roughly 2 basis points of UPB in this year and reducing corporate overhead expenses by roughly 1 basis points of UPB.
We're executing over 60 technology-enabled projects across the business to drive productivity, cost reduction, improved customer experience, and support growth.
We're tracking roughly $300 million in RMBS call right opportunities.
We expect roughly $125 million will be eligible to call in 2021 and we'll continue to evaluate the variables that impact eligibility and economics of executing these calls throughout the year.
We've been awarded multiple subservicing contracts with projected volume $16 billion to $24 billion and closed approximately $15 billion of MSR bulk purchases which should largely offset the lost revenue.
We also recorded $3 million of higher gain during the quarter, largely driven by higher MSR purchase volumes.
Adjusted pre-tax income is $15 million, $2 million higher than prior quarter, as favorable MSR valuation and lower expenses offset lower revenue.
Notables in the fourth quarter include a $13 million additional CFPB accrual and $4 million in other legal accruals.
We reported a GAAP net loss of $7 million, $2 million improvement over prior quarter and after the $13 million of additional CFPB accrual I previously mentioned.
On the left side of the slide, you can see that our multichannel platform is fueling strong originations volume with growth up 164% quarter over quarter.
Servicing originated volume is up almost 4 times quarter over quarter, driving strong replenishment of 267%.
Adjusted pre-tax income was $35 million, $2 million lower than the prior quarter as higher volume was offset by expected margin normalization and $5 million of investment in our platform.
UPB runoff is being replenished through newly originated servicing and subservicing despite a $16 billion transfer of the NRZ portfolio previously terminated in 2020.
We have a strong subservicing pipeline with our top 15 prospects at approximately $85 billion, with additional opportunities from MAV.
We are seeing roughly 53% of our borrowers on maturing forbearance plans reinstate and 40% extend.
Roughly 4% have progressed to loss mitigation and we are awaiting decision for direction from the borrower on about 3% of plans that have matured.
Our expectation is roughly 75% of borrowers on forbearance will reinstate and less than 25% will need some form of loss assistance.
We ended the quarter with $285 million in liquidity.
We invested $190 million in cash before financing to fund $25 billion of MSR originations, $18 billion higher than the prior quarter, largely driven by opportunistic bulk MSR acquisitions.
Our originations generated strong cash-on-cash unlevered yields of approximately 12% across all channels.
Servicing advances continue to track favorably and actual advances were 29% lower than forecast.
You know, wrap up, let's turn to Page 24.
Our strategic alliance with Oaktree can provide almost $0.5 billion of incremental capital to enable a level of growth, earnings per share accretion, and potential value creation that we could just not achieve on a stand-alone basis.
