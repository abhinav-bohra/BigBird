The severe winter storms in Texas and Japan had an aggregate negative impact on income from operations of approximately $15.5 million.
In Texas, where the impact of the storm this quarter was approximately $13 million, our industry has borne a disproportionate share of the financial burden.
RCEs increased by 10,000 to 450,000 and meters increased by 7,000 to 572,000.
Given our positive outlook, we were pleased to purchase nearly 147,000 shares in a private transaction following the quarter close.
Consolidated revenue increased 30% to $135 million.
Revenue at Genie Retail Energy increased 15% to $91 million.
At Genie Retail Energy International, revenue increased to $42 million from $7 million in the year-ago quarter.
The $35 million increase predominantly reflects our purchase of the outstanding stake in our Orbit joint venture in the U.K. during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the consolidation of its results.
For comparison purposes, Orbit Energy generated $19.6 million in revenue in the year-ago quarter.
Genie Renewables revenue was $2.5 million, a decrease from $18 million in the year-ago quarter when Prism Solar delivered the bulk of a large solar panel order.
Consolidated gross profit decreased $11.4 million to $17.5 million.
We estimate that the winter storms in Texas and Japan together impacted gross profit by approximately $15.5 million and, except for their impact, the quarter's results would have been very strong.
Consolidated SG&A increased to $24.1 million from $19.5 million.
Consolidated loss from operations totaled $6.6 million compared to income from operations of $9.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decrease of $15.8 million.
Adjusted EBITDA was negative $4.5 million compared to positive $10.3 million in the year-ago quarter, a decrease of $14.9 million, primarily due to the Texas and Japan weather and the consolidation of Orbit Energy.
At GRE, income from operations decreased to $1.2 million from $13 million.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $1.5 million from $13.3 million.
Absent the impact of winter storm Uri in Texas, GRE's adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $14.5 million, a record for a domestic supply business.
At GRE International, loss from operations was $6.7 million compared to $2.5 million in the year-ago quarter.
For comparison purposes, Orbit Energy's loss from operations in the first quarter of 2020 was $3 million.
The winter storm in Japan contributed approximately $2.5 million, a $4.1 million decrease.
Genie Renewables income from operations increased to $559,000 from $342,000 a year earlier.
In the year-ago quarter, our gross margin was 9% primarily generated by the Prism Solar panel deliveries.
The first quarter 2021 results suggest there's some early success as our gross margin increased to 45%.
Genie Energy's loss per diluted share was $0.09 compared to earnings per share of $0.20 in the year-ago quarter.
At quarter end, cash, restricted cash and marketable equity securities totaled $41.7 million.
