A year ago, we were contending with the unprecedented disruption and uncertainty from the continued 737 MAX grounding and COVID-19 pandemic.
Since then, the FAA lifted the 737 MAX grounding order and shortly after that the aircraft resumed commercial service.
Today the 737 MAX is certified in the U.S., U.K., Europe and many other parts of the world.
Additionally, Boeing has secured several new orders from airlines, including large orders from Southwest, Alaska Air and Ryanair, who will take delivery of their first newly certified 737 MAX 8200 aircraft in the near future.
The aviation industry saw more than 19,000 aircraft grounded and air traffic down more than 95% at the worst point last April.
In the U.S., the TSA checkpoint travel numbers have been consistently staying above the 1 million mark since early March and more recently, we have seen many days above 1.5 million travelers, including 1.6 million travelers last Sunday.
We believe Spirit is well positioned to benefit from this trend of recovering domestic air travel in the largest aviation markets, given that 85% of our backlog is narrow-body aircraft.
In line with the improved narrow-body outlook, as we described in our 10-K, Spirit is planning to produce about 160 737 MAX aircraft in 2021.
This plan allows for us to burn down the Boeing inventory of 737 MAX shipsets stored in Wichita and Tulsa.
On the A350, schedule changes this year and next year contributed to the forward loss of $29 million that we announced this quarter.
Over the last few months, we have also been working with Boeing on the 787 program.
We have started the rework and Boeing has reinitiated deliveries of the 787.
The rework plan that we have put into place supports Boeing's 787 delivery schedule.
The engineering analysis and the projected rework will drive a forward loss of $29 million.
Overall, our 2021 free cash flow usage is expected to be between $200 million and $300 million after considering the $300 million cash tax benefit.
To date, we have completed roughly 80% of the 450 tasks we have identified to capture synergies and integrate the operations into Spirit.
A large part of our integration focus is capturing the synergies which we projected to be 6% of revenues.
Based on 2021 revenues that are expected to be $700 million, we estimate the synergies to be $42 million.
We are on target to achieve the $42 million and perhaps even exceed it by 2023.
Our Belfast operations have recently completed their first Boeing 777 thrust reverser repair.
All of these actions are contributing to our target of building the Spirit aftermarket business to $500 million in revenue at accretive margins by 2025.
After growing almost 20% in 2020, we expect our defense business revenue to grow 15% in 2021.
We believe we are on track to achieve $1 billion of defense revenue by the mid-2020s with typical defense margins.
The programs of record for where we have work content will generate approximately $6 billion of future revenue.
One step we took was to repay $300 million in floating rate notes in February.
Our next debt maturity is $300 million in 2023.
We also have other pre-payable debt that could be retired as part of our objective to repay $1 billion in the next three years as production rates recover and we start generating positive cash flow.
Both of these narrow-body manufacturing lines will help drive the margin improvement back to our target of 16.5% as production rates recover.
Our defense programs continue to be a bright spot, up 41% as compared to the same quarter of last year.
Turning to deliveries, wide-body program deliveries were 48, down from 91 in the first quarter of 2020, which is a 47% reduction.
The narrow-body program deliveries in the first quarter of 2021 were also lower when compared to 2020 with 171 shipsets in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 221 in 2020.
The main driver of the decrease was the A320 program with 58 less deliveries than the first quarter of 2020.
The first quarter 737 MAX deliveries have gradually increased to 29 compared to 18 shipsets delivered in the first quarter of last year.
Overall, deliveries decreased to 269 shipsets compared to 324 shipsets in the same quarter of last year.
We reported earnings per share of negative $1.65 compared to negative $1.57 per share in the same period of 2020.
Adjusted earnings per share was negative $1.22 per share compared to negative earnings per share of $0.79 in the first quarter of 2020.
Operating margin for the first quarter was negative 14% compared to negative 15.5% in the first quarter of 2020.
This was partially offset by additional forward losses on the 787 and A350 programs compared to the same period last year.
Interest expense and financing fee amortization in the first quarter of 2021 increased $28 million, driven by increased interest expense on debt and higher interest rates compared to the same period in the prior year.
In the first quarter, we recognized forward loss charges of $72 million primarily driven by engineering analysis and rework to support Boeing's resumption of 787 deliveries and lower A350 production rates, coupled with higher one-time costs for production system and quality improvements.
During the first quarter of 2021, an incremental $42 million valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets was recorded.
Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of $198 million, compared to a use of $362 million in the same period of 2020.
This year-over-year improvement is primarily due to favorable working capital management and cost-reduction efforts, partially offset by the absence of the $215 million received last February, as a result of the MOA with Boeing.
Excluding the $215 million of Boeing advance payments received in the first quarter of 2020, free cash flow improved by about $380 million.
For the year, we expect free cash flow to be between negative, $200 million and $300 million.
This includes a cash-tax benefit of approximately $300 million.
We ended the first quarter with approximately $1.4 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of debt.
In February, we prepaid $300 million floating rate notes that were due this year.
As Tom mentioned, we are planning to repay $1 billion in debt in the next three years, the timing of which will be in line with how air traffic and narrow-body production rates recover from the global pandemic.
In the first quarter, Fuselage segment revenues were $437 million, down approximately $115 million compared to 2020, primarily due to lower production volumes on the wide-body programs, partially offset by an increase in 737 MAX defense and the recently acquired Bombardier business jet program revenues.
Operating margin for the quarter was negative 14%, compared to negative 16% in the same period last year.
Increased 737 MAX production and higher defense revenues, helped contribute to the gross profit improvement.
The Fuselage segment recorded $2 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $55 million of net forward losses, during the quarter primarily due to the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 programs.
Propulsion revenue in the quarter improved to $227 million, primarily due to higher revenue from the 737 MAX program and aftermarket revenues.
Operating margin for the quarter was positive 7%, compared to negative 2% in the same quarter of 2020.
The segment recorded $6 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $5 million of net forward losses.
Lower production volumes on the 787 A320 and A350 programs, partially offset by revenue from the recently acquired A220 wing program were the main contributors to the reduction in wing revenue of $224 million.
Operating margin for the quarter was negative 8%, compared to positive 5% in the first quarter of 2020.
The decreases in segment profitability and operating margin were primarily a result of forward losses recognized on the 787 and the A350 programs and lower margin recognized on the A320 and A220 programs, due to increased excess capacity costs.
The segment recorded $13 million of net forward losses and $2 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments.
Our 2021 cash flow is dependent on the planned delivery of approximately 160, 737 MAX shipsets.
We are closely monitoring the remaining regulatory approvals needed for the 737 MAX return to service, as well as the recovery from the global pandemic.
Spirit will benefit from this trend, since 85% of our backlog is narrow-body aircraft.
In 2021, we are planning to deliver about 160, 737 MAX shipsets as Mark just said, which is more than double what we delivered in 2020.
We expect our free cash flow usage for the year will be between $200 million and $300 million.
The acquisition of the assets of Applied Aerodynamics and the establishment of the JV with EGAT in Taiwan will help accelerate the growth of the aftermarket business to $500 million by 2025 at accretive margins.
We believe our defense business revenue is on track to grow 15% this year, after growing nearly 20% in 2020.
We also continue to make good progress on our efforts to delever and to continue driving toward margins of 16.5%.
