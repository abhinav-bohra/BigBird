Our investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA dollars from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025.
That's approximately a 50% increase.
We expect this increase to be accomplished through 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions.
Gross revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.10 to $4.30.
On the positive side, we continue to win the right kind of work and hire the right people, as reflected in our backlog growth and headcount increases over the last 12 months.
At the top line, revenue increased 6.6% year over year to $2 billion, which includes approximately $117 million from inorganic contributions.
Revenue, excluding billable expenses, grew 6.2% year over year to $1.4 billion.
Revenue declined by 2.2% year over year and has been trending down quarter over quarter.
Since defense is roughly 50% of our business portfolio and largely comprised of cost reimbursable work, the macro factors and subsequent top line impacts I noted were especially impactful in this market.
In civil, revenue grew by 25.3% year over year, of which 5.1% was organic, marking our second consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth.
In Intelligence, we recorded our second consecutive quarter of growth at 0.8% year over year.
Lastly, global commercial revenue grew 26.7% compared to the prior-year period.
Net bookings for the third quarter were approximately $797 million, up 29% over the prior-year period, translating to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.39 times and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.28 times.
Total backlog grew approximately 19.2% year over year to $27.8 billion.
Funded backlog grew 11.7% to $4 billion.
Unfunded backlog grew 57.7% to $9.4 billion.
And price options grew 4.4% to $14.3 billion.
As of December 31, we had approximately 29,500 employees, an increase of approximately 1,900 year over year or 6.8%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $222 million, up 8% from the prior-year period.
Adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue was 10.9% compared to 10.8% in the prior-year period.
The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by three factors: first, profitable contract level performance and mix, which includes inorganic contributions; second, prudent cost management; and third, a return to billing for fee within Intel, which had a $2 million negative impact on the prior-year period under the CARES Act, a tailwind that will taper off after this quarter.
Third quarter net income decreased 10.8% year over year to $129 million.
Adjusted net income was $137 million, down 5.5% year over year.
Diluted earnings per share decreased 7.8% to $0.95 from $1.03 the prior-year period.
And adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 1.9% to $1.02 from $1.04.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by a higher effective tax rate following the release of an income tax reserve of $10.2 million in the prior-year period related to the Aquilent acquisition, as well as higher interest expense partially offset by a lower share count due to our share repurchase program.
Our non-GAAP metrics exclude certain acquisition costs and the noncash gain of $7.1 million from the spin-off of SnapAttack during the quarter.
Cash from operations was $21 million in the third quarter, down from $233 million in the prior year comparable period.
Year to date, we have generated $481 million in operating cash flow and $430 million in free cash flow for a free cash flow conversion rate nearing 100% and supporting our strong balance sheet positioning and capital deployment priorities.
During the quarter, we deployed approximately $139 million, inclusive of $50 million in quarterly dividends and $83 million in share repurchases.
Today, we are also pleased to announce that the Board has increased our quarterly dividend by $0.06 to $0.43 per share, payable on March 2 to stockholders of record on February 11.
For the full fiscal year, revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 5.7% to 7.2%.
At the midpoint, our revised guidance range reflects $100 million to $220 million of revenues tied to the uncertainties we outlined earlier.
They break down as follows: $30 million to $80 million tied to funding delays and resulting slowness in deploying staff on sold and funded work; $20 million to $40 million tied to an incremental step down in staff utilization due largely to the continuing pandemic and PTO usage; and $50 million to $100 million from lower pandemic-related travel and the timing of material purchase getting pushed to the right.
As a reminder, the inclusion of the New Year's Eve holiday and minor timing differences in the costing of labor related to the implementation of our next-gen financial management system will become tailwinds in the fourth quarter, adding roughly 175 basis points to the top line.
On the bottom line, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the fiscal year to be approximately 11%.
We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be between $4.10 and $4.30.
We now expect operating cash to be between $700 million and $750 million.
The incremental step-down follows our expectations for lower top line growth and accounts for the $56 million of onetime payments in connection with the Liberty acquisition, which we had anticipated being able to make up through a combination of working capital management and operating performance.
And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million to $100 million.
