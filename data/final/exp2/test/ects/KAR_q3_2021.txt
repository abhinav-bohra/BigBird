For KAR overall, we generated $535 million in revenue, which was a decline of 10% from Q3 of last year.
We generated a total gross profit of $222 million, representing 50.1% of revenue, excluding purchased vehicles.
We generated $96.6 million in adjusted EBITDA.
Cash generated from operations for the quarter was $57 million.
Within the ADESA segment, we facilitated the sale of 586,000 vehicles, representing over $9 billion in gross auction proceeds.
Now, these volumes are down 33% versus Q3 of last year.
Within that, our total commercial volume was down by 51% versus Q3 of last year and our total dealer consigned volume actually increased by 20%.
51% of our sales in the third quarter was from off-premise locations, and this is similar to our experience in the first half of this year.
We sold 118,000 vehicles on the TradeRev and BacklotCars platforms on a combined basis.
We generated $274 in gross profit per vehicle sold in the ADESA segment.
This was driven in part by strong auction revenue per vehicle sold and is higher than the gross profit per vehicle generated in the first half of this year and 10% greater than the same statistic from Q3 of last year.
SG&A for KAR overall was $134 million for the quarter and SG&A for the ADESA segment was $126 million and that was down $14 million from Q1 of this year.
AFC had 351,000 loan transactions in the quarter.
This was an increase of 8% versus the same quarter last year and it was in line with the levels that we'd expect.
Revenue per loan transaction was also higher, 20% higher than Q3 of last year, at $215 for the quarter.
As I mentioned, commercial seller volumes were down by 51% versus the same quarter last year.
Most meaningful to KAR is the disruption in the off-lease volumes, which historically have represented approximately 60% of our total commercial seller volumes.
I would say that repossession volumes are relatively stable at about 70% of normal levels right now.
So first of all, if we look at our total dealer consignment volumes at KAR, and by which I mean digital and physical combined, we sold 274,000 dealer consigned vehicles in the third quarter.
That represented an increase of 20% compared to KAR's total dealer volume in Q3 of last year.
Some of that increase is driven by the acquisition of BacklotCars, but I'm pleased that we were able to increase our overall volume by 20%, given the tight supply dynamics that exist across our industry.
If we look at the digital dealer-to-dealer category only, our Q3 volume of 118,000 -- was 118,000 vehicle sold.
The comparable metric for Q3 of last year was 58,000.
So, we grew our total digital dealer-to-dealer volume by 105%.
And if we include BacklotCars in last year's number, the growth is approximately 19%.
The Carwave acquisition has approximately 100,000 vehicles sold per annum.
If we look at new vehicle registrations statistics, there are more new vehicle registrations in California each year than in the smallest 20 states combined.
And finally, the addition of Carwave means that our current run rate with digital dealer-to-dealer transactions is now very close to 600,000 vehicles sold per annum and continuing to grow.
So, we are well on our way toward achieving the target that I established in -- on our Analyst Day of 1.2 million digital dealer-to-dealer transactions annually by 2025.
Our Analyst Day materials pointed to an SG&A opportunity of $30 million.
In terms of dealer-to-dealer, we are growing our volume with our combined digital and physical volume up 20% versus the same quarter last year.
The addition of Carwave means that we're now at an annual run rate of close to 600,000 vehicles sold per annum and growing.
Sanjeev became an observer on our Board through Periphas Capital's participation in our 2020 pipe transaction, and he previously served on our Board from 2007 to 2013.
The average selling price in our commercial off-premise segment primarily openly was $21,500 in the third quarter compared to $19,400 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2020.
Digital dealer-to-dealer representing BacklotCars and TradeRev had an average sale price of $10,400 in Q3 compared to $8,900 last year.
And our on-premise auctions, which includes a mix of commercial and dealer consignment, had an average selling price of $15,000 per vehicle compared to $13,300 one year ago.
The high percentage of transactions being grounding dealer purchases caused auction fees per transaction on this platform to decline 20% year-over-year in the third quarter.
Another positive in the third quarter was the gross profit per vehicle in the ADESA segment, achieving $274 gross profit per car sold in Q3 compared to $249 in the prior year, and this was a strong performance.
While we are very focused on improving our cost structure and increasing gross profit per unit over historical levels, our business prospers when there are more transactions, even if gross profit per unit were lower than $274.
The third quarter did benefit from royalty revenue received from Insurance Auto Auctions based on the number of non-insurance vehicles sold by IAA over the previous 12 months.
Consistent with the growth in volume in the dealer-to-dealer channel at ADESA, AFC saw an increase in the number of loan transactions, 8%; an increase in revenue per loan transaction, 20%; and an increase in adjusted EBITDA, 63%.
Even though gross profit per unit at ADESA was $274, the gross profit as a percent of revenue, excluding purchased vehicles, declined to 43% in Q3 as compared to the prior year's 49% gross profit.
The one item that will be a permanent increase in our costs as compared to the last 18 months is the loss of the Canadian employee wage subsidy.
We have been benefiting from the Canadian program since early 2020 and approximately $1.5 million to $4 million of direct cost per quarter going back to the second quarter of 2020 were subsidized in Canada.
This represents about a 70 bps increase in gross -- increase in cost or decrease in gross profit percent that will be recurring.
Our total leverage is at 3.2 times adjusted EBITDA.
This has moved above 3 times due to the low performance over the past 12 months.
Our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA is $404 million.
We funded the $450 million purchase price with cash on hand.
We have $109 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that was set to expire at the end of October.
