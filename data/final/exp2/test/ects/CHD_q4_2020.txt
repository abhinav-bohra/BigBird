We protected our people, we found a way to run the plants and warehouses safely, we set production and shipping records, we figured out how to make hand sanitizer in our U.K. plant, we operated the company with 2,000 remote employees, we pivoted our marketing messages to support a 60% increase in e-commerce sales, we installed the new packaging lines with the assistance of off-site engineers using Google classes, we added overflow warehouses, and we validated new suppliers and co-manufacturers.
All in, we expect to deliver 3% organic sales growth and 6% to 8% earnings per share growth in 2021.
And this is on top of almost 10% organic growth and 15% earnings per share growth in 2020, which exceeded our 2020 outlook when we last spoke in October.
Steve has had a spectacular career with Church & Dwight, spanning over 20 years.
Whether you've been a short term one year shareholder of Church & Dwight, three, five, 10 or 15 years, you're very pleased with our performance.
Every year, we expect to grow our top line organically 3% and our bottom line 8%.
Well, if you take a look back over the last 10 years, you'll see that we've exceeded the 3% target every year except 2013 and 2017.
With respect to 8% EPS, you can see over many, many years, we're consistent.
We have an Evergreen model that is very familiar to all of our existing shareholders, 3% top line, 8% bottom line.
Now, where does the 3% organic growth come from?
Well, 2% from the U.S., 6% from international and 5% from the specialty products.
We focus on power brands, we have 13 power brands in our company that are displayed here on this chart.
And those 13 power brands, deliver 80% of our revenues and profits.
We have a nice split between premium and value, 58% premium and 42% value.
We're largely a U.S. company, only 17% of our consumer business is international, so lots and lots of runway.
One of our big advantages is that we're nimble, we're small, we only have 5,000 employees.
If you went back to the year 2000, the only brand we owned was ARM & HAMMER.
We were up only $800 million in sales in the year 2000.
In '21, we're going to cross $5 billion.
And of those 13 power brands, 12 of them were acquired since 2001.
If you go back just a few years in 2015, we were a laggard when it came to online sales, less than 1% of our sales were online.
At the end of 2019, it was 8%, at the end of '20, largely due to COVID, it's over 13%.
We have a low exposure to private label, only 12%, and if you look at the categories, there's only five of our 17 categories where we have significant private label share and those shares have been pretty stable over the last five years.
We saw growth in 12 of our 17 categories, average 9.8% overall.
We saw an over 50% growth in vitamin, double-digit growth in baking soda and single-digit in many other categories.
As you can see in this chart, 11 of our 17 categories increased household penetration.
We added 8.6 million households to ARM & HAMMER, More Power to You, 2.4 million to OxiClean Stain Fighter and in the second half alone, Vitafusion added 3 million more households.
Vitamins grew an amazing 58% in consumption.
It takes 66 days to form a new habit, and consumers clearly formed new habits, regarding taking vitamins.
20% of consumer started taking vitamins, 57%, that means more than half, are now taking vitamins daily.
You can see that the share of gummies on total increased by nearly one-third, that is, it is now 23% and who would be better placed to profit from that growth than the number 1 vitamin gummy, Vitafusion.
As you can see, laundry grew 5.5% in 2020 but was a lot of swings due to consumers' stockpiling and changing habits.
It is hard to get good statistics on cat ownership but we do know that 6% more households bought Cat Litter in 2020, leading me to believe that this is the minimum of additional cat owners.
18 to 24 year olds can't wait to get their social lives back and with college campuses reopening, 2021 looks promising.
In 2020, a year with difficult supply situations, the majority of our brands, which means seven out of our 13 power brands have grown share.
We have more than 500 influencers globally enjoying and recommending our brand.
We have reached more than 200 million consumers via those recommendations and this number will definitely grow in 2021.
79% of our consumers want germs removed from their laundry, introducing OxiClean Laundry and Home Sanitizer.
This product kills 99.9% of bacteria and viruses, it also removes germs, odors and stains.
Two-thirds of consumers find flossing difficult and only 16% floss daily.
Introducing Waterpik Sonic-Fusion 2.0, the most successful new product launch in power flosser history just got better.
This product is 30% smaller than traditional plug-in models, has 90 seconds of water capacity and with a lithium-ion battery that lasts up to four weeks with a single charge.
33% of consumers plan to purchase more immune-support supplements.
It is the only gummy to deliver over 100% daily value of the top three immune ingredients, Vitamin C, zinc and elderberry, it also includes a new ingredient, Manuka honey.
We finished 2020 posting organic growth of 8.6%, well above our 6% Evergreen goal.
This is remarkable given the fact that during Q2 at the height of the pandemic, we delivered less than 1% organic growth for the division.
Q4 finished up a remarkable 14.9% behind growth in both our domestic subsidiary markets as well as our GMG business, where a resurgent Asia was a key driver of performance.
We have now built an international business that's over $800 million and approaching scale in key markets and we feel that there is not a market that we cannot reach.
We've also tripled the historic CAGR of the division from 3% to 9%.
Barry came to Church & Dwight from Johnson & Johnson, where he worked for 14 years across consumer, pharmaceutical and medical device businesses, where he developed a depth of experience in both U.S. domestic and global markets during his time there.
In closing, it has been my sincere pleasure to work for this great company for the past 20 years.
This is as true today as when I joined in 1999.
And your work over 20 plus years has impacted the entire Church & Dwight organization.
As you saw under Steve's leadership, we've built International into an $820 million business that's growing faster than ever.
And as a reminder to this audience, we think about our International business in two buckets, our subsidiaries, where we have fully staffed Church & Dwight teams on the ground in Canada, Mexico, U.K., France, Germany and Australia, and our Global Markets Group, which covers 130 other markets via distributors who represent our brands.
As you've seen, GMG has been on a tear and now represents 34% of all international sales, followed by Canada and our European subsidiaries and then, our Australia and Mexican subsidiaries.
From a growth standpoint, our subsidiaries grew plus 4.8% in 2020 and GMG continued its stellar run with explosive growth of plus 19%.
As I mentioned earlier, GMG is now our largest entity with outstanding growth of plus 19%.
For context, our top CPG competitors derive over 25% of international sales from emerging markets in which we both compete, while C&D only realizes only 7% of our international revenue from them.
From an acquisition standpoint, our distributor coverage in 130 plus markets gives us a great footprint for expansion and we've been making excellent headway on new acquisitions like Waterpik and Flawless, but we're also still making excellent progress on some of our older acquisitions like Batiste and our VMS brands.
However, what you might find interesting is the visualization here showing if there are more consumers living in Asia than in the rest of the world combined, including 4.5 billion middle income consumers who represent our target audience for Church & Dwight brands.
However, you heard Britta talk about the powerhouse influencers that we're leveraging in the U.S. and I'm happy to share that we're using them abroad as well, with plants in 10 of our largest global markets that are sure to drive awareness and trial of this great new addition to our portfolio.
I mentioned earlier that we love all of our acquisitions here in international, even those that are a bit older and an example of how we're still greenhousing some of these older brands can be seen first with Batiste where we've grown at a 20% CAGR over the last five years and are still under-indexed in household penetration versus our lead market in the U.K.
We continue to launch in new markets and drive household penetration in existing markets and again have lots more room to run with household penetration less than 2% in most global markets.
One example of a market where we're investing significant time and resources on VMS is in China, where sales were up more than 30% in 2020.
Last but not least, we remain committed to doing all of the above, while continuing to use our increasing scale, pricing power in key markets and our personal care weighted mix to keep increasing operating margin by 50 basis points per year.
We did even better than that in 2020 where we grew 120 basis points and we remain committed to further continuous improvements here.
So in closing, we remain very excited about International and remain committed to our 6% organic growth target, which is also consistent with our outlook for 2021, and as a reminder, this is on top of almost 9% organic growth we experienced in 2020.
You heard me speak earlier about what our Evergreen model is, it's 3% annual organic growth, 2% from the U.S., 6% from International and 5% from the Specialty Products.
Our specialty products business is a $300 million business, two-thirds is animal productivity and one-third is specialty chemicals.
Less than 1% of our sales were from non-dairy.
In '21, we expect it to cross 30%.
As we say -- we opened the program today, pointing out that we have 13 brands that we call our power brands.
If you run your eyes across this page, you can see back in 1888, we -- the company introduced pro-environmental wall charts and trading cards that we put in our packages as a promotion for the environment.
If you went 20 years later to 1990, we were still the only corporate sponsor of Earth Day.
More recently, in 2016, 50% of our global electricity demand was supplied by renewable energy sources.
In 2018, we crossed 100%.
Reduce water and our wastewater by 25% by 2022.
For solid waste, to increase our solid waste recycling rate to 75% by the end of 2021.
We want to achieve 100% carbon-neutral status for all of our global operations by 2025 and of all those three, that's the one I'm most excited about.
We're almost $1 million of sales per employee, you'd normally expect that off a start-up.
Capex as a percentage of sales has been about 2% for as long as I've been with the company.
The other thing that may not be appreciated is that about 25% of our global sales are manufactured by third parties.
Number one, we only buy brands that are number 1 or number 2 in their categories.
Number two, we only buy brands that can grow 3% or better and have gross margins that are equal to or better than our corporate gross margins.
Our most recent acquisition is Zicam, that's a number 1 Zinc supplement in the United States in the adult cold shortening category.
Just to wrap up the M&A section, we have 13 brands today, we're shooting for 20 tomorrow.
So first off is the Evergreen model and our shareholders know that we've been talking about this for a very long time, 3% top line, 8% bottom line.
So 3% for net sales growth, 25 basis points for gross margin expansion, flat marketing as a percentage of sales, which is typically higher dollars as we grow the top line.
And then we leverage SG&A by 25 basis point.
That gets us to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and about 8% earnings per share growth.
Q4 2020 was 10.8% organic sales growth, 11% domestic organic sales growth, 14.9% for international and minus 1.2% for SPD.
Gross margin was down 280 basis points, but in line with what our expectations were.
Remember our outlook was down 250 basis points for the quarter.
Now that 280 included a 40 basis point drag because we recognized some of our supply chain workers as the pandemic spiked the again.
And then, marketing change was up 140 basis points in the quarter as we invested behind our brands to enter 2021 with momentum.
SG&A was leveraged by 70 basis points.
And then, earnings per share was $0.53, our outlook was $0.50 to $0.52.
So we beat the midpoint of the range by $0.02.
Organic was 9.5%, domestic was 10.7%, international 8.6% and SPD was 0.4%.
So just really a strong year to have a 10% organic full-year number.
Gross margin was 45.2% or down 30 basis points, really driven because of COVID and incremental tariffs, but we'll get into the detail in a minute.
Marketing was 12.1% or higher by 30 basis points.
Adjusted SG&A is 14.1% or down 10 basis points, so we did leverage SG&A.
And so, earnings per share was up 15% or $2.83 and then cash was up to $990 million, a $400 million above our $890 million estimate a year ago.
And then, finally that translates into 125% free cash flow conversion, we do a great job converting net income into cash flow.
So for Q4, we had positive price volume mix, similar to the way we've had it all year long plus 130 basis points.
Then, inflation was a drag of 310 basis points, but that included a few items, commodities, distribution with a tight trucking market, labor increases and then investments.
COVID costs were 150 basis point drag, which included a 40 basis point drag for the supplemental bonus that we discussed earlier.
Incremental tariffs for Waterpik was a 90 basis point drag for the quarter, and then productivity programs were plus 160, so there's a lot of great work behind our good to great program.
Acquisition, that's really Zicam, for the month of December, a positive margin mix, and then Flawless accounting was down 30 basis points.
And that's how we get to down 280 basis points for the quarter.
And then, all that translates into the full year to be down 30 basis points.
Number three is acquisition synergies, you heard us a few months ago talking about Zicam, and we signed up for $5 million of synergies for Zicam, as an example.
So at a high level, our outlook consists of reported sales growth of 4.5%, that's really the organic number of 3% plus the impact of Zicam.
Organic is 3%, operating profit margin expansion of 100 basis points, which is almost double our 50 basis point expansion for our Evergreen model.
And then, adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%.
First, the 4.5% reported and then we get into the 3% organic sales growth.
And it's very consistent with what you just heard from Matt and Barry and Britta, 2% for domestic, 6% for international and 5% for SPD.
Now, the 3% organic growth, it does have a couple of strategic choices that we've made previously in there.
So we would have been at 4%, I just want to give you context there.
Gross margin is up 50 basis points.
We'll go through that detail in a minute and marketing is down 30 basis as we get back to kind of the average for pre-pandemic levels is around 11.8 and that's what we plan on doing in 2021.
SG&A, we leveraged by 20 basis points and then were up 100 basis points for operating margin.
Now you might ask if you're leveraging the operating margin by 100 basis points, why aren't you higher on the earnings per share growth outlook?
It's just 8%, your Evergreen model is 50 basis points and your 8% earnings per share growth.
Our tax rate in 2020 was 19% and we're going back to the consistent average of around 21%, 22%.
And so, as a result, we're up 100 basis points on operating margin, just really strong base business plan, up 6% to 8% on EPS, and then up to approximately $1 billion of cash flow generation, cash from operations.
Okay, here's a track record of our organic sales over the last 10 years.
We've typically averaged around 4%, this year we're calling 3% for 2021 and as I said before, if you add in some of those strategic decisions we made, we are closer to the 4% on an apples to apples basis.
So plus 50 basis points in 2021.
The detail of the 50 basis points of expansion in '21 really leads off with price and volume mix continuing to expand.
Inflation and the COVID costs are drag of around 130 basis points.
And then productivity programs are a tailwind of 100 basis points.
Those two pretty much offset and we're at plus 50 basis points for the year.
So first half gross margin is down 50 basis points.
Moving to marketing, we have a long track record of spending between 11% and 12% on marketing.
In years past, about -- the average is around 11.
8% and we're saying in 2021, we're going to get back to the pre-pandemic average of around 11.8%.
In 2021, we're going to be down 20 basis point, is our expectation, but if you look at this on a cash basis on the next slide, you can see how much we're actually leveraging cash SG&A.
We're going to be down 60 basis points in 2021.
6% to 8% earnings per share growth of $3 to $3.06 is the outlook.
And that's on top of 15% growth in 2020.
For many of the same reason, earnings per share growth is expected to be down 5% in the first half, as we get back to normal promotional levels.
In the second half, we expect to be up around 20% and that's because of a return to historical marketing level, improved promotional efficiency, lower COVID costs, tariff remediation in those actions that we're taking and 2020 investments that aren't going to repeat in the back half of the year.
We have a long track record of free cash flow conversion, 122% over the time period.
We had 125% in 2020.
Well, we have great working capital management, we've moved from 52 days down to 16 days is the outlook for 2021.
And if you strip out the Chinese supply chains that we have for Waterpik and Flawless, those numbers are actually closer to five days as we approach 0 working capital.
We expect to end the year at 1.3 times debt-to-EBITDA at the end of 2021.
We have the ability to do up to $4.2 billion deal and still maintain our credit rating.
And as you saw, we're going to end the year at 1.3 times debt-to-EBITDA in 2021, is our expectation.
If you looked back at our history, we usually bump around 2% of sales or below.
In years past, we've had capacity additions and that's what happened in 2009, we had our York laundry plant and that's when we bumped up to about about 5.5%.
In 2011, we bumped up to 2.8% when we had our Victorville laundry plant and so 2021, 2022 are no different.
We think we're going to spike up to around 3.5% as we add these capacity investments.
For over 120 years we've been paying dividends and in 2021, our outlook is a 5.2% dividend increase on top of increases of 5.5%, 4.5% and 14.5% these past few years.
In addition, we did a $300 million ASR that started in December and we expect to complete by the end of Q1.
