We generated $14.3 million net income or $1.28 of diluted earnings per share as a result of continued quality growth in our loan portfolio, a strong credit profile, disciplined expense management and low funding costs.
We originated $359 million of loans in the fourth quarter, which was comparable to the prior year and up nearly $51 million or 16% from the third quarter.
This drove sequential growth in our total portfolio of $77 million or 7%.
Our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $80 million or 8% quarter over quarter.
And on a year-over-year basis, our core loan portfolio grew by $19 million or 2%, and an impressive result considering the circumstances presented in 2020.
Our net credit loss rate during the quarter was 6.9%, a 210-basis-point improvement from last year, and we ended the quarter with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 5.3%, down from 7% last year.
Our $150 million allowance for credit losses as of December 31 continues to compare quite favorably to our 30-plus day contractual delinquency of $60.5 million and includes a $30.4 million reserve for additional credit losses associated with COVID-19.
This reserve assumes an unemployment rate of 9% at the end of 2021.
In addition, with $452 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $203 million of available liquidity as of February 5, we have access to more than enough capital to invest in our business and fund our ambitious growth plans.
Earlier today, we also amended our ABL facility to provide an additional $20 million of flexibility to return capital to our shareholders in the future, whether through dividends or share repurchases.
Approximately $250 million securitization garnered wide interest from investors, and priced at a record low average-weighted coupon of 2.08%, nearly 80 basis points better than our previous securitization.
The proceeds from the securitization will be used to retire our RMIT 2018-2 securitization, thereby significantly reducing our cost of capital and further strengthening our balance sheet.
In December, we closed 20% of our branch originations through the remote loan closing process.
Over the next 18 months, we will acquire new customers through innovation and geographic expansion.
In parallel with our digital investments, we will expand our operations into four to five new states over the next 18 months.
To that end, we plan to open between 15 and 20 net new branches in 2021.
While Illinois has recently passed legislation to cap the all-in APR at 36%, we feel that it remains a terrific opportunity to enter a new market with our digitally enabled business model and take advantage of the competitive disruptions from the recent legislation.
As of year-end 2020, 80% of our loan portfolio had an APR at or below 36%.
As of year-end, 61% of our total portfolio had been underwritten using the enhanced credit standards that we deployed during the pandemic.
As we've said previously, any additional stimulus such as the recent $600 stimulus checks, will push COVID-related losses into the second half of 2021.
We generated net income of $14.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.28, resulting from quality growth in our portfolio, a strong credit profile, disciplined expense management and low funding costs.
Page 4 shows our strong portfolio growth in the second half of 2020, driven by increased loan demand and our new growth initiatives.
We grew $114 million from June to December of 2020, with $77 million of this growth in fourth quarter.
We also increased our core finance receivables by $120 million from June to December of 2020 with $80 million of this growth in fourth quarter.
Page 5 displays our portfolio growth and mix trends through year-end 2020.
We closed the quarter with net finance receivables of $1.1 billion, up $77 million or 7% sequentially and $3 million year over year.
Our new growth initiatives drove $36 million of the $77 million of sequential growth.
Our core loan portfolio grew $80 million or 8% sequentially and $19 million year over year.
We continued our mix shift toward large loans, which represent 63% of our portfolio as of fourth-quarter 2020.
Moving to Page 6, as Rob mentioned earlier, originations continued to rebound in the fourth quarter.
Branch originations grew from $233 million in the third quarter of 2020 to $272 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% improvement.
Meanwhile, direct mail and digital originations increased from $75 million in the third quarter to $87 million in the fourth quarter, a 16% improvement.
Total originations in December increased 7% year over year.
On Page 7, we show our digitally sourced originations, which were 29% of our new borrower volume in fourth quarter, the highest we've seen.
During the fourth quarter, large loans were 60% of our digitally sourced originations.
Turning to Page 8.
Total revenue declined 1% due to the continued product mix shift toward large loans and the portfolio composition shift toward higher-credit quality customers.
In the first quarter, due to our seasonal pattern, we expect total revenue yield to be 180 basis points lower than fourth quarter and interest and fee yield to be 140 basis points lower.
Moving to Page 10.
Our net credit loss rate was 6.9% for the fourth quarter of 2020, a 210-basis-point improvement year over year and a 90-basis-point improvement from the third quarter of 2020.
The credit quality of our portfolio remains stable, as can be seen on Page 11.
Our 30-plus day delinquency rate of 5.3% in December, continued to track near historic lows, even with the usage of borrower assistance programs remaining at pre-pandemic levels of 2.2%.
Our delinquency level of 5.3% is 60 basis points higher than the third quarter, primarily due to normal seasonality, but it represents a 170-basis-point improvement year over year.
Turning to Page 12, we ended the third quarter with an allowance for credit losses of $144 million or 13.6% of net finance receivables.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the allowance increased by $6 million to $150 million or 13.2% of net finance receivables.
The base reserve increased by $7.5 million due to portfolio growth and was partially offset by $1.5 million of COVID-specific reserves, resulting in $30.4 million of COVID-specific reserves as of quarter end.
The severity and the duration of our macroeconomic assumptions remained relatively consistent with our third-quarter model, including an assumption that unemployment is 9% at the end of 2021.
Our $150 million allowance for credit losses as of December 31 and compares favorably to our 30-plus day contractual delinquency of $60.5 million.
Flipping to Page 13.
G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $44.8 million, up $3.9 million year over year but better than our sequential guidance for the quarter by $0.7 million.
The increase in G&A expense was primarily driven by $3 million in higher marketing expenses and digital investments to support our growth initiatives.
Overall, we expect G&A expenses for the first quarter to be higher than the fourth quarter by approximately $1 million, encompassing investments in increased marketing, our digital capabilities and our state expansion plans.
Turning to Page 14.
Interest expense of $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1 million lower than in the prior-year period due to the lower interest rate environment.
Our fourth-quarter annualized interest expense as a percentage of average net receivables was 3.3%, a 40-basis-point improvement year over year.
We purchased $50 million of interest rate caps in the fourth quarter to take advantage of the favorable rate environment.
In the first quarter, we expect interest expense to be approximately $9 million.
As Rob mentioned, earlier this week, we priced an approximately $250 million securitization at a record low average-weighted coupon of 2.08%.
Proceeds from the securitization will be used to retire our RMIT 2018-2 securitization, which had a weighted average coupon of 4.87%.
In the fourth quarter, we accelerated $0.8 million for the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the RMIT 2018-2 transaction in advance of the expected repayment this quarter.
Our effective tax rate during the fourth quarter of 2020 was 23.3%, compared to 24.5% in the prior-year period, better-than-expected due to tax benefits on share-based compensation.
For 2021, we are expecting an effective tax rate of approximately 25.5%.
Page 15 is a reminder of our strong funding profile.
Our fourth-quarter funded debt-to-equity ratio remained at a very conservative 2.8:1.
Low leverage, coupled with $150 million in loan loss reserves provides a strong balance sheet.
As of February 5, we had $452 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $203 million of available liquidity, consisting of a combination of unrestricted cash on hand and immediate availability to draw down cash from our revolving credit facilities.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 435,116 shares at a weighted average share price of $27.58.
As of the beginning of the year, we still had $18 million of availability remaining under our $30 million share repurchase program announced in third quarter of 2020.
In addition, our board of directors recently declared a dividend of $0.20 per common share for the first quarter of 2021.
