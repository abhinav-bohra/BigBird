First, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by more than 10% as gross margins expanded to reflect the benefits of product simplification and the price improvements we achieved.
Second, we generated a return on assets above 10%, up about 1 point from the prior year as we continue to grow EBITDA at a faster rate than our assets.
We entered the new year with the dollar value of our backlog, up an astounding 50%, giving us both visibility and confidence moving forward.
Over the last 10 years, as we've executed our balanced growth strategy, we've translated incremental gains and operating metrics into more than $200 million of improvement in adjusted EBITDA.
At the same time, we've actually reduced our operating assets by about 10%.
Over the last five years, we've spent nearly $2.3 billion on land and land development activity.
That's a big-sounding number, but it was about $270 million less than the cash we generated from the land related to our home closings.
In fact, over that same time period, we spent about $450 million retiring and refinancing debt.
Entering 2021, our liquidity and anticipated profitability are such that we expect to achieve the last leg of our debt retirement objective, which is to get total debt below $1 billion by the end of 2022 using only a portion of our future profits.
Looking at the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, new home orders increased nearly 40% to 2,009, driven by the highest fourth quarter sales pace we've achieved in the last decade.
Homebuilding revenue decreased 12% to $679 million, primarily driven by a 14% decrease in closings related to the impact of the pandemic on order and construction timing.
Our gross margin, excluding amortized interest, impairments and abandonments, was 21.7%, up approximately 180 basis points.
SG&A was relatively flat on an absolute basis but rose as a percentage of total revenue to 11.1%, reflecting the decrease in revenue.
This led to adjusted EBITDA of $77.1 million in the quarter, down slightly in dollar terms, but up over 70 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 11.2%.
Total GAAP interest expense was down nearly 16% or $6 million.
Our tax expense for the quarter was about $9 million for an average annual tax rate of 25%.
Finally, these components taken together led to $24.6 million of net income from continuing operations or $0.82 per share in earnings this quarter.
Orders are expected to be essentially flat despite an approximately 15% decline in community count.
Our ASP is expected to be approximately $380,000.
We expect gross margin to be up more than 150 basis points, around 21.5%.
SG&A as a percentage of total revenue should be down about 50 basis points, reflecting the benefit of our continued focus on controlling costs.
We expect EBITDA to be up more than 20%.
Our tax rate is expected to be about 25%.
And this should all lead to earnings per share above $0.30, up significantly versus the prior year.
We ended the fourth quarter with $578 million of liquidity, up more than $200 million versus the prior year.
This reflected about $328 million of unrestricted cash and nothing outstanding on our revolver.
We are positioned to emphasize growth even with the commitment to retire more than $50 million of debt this year.
Fourth quarter land spending of $116 million, but our full year total spend of $441 million, it was about $100 million below the amount we generated from the land related to home closings, reflecting the deliberate pause in spending we undertook at the onset of the COVID pandemic.
We expect to recapture this activity in 2021, which is likely to result in land spend approaching $600 million.
As a matter of business [Phonetic], we grew our option lot as a percentage of active lots by 6 points to 35% last quarter -- last year and expect a similar improvement this year.
Bob joined me here 12 years ago at a very difficult time in our company's history and was integral in our turnaround.
