Across the La-Z-Boy enterprise, we delivered all-time record high sales of $525 million, making and selling more furniture in the quarter than we ever have in modern history, even with production running only 12 weeks in the quarter, due to our annual one week maintenance shutdown in July, versus 13 weeks in most quarters.
Written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network increased 10% versus the prior year quarter, and has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 13% across the last two years since pre-pandemic, demonstrating the continued strength of demand for our La-Z-Boy branded products.
Written same-store sales for our Company-owned Retail segment increased 22% versus the prior year period, and at a compounded annual growth rate of 16% over the last two years.
And Joybird continued on its strong growth journey writing 31% more business than in last year's first quarter and growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 35% across the last two years.
And also during the quarter, we continued to return value to shareholders with a dividend payment and $36 million of share repurchases, and we've recently expanded our repurchase authorization.
On a consolidated basis, fiscal '22 first quarter sales increased 84% to a record $525 million, reflecting strong demand, capacity increases, and a comparison to the fiscal '21 first quarter when we restarted our plants at reduced capacity after a month-long shutdown and most retailers were closed for a portion of the quarter due to COVID-19.
Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 first quarter, sales increased 27% for a compounded annual growth rate of about 13%.
Consolidated GAAP operating income increased to $34 million and non-GAAP operating income increased to $35 million.
Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 6.5% and non-GAAP operating margin was 6.6% reflecting expected significant short-term pressure on wholesale margins as the realization of previously announced pricing actions trailed escalating input costs, and we continue to invest in capacity expansion.
GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54 for the fiscal 2022 first quarter versus $0.10 in the prior quarter.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.55 in the current year quarter versus $0.18 in last year's first quarter.
Starting with our wholesale segment, delivered sales for the quarter grew 76% to $393 million compared with the prior year period, compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 first quarter, sales were 23% higher for a compounded annual growth rate of 11%.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the wholesale segment was 4.7%, reflecting expected gross margin pressure as raw material and freight cost increases outpaced the realization of previously announced pricing actions and we continue to invest in bringing online new capacity.
For the quarter, delivered sales doubled, increasing 100% to our first quarter record of $182 million and delivered same-store sales increased 92% versus the year ago quarter, which was impacted by COVID.
Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20, first quarter, sales increased 27% for a compounded annual growth rate of 13%, reflecting strong execution at the store level.
Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 11.2%, another first quarter record, driven primarily by fixed cost leverage on the higher delivered sales volume.
Last year's first quarter margin was negative 6.8% with the period marked by a significant reduction in delivered sales due to delays in product deliveries and COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns in April as well as retail closures, with some stores closures extending into June.
We have approximately 25 project scheduled this fiscal year for the Company-owned stores, out of a total of approximately 35 projects across the network.
Sales for Joybird which was reported in corporate and other, increased 188% to $39 million, almost tripling from the prior year first quarter.
From the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 first quarter, delivered sales increased 125% for a compounded annual growth rate of about 50%, reflecting Joybird's strong positioning in the direct-to-consumer marketplace as well as excellent end-to-end execution by the team.
Pulling all this together, consolidated non-GAAP gross margin for the fiscal '22 first quarter decreased 270 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily driven by significant increases in commodity and freight costs, in addition to start-up costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and labor challenges on our wholesale businesses.
Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of sales for the quarter decreased 620 basis points, primarily reflecting fixed cost leverage on the higher sales volume, mainly in our retail segment.
Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the fiscal '22 first quarter was 25.9% versus 19.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
Absent discrete adjustments, our effective tax rate would have been 25.3% and 26.1% in the first quarters of fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively.
We expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2022 year to be between 25.5% and 26.5%.
Turning to cash, we generated $6 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter.
We invested $39 million in higher inventory levels to protect against supply chain disruptions and support increased production in delivered sales.
We also spent $19 million in capital, primarily related to improvements to our retail stores, upgrades at our manufacturing and distribution facilities, new upholstery manufacturing capacity in Mexico, and technology upgrades.
We ended the period with $336 million in cash and no debt compared with $337 million in cash at the end of fiscal 2021 first quarter, which included $50 million in cash proactively drawn on our credit facility.
In addition, we held $33 million in investments to enhance returns on cash, compared with $16 million last year.
Regarding cash returned to shareholders, during the quarter we continued to aggressively buy back shares, spending $36 million repurchasing more than 900,000 shares of stock in the open market under our existing, authorized share repurchase program.
Over the past two quarters, we have returned $79 million to shareholders via share repurchase.
We also paid $7 million in dividends to shareholders in the last quarter.
Earlier this week, demonstrating its confidence in the Company's ability to grow profitably and continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, the Board of Directors approved an increase of 6.5 million shares to the Company's existing share repurchase authorization, with a 2.5 million shares available for repurchase under the program as of the end of the fiscal 2022 first quarter.
This increase brings the total share repurchase authorization to $9 million, representing approximately -- I'm sorry, 9 million shares, representing approximately 20% of shares outstanding.
This equates to approximately $320 million at Monday's closing stock price.
Additionally, the Board approved a dividend of $0.15 per share to shareholders of record as of September 2nd, 2021.
Finally, as we make investments in the business to strengthen the Company for the future, we expect capital expenditures to be in a range of $65 million to $75 million for fiscal 2022.
