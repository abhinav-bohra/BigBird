On a year-over-year basis, Specialty Solutions revenue decreased approximately 17.8% to $22.8 million and operating income of $3.2 million or a 26% year-on-year decrease.
Supporting this outlook, our backlog realizable under a year increased sequentially approximately $3.5 million for 35% compared to Q1 fiscal 2021, reflecting ongoing recovery in food service equipment and refuse end markets.
From a strategy standpoint, our emphasis on shifting hydraulics manufacturing capacity toward higher-margin aftermarket opportunities continues with aftermarket revenue increasing 15% year-on-year.
