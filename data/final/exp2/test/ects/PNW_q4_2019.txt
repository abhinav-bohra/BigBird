Clean is about decarbonizing our generation mix with our new goal to deliver 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050.
First, we recently announced our goal to deliver 100% clean carbon-free electricity to customers by 2050.
This goal includes a near-term target of 65% clean energy with 45% coming from renewables by 2030 and a commitment to exit coal by 2031.
Supporting an internal culture focused on reducing costs and maintaining a financially strong company to access low cost capital are also key in delivering a 100% clean energy future affordably.
We finished 2019 with our best-ever reliability performance, if you exclude outages from voluntary proactive fire mitigation efforts, and Palo Verde once again achieved a capacity factor above 90%.
Our goal to reach 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050 is new, but our efforts to move toward a cleaner energy mix are not.
Notably, APS was one of 10 American companies and the only U.S. utility to make CDP's A List for both climate change and water security in 2019.
And we accomplished all this while reducing the average residential bill by 7.8% or $11.68 on average since January of 2018 due primarily to savings from federal tax reform and operating cost savings that have been passed on to customers.
The 242 megawatt Clear Creek wind farm in Missouri and the 250 megawatt Nobles 2 wind farm in Minnesota.
First, to the team at Palo Verde for their work on a short notice outage at Unit 3 in getting the necessary work done safely and the unit back online ahead of schedule.
And third, to the Arizona State Sun Devils for their win last night over 14 Oregon.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, we earned $0.57 per share compared to $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.
For the full-year 2019, we earned $4.77 per share compared to $4.54 per share in 2018.
2019 earnings reflect our growing infrastructure to support the strong Phoenix economy and 2% customer growth.
Other key items for 2019 was negative weather, which decreased gross margin by $37 million or $0.25 per share.
Year-over-year lower adjusted O&M expense increased earnings $0.52 per share, primarily driven by lower planned outage expenses and lower public outreach costs at the parent level.
As a result of our cost management efforts, we made great strides in reducing O&M in 2019, allowing us to reach the low end of our original guidance range, despite the mildest Metro Phoenix cooling season on 10 years.
We expect to continue our cost savings efforts by reducing O&M approximately $20 million in 2020.
As Jeff mentioned in his comments, we are on a path to deliver 100% clean carbon-free electricity.
Our 2022 capex forecast reflects nearly $800 million of investment related to new clean generation resources and reflects our conservative mix of owned resources.
While the exact amount has not yet been determined, we would expect the amount to be in the $300 million to $400 million range.
In 2020, we expect to issue up to $1 billion of term debt at APS and $450 million that Pinnacle West.
In the fourth quarter, APS issued $300 million of new 30-year unsecured debt at 3.5%.
We used the proceeds to repay commercial paper and to fund a $100 million of our $250 million par value 2.2% notes which matured in mid-January.
At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had a $115 million of short-term debt outstanding and APS had no short-term debt outstanding.
Due to the tax benefits associated with both the TEAM Phase II and Phase III and optimized use of income tax incentives, our effective tax rate for 2019 was a negative 2.9%.
We anticipate an effective tax rate in 2020 of 14%.
The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 97% as of year-end 2019.
Arizona's population grew by approximately 120,000 people between July 2018 and July 2019.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.9% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 9.6% and manufacturing employment increased by 5.2%.
In 2020, we expect a total of 31,100 housing permits, driven by both single-family and multifamily permits.
We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated earnings for 2020 to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share.
A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance can be found on Slide 6 and 7.
In closing, our long-term rate base growth outlook remains intact at 6% to 7% and we expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% in 2020.
