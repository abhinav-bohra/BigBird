First, we have lowered our expectation for the normative 10-year treasury yield to 2.75%, a reduction of 100 basis points from last year.
Second, we extended the time period to grade up to that normative rate from six years to 10 years.
Our underlying combined ratio of 92.6% for the quarter improved by 2 points from a year ago and is the lowest underlying combined ratio for CNA in the last 10 years.
The underlying loss ratio improvement consisted of only 0.5 point benefit due to lower frequency from the ongoing economic downturn, with most of the improvement driven by our International business, which has steadily returned to profitability as a result of our reunderwriting efforts in our London operation over the last 18 months.
The lower P&C expense ratio of 31.8% largely reflected our growing premium base, which contributed approximately 0.7 points of the improvement in our underlying combined ratio.
Turning to the dynamics of this hard market and starting with pricing, rate increases continued to accelerate as we achieved plus 12% in P&C overall, up 1 point from the second quarter.
Importantly, excluding workers' comp, which had slightly negative rate and our very profitable Affinity Programs, which had a small positive rate increase, the rate change was plus 17%, up 2 points from Q2 and 5 points from Q1.
The acceleration in our written rate increases over the last six quarters has led to four quarters of earned rate increases, now at plus 9%.
This compares to our long-run loss cost trend assumptions of slightly more than 4%, excluding our Affinity book.
In terms of growth, gross written premium, ex-captives, grew 9%, while net written premium growth was 7%, both higher than the second quarter.
Exposure continued to be a headwind to our growth as it was down 3 points compared to the third quarter last year.
Retention declined 1 point from the second quarter to 82%, due to our reunderwriting efforts in our London operations, which will essentially be completed in the fourth quarter and to our targeted actions in the US to improve the profitability of certain lines within healthcare and manufacturing that I have spoken about previously.
Completing the picture for the quarter, our overall combined ratio was 100.9%, which included 0.4 points of favorable development and 8.7 points of loss activity from a series of natural catastrophe events.
As a result, our previously established COVID-19 ultimate loss estimate of $195 million remains appropriate for all events that occurred through the third quarter, from which we believe claims will eventually emerge and our loss estimate is still virtually all in IBNR.
Finally, our core income for the third quarter was $193 million or $0.71 per share.
Net income was $213 million or $0.79 per share.
Starting with Specialty, the combined ratio was 89.5% this quarter.
The combined ratio includes favorable prior-period development of 2 points and 1 point from catastrophe losses.
The underlying combined ratio for Specialty was 90.5% this quarter, 1.6 points of improvement compared to third quarter 2019.
The underlying loss ratio was 60%, and the expense ratio was 30.5%.
The expense ratio has improved by 1.3 points compared to third quarter 2019, due to both growth in net earned premium and lower expenses.
The gross written premium growth ex-captives was plus 11% in Specialty for the quarter and was 9% on net written premium.
Rates continued to increase at plus 13%, up from 11% last quarter.
Retention was 86% this quarter, which was flat to last quarter.
New business volume was strong with growth of 14% over the prior year's quarter.
The combined ratio for Commercial was 111.5% this quarter, which is 9.9 points higher than third quarter 2019 and includes 17 points of catastrophe losses and 0.6 points of unfavorable prior-period development.
The underlying combined ratio for Commercial was 93.9% this quarter, 0.1 points higher than the third quarter of 2019, but 0.9 points improvement on a year-to-date basis versus prior.
The underlying loss ratio was 61%, compared to 61.5% in the prior year, reflecting a modest benefit from lower frequency in the quarter as Dino mentioned.
The expense ratio was 32.3% compared to 31.7% in the third quarter 2019.
Gross written premium growth ex-captives was plus 7% in Commercial for the quarter and net was plus 4%.
The rate change of 11% was up 1 point from last quarter.
New business growth was down 3% versus prior quarter and up 8% on a year-to-date basis.
The combined ratio for International was 98.1% this quarter compared to 107.4% in the third quarter 2019.
The combined ratio includes 3 points of catastrophe losses for the quarter.
The underlying combined ratio for International was 95% this quarter, an improvement of 10.3 points compared to prior-year quarter.
The underlying loss ratio was 60.1%, and the expense ratio was 34.9%.
The underlying loss ratio improved 7.2 points, fueled by a reunderwriting execution, while expense ratio declined 3.1 points, driven by lower acquisition and underwriting expenses.
The gross written premium in International increased by 5% and net increased by 10%, both in comparison to the prior year.
Rate change of 16% was up 2 points from prior quarter.
Retention was 70% this quarter, which is in line with 2019 levels and reflects the progression of the reunderwriting strategy.
These changes associated with the discount rate are detailed in Slides 14 and 15.
In the previous two year's reserve reviews, we have reduced our expectations for the normative 10-year treasury yield by 105 basis points.
At our 2019 review, assuming that this benchmark rate will get to 3.75% by 2025, in light of the current interest rate environment and expectation with conditions persisting, we've taken several critical actions on our discounted assumptions.
First, we have lowered our expectation for the normative rate at 2.75%, a reduction of 100 basis points from last year and 205 basis points cumulatively over the last three years.
Second, we've extended the time period to grade up to a normative rate from six years to now 10 years.
This means that it's not until 2030 that we will assume the new 2.75% normative rate.
You will see on Slide 15 that we're not assuming the tenure will get back to the 2% level until 2027, a significant change compared to our prior-year expectations.
The sum of all the assumption changes on the discount rate resulted in an unfavorable pre-tax impact of $609 million.
This change impacts our assumption for cost of care for future claims and together with other morbidity assumptions, had a favorable pre-tax impact of $51 million.
Persistency changes had a favorable pre-tax impact of $152 million.
Over the past year, our actual rate achievement has exceeded our prior-year expectations, contributing $200 million of favorable impacts.
We are updating our assumptions to reflect our actual rate achievement in addition to the updates to existing programs at a total favorable pre-tax impact of $318 million.
And I should note that the weighted average duration to future rate increase approvals assuming annual reserves is only 1.5 years.
Overall, and as highlighted on Slide 17, our annual GPV analysis for long-term care [Indecipherable] reserve deficiency and charged earning of $74 million on a pre-tax basis.
The impact from this review is favorable with a $37 million release of reserves, driven by lower expected claim severity, specifically with we reserved higher claim closure rates, most notably driven by claim recoveries.
Total reserves for our structured settlement block were approximately $550 million at the end of the third quarter.
As part of our reserve review this year, we made adjustments to both the discount rate and mortality assumptions, resulting in a reserve strengthening of $46 million on a pre-tax basis.
Overall, our Life & Group segment produced a core loss of $35 million in the quarter, with some of the reserve changes coming in both the long-term care and structured settlement blocks with a pre-tax charge of $83 million or $65 million after-tax.
With the efforts from the impacts of these reserve reviews, the segment produced core income from current operations of $30 million for the third quarter.
Our Corporate segment produced a core loss of $19 million in the third quarter.
Pre-tax net investment income was $517 million in the third quarter, compared with $487 million in the prior quarter.
The results reflected favorable returns from our limited partnership and common equity portfolios, which produced pre-tax income of $71 million compared to $18 million during the same period last year.
Pre-tax net investment income from our fixed income portfolio was $443 million this quarter, compared to $462 million in the prior-year quarter.
The pre-tax effective yield on our fixed income holdings was 4.5% in the period.
Pre-tax net investment gains for the quarter were $27 million, compared to a gain of $7 million in the prior-year quarter.
The gain was primarily driven by the continued recovery of the mark-to-market on our non-redeemable preferred stock investments and higher net realized investment gains on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a loss on the redemption of our $400 million of senior notes due August 2021.
Our unrealized gain position on our fixed income portfolio stood at $5 billion, up from $4.4 billion at second quarter.
Fixed income assets that support our P&C liabilities had an effective duration of 4.5 years at quarter-end, in line with portfolio targets.
At quarter-end, shareholders' equity was $12 billion or $44.30 per share, driven by the increase in our unrealized gain position during the quarter.
Shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, was $11.6 billion or $42.78 per share.
As I noted in August, we issued $500 million of senior notes at a record low coupon of 2.05%, with tremendous demand for the paper and we subsequently redeemed our 2021 debt, a net of which will reduce our annual interest expense by nearly $13 million.
In the third quarter, our operating cash flow was strong at $758 million, driven by higher premiums, and to a lesser extent, lower paid losses.
And we are pleased to announce our regular quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share.
