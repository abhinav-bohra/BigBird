Fourth quarter revenue grew over 14% to $1.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 23%, representing a great finish to our fiscal 2021 year, where revenue of $6.2 billion was accompanied by an adjusted earnings per share increase of 47% to $3.58.
I'm pleased with the progress we've made in enhancing our overall profitability as full year adjusted EBITDA margins reached a record 7.3% and fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins increased 40 basis points from prior year.

For fiscal 2022, we forecast GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.05 to $2.30 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.30 to $3.55.
Within this guidance, we assume an easing of COVID related disinfection services and work orders, leading us to project fiscal '22 adjusted EBITDA margins of 6.2% to 6.6%, inclusive of synergies from Able Services acquisition.
While earnings per share and margins are projected to decline from fiscal 2021, they are significantly above pre-pandemic levels and above our targeted long-term metrics we outlined in 2019 when we signaled an aspirational margin range of 5.5% to 6%.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.2% to $1.7 billion, primarily driven by one month of contribution from the acquisition Able Services, continued client demand for disinfection services and a generally improving economic environment.
GAAP income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $34.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $53.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the same period last year.
The decrease in GAAP income reflects higher operating and corporate expenses, which included acquisition related costs of $19.7 million, initial investments in our Elevate initiative and a lower benefit from self-insurance adjustments related to prior years.
On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter income from continuing operations grew 25% to $58.2 million or $0.85 per diluted share compared to $46.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year.
Corporate expenses were $40.9 million higher compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to acquisition-related expenses, a lower benefit from prior year self-insurance adjustments and costs related to hiring initiatives.

Operating profit in B&I declined 3% to $82.1 million from the same period last year, reflecting an easing in higher margin work orders.
Aviation revenue increased 43% to $201.7 million, marking the second consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year revenue growth.
Aviation operating profit increased to $13.2 million, compared to $3.5 million in last year's fourth quarter, driven by the significant rebound in revenue as well as our efforts to emphasize higher margin airport facility services.
Revenue within our Technology & Manufacturing segment was essentially flat year-over-year at $245.5 million, as new business starts were offset by reduced client demand for COVID related work orders and EnhancedClean.
However, operating margins for T&M improved to 10% in the fourth quarter, up 40 basis points from last year's fourth quarter benefiting from efficient labor management and contract expansions.
Education revenue declined 3.7% to $204.4 million, largely reflecting the timing of contract rebids.
Operating profit totaled $7.7 million, down from $15.1 million in last year's fourth quarter.
Moving forward, we anticipate Education segment profit margins will be approximately 6% in fiscal 2022, representing an increase of more than 100 basis points compared to pre-COVID levels, resulting from a sustained uplift in labor efficiency and higher disinfection revenue.
Revenue within our Technical Solutions segment grew 21% to [Technical Issues] million, aided by continued strong growth in our emerging electric vehicle charging infrastructure business, improved access to client sites and strengthened client demand for energy efficient solutions.
Segment operating income returned to profitability and generated an operating profit margin of 12.8%.

The substantial increase in demand for disinfecting services combined with our team's continued strong operational execution and drive for labor efficiencies contributed to record adjusted EBITDA margins exceeding 7% in fiscal 2021.
This represents a more than 200 basis point improvement versus pre-COVID adjusted EBITDA margins in fiscal 2019.
While we anticipate an easing of these tailwinds as we emerge from the pandemic, we are confident that we can retain approximately 50 basis points to 70 basis points of uplift over the long-term as we expect to maintain a portion of both the disinfection related revenue and profitability along with a higher baseline level of labor efficiency.
As we build upon the improved positioning gained over the past 18 months, we are guiding to an adjusted EBITDA margin within a range of 6.2% to 6.6%.
This represents a meaningful improvement over our baseline pre-pandemic adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.2% reported in fiscal 2019, but lower than fiscal 2021 as the pandemic tailwinds ease and our business begins to normalize.
Our Elevate strategy includes a series of discrete transformational investments that total between $150 million to $175 million.
By design, the Elevate plan is front-end loaded as we plan to spend approximately $80 million in fiscal 2022 or by approximately $45 million in fiscal '23 and approximately $15 million in each of the following two years.
Of the $80 million planned in fiscal 2022, approximately $72 million will be a discrete expense and will be reported as items impacting comparability and as such will not be included in adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.30 to $3.55.

The remaining 20% will be used to fuel our organic growth initiatives and our go-to-market strategies, including investments in centralized platforms to support capabilities such as hyper sales targeting, price optimization and strategic account management.
Our goal is for Elevate to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate to the mid-single digit range, up approximately 50% versus our previous growth rate with potential upside from additional strategic acquisitions.
As revenue growth accelerates, we also anticipate a corresponding and gradual improvement to our adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 20 basis points annually starting in fiscal 2023.
The related investments are expected to generate $110 million to $130 million in incremental adjusted EBITDA on a run rate basis by fiscal 2025, driving a projected internal rate of return of 28%.
To put this in perspective, at the conclusion of Elevate in fiscal 2025, we envision ABM will generate annual revenue of approximately $9 billion with a sustainable adjusted EBITDA margin of 7%, representing a significant improvement from our baseline level of $7 billion in revenue with a normalized adjusted EBITDA margin below 6%.
We are also targeting annualized free cash flow at a run rate of approximately $400 million by fiscal 2025.
Our goal is to be a roughly $9 billion business with [Technical Issues] sustainable adjusted EBITDA margins by the end of 2025.
From a growth perspective, our investments will drive organic growth rates, almost 50% higher than -- approaching 4% annually.
