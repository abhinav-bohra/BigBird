Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.24.
Our CooperVision growth of 14% was strong and diversified.
We grew nicely in all product categories, spheres, torics and multifocals, and all three regions posted great results, with the Americas up 8%, EMEA up 17% and Asia Pac up 19%.
Regarding products, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay, and clariti, posted strong results, growing 25%.

Our team in China is strong, and our advisory board of key opinion leaders that are affiliated with hospitals representing over 50% of myopia management contact lens volume in China has us positioned for success in a market where childhood myopia rates are estimated to be over 80%, and we're reducing myopia as a priority for the government.
It cuts myopia progression by roughly 59% on average.
To conclude on myopia management, our momentum is strong, and we're still targeting roughly $100 million in sales for this fiscal year.
To wrap up on CooperVision, for calendar Q4, we estimate the global contact lens market grew 10%, with CooperVision growing 16%.
This demand is great, but it's still impacting fit activities such as in the U.S. where new fits are still roughly 8% below pre-COVID levels.
Meanwhile, long-term macro growth trends remain intact with roughly one-third of the world being myopic today and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050.
In the meantime, we had another strong quarter with organic growth of 9%.
We recognized roughly $34 million of revenues in the quarter as this was a stub period with only roughly one and a half months of revenue.
Of this, $23 million was in stem cell storage and $11 million in fertility.
It's tough to get exact growth rates for a stub period, but growth for the business for the full equivalent fiscal quarter was 10%.
We posted sales of $97 million, up a very healthy 27% when excluding Generate and the small acquisition of Embryo Options from last January.
Within our office and surgical unit, we posted sales of $129 million, up 24% as reported, but down 3% when excluding Generate and other acquisitions.
Having said that, we did see growth in many areas such as our laparoscopic surgery closure products, and our acquired businesses grew nicely, especially Fetal Pillow in our labor and delivery area, which grew 160%.
This industry continues to grow nicely, and we estimate our addressable market is approaching $2 billion with 5% to 10% long-term annual growth.
It's estimated that one in eight couples has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors such as increasing maternal age and that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility.
First quarter consolidated revenues were $787 million, up 16% and up 13% organically.
Consolidated gross margin decreased year over year by 90 basis points to 66.9%, driven primarily by currency, but also lower sales of PARAGARD, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs at CooperVision.
Operating expenses grew 19% to 42.3% of revenues with the addition of Generate and higher investment activity.
Consolidated operating margins were 24.6%, down from 26.9% last year due to the negative impact of FX and higher investing.
Interest expense was $6.6 million on higher average debt, partially offset by lower interest rates.
The effective tax rate was 13.3%, higher primarily due to the Generate acquisition.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.24 with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding.
FX negatively impacted us by $0.37 in the quarter, which was $0.02 worse than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call.

Roughly $256 million remains authorized for repurchase under our program.
Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this would have meant the midpoint for earnings per share would have been roughly $14.35, but currency has moved significantly against us over the past week.

Within this, CooperVision revenue guidance is $2.221 billion to $2.264 billion, up 7% to 9% organically.

Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $13.70 to $14.20.
We estimate interest expense around $42 million, which assumes a 25-basis-point rate increase, remembering that $1 billion of our debt is fixed -- is at fixed rates.
We estimate the full year tax rate to be around 14%.
Regarding currency, on a year-over-year basis, the negative FX headwind is now roughly 3.5% to revenues and roughly 10% negative impact to EPS.
