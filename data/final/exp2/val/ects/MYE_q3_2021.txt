This demand, combined with meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, drove the company to $200 million in net sales and more than 50% revenue growth for a second consecutive quarter.
On organic basis, sales grew 20% compared to the prior year period which marks three consecutive quarters of 20% or more organic growth.
And as such, we are reaffirming our previous 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $1.05 per share.
Net sales were up $68 million, an increase of 51%.
Excluding the impact of the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisitions, organic net sales increased 20% driven by price, which contributed 13%.
Higher volume mix contributed 7%.
Adjusted gross profit increased $7.2 million, while gross margin decreased from 35.6% in the prior year to 27.2% in the third quarter.
Included in cost of sales was a $1.6 million increase related to the LIFO inventory reserve.
Adjusted operating income decreased $3.1 million to $12.5 million due to increased SG&A, driven by the addition of Elkhart and Trilogy along with higher compensation cost and higher professional fees.
Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 20.9% in the third quarter compared to 23.8% in the prior year as we are experiencing the benefits of our overall larger scale on our infrastructure.
Adjusted EBITDA was $17.3 million, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.6%.
And lastly, adjusted earnings per share was $0.23, a decrease of $0.07 or 23% compared to the prior year.
Beginning with Material Handling, net sales increased $63 million or 73%, including the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisition.
On an organic basis, Material Handling net sales increased 26%, driven by favorable price of 18%.
Strong volume mix contributed another 7% and FX, 1%.
Material Handling adjusted operating income decreased $1.3 million or 8% to $15.2 million.
In the Distribution segment, sales increased $5 million or 11%.
Volume mix contributed 6%, resulting from increases across both equipment and supplies and price contributed 5%.
Distribution's adjusted operating income decreased $700,000 to $4.4 million due to an increase in SG&A expenses, which were more than offset higher volume mix and favorable price-to-cost relationship.
Free cash flow was negative $13.8 million compared with positive free cash flow of $16.2 million for the third quarter of 2020.
Cash from operations decreased in the quarter due to increases in working capital, driven by a $14 million and an $8 million increase in accounts receivable and inventory, respectively, combined with a $3 million decrease in trade accounts payable.
Additionally, capital expenditures were $6 million in the quarter.
Year-to-date free cash flow was essentially flat, down $700,000.
Cash on hand at quarter end was $15 million.
We ended the third quarter with leverage at 1.8 times.
We anticipate net sales to increase in the mid- to high 40% range attributed to both organic growth and acquisitions.
Our previous sales guidance was in the mid-40% range.
Elkhart's annual net sales at the time of acquisition were approximately $100 million and Trilogy's annual net sales were roughly $35 million.
Taking these considerations into account, we are reaffirming our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $0.90 to $1.05 per share.
Our guidance reflects a weighted average share count of 36.5 million shares and the addition of the newly acquired Trilogy business.
Our key modeling assumptions include depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $22 million and capex of approximately $16 million to $19 million, up slightly from our previous capex guidance of $15 million to $18 million.
The effective tax rate is forecast to approximate 26%.
As we continue to execute the remainder of Horizon 1, we'll have the necessary foundation, knowledge and track record to move into Horizon two.
E-commerce is showing encouraging results with year-to-date sales up approximately 30%.
As a reminder, the integration of Elkhart has also gone well, helping us better serve our customers and capture growth synergies and $4 million to $6 million of cost synergies, both of which exceed expectations.
