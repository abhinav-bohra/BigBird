In fact, hotel RevPAR was within 20% of the comparable quarter in 2019 with 12 of our 31 hotels actually exceeding the comparable quarter results in 2019, and five hotels setting all-time highs.
Our portfolio took nearly 1,300 basis points of RevPAR index from our competitors in the third quarter.
In total, this powerful combination enabled DiamondRock to generate a healthy $38.9 million of adjusted EBITDA and $0.10 of positive adjusted FFO per share.
We saw BT revenue jumped to 84% of the comparable 2019 levels with occupancy up 26 percentage points over the second quarter.
Encouragingly, business transient ADR was just 1% below Q3 2019 levels.
Lead generation in the third quarter grew to over 12,400 leads, representing over 2.1 million future room nights.
July was the best month for lead volume with over 750,000 room nights.
Our Vail Resort accessioned $40 million repositioning.
We expect the repositioning to allow us to push average rate by $15 and to generate several million dollars of incremental retail and bar sales.
These ROI repositionings are expected to deliver IRRs north of 30%.
As a testament to DiamondRock's track record, I'm proud to announce that The Gwen was named in Conde Nast Travelers 2021 Readers Choice Awards as the number 1 hotel in Chicago, and number 8 in the world.
In fact, the Destin Beach Resort, that deal is now tracking to be an 8.8% cap rate on 2021 NOI.

Average daily rate was over $300 per night and among the 10 best in the portfolio.
Our pair hotels in Key West continued to deliver strong performance with third quarter EBITDA margins 3,000 basis points above 2019 levels.
I must recognize the Henderson Park Inn, our newest acquisition for beating our underwriting with the third highest total RevPAR in the quarter, $777 a night, $777s.
Third quarter would have been even better, if not for the impact of wildfires in Northern California, which forced a six-week closure at The Landing at Lake Tahoe and resulted in $1.8 million of lost profit.
Third quarter wages and benefits were 30.4% of revenue, just 50 basis points higher than 2019 owing to a 2% improvement in man hours per occupied room.
This is how we held gross operating profit flow-through at a constant 45% in the third quarter versus the second quarter and why comparable third quarter hotel EBITDA margins were up over 300 basis points from the second quarter.
Group revenue on the books for 2022 increased 14% from the second quarter, an acceleration from 8% in Q2.
Group revenue on the books for 2022 is now nearly 50% above the forecast for 2021.
Group rates for 2022 are $50 a night higher than 2021 year-to-date, owing to the fact many of DiamondRock's key group markets like Boston, Chicago, San Diego and Phoenix have strong convention calendars next year.
Across the entire portfolio, citywide room nights for 2022 increased 7% from the second quarter.
And compared to 2019, citywide room nights for Boston, Chicago and San Diego collectively are up 3% in 2022 and up 5% in 2023.
This benefit is amplified by last year's conversion of nearly 20% of our portfolio from Marriott brand management, which should add over 50 basis points of portfolio margin expansion alone.
There is no better evidence than stealing nearly 1300 basis points of share last quarter.
