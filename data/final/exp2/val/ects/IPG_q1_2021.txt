First quarter organic net revenue growth was 1.9%.
That reflects solid performance in the U.S., an organic decrease of 20 basis points, and strong international growth of 6.3%, with increases in every world region.
In the U.S., you'll recall that we are comparing to very strong underlying performance in the first quarter of 2020 when we faced headwinds of nearly 4% due to certain 2019 client losses that we previously identified.
Our international performance was paced by 12.4% growth in Continental Europe, where we had a strong start to the year by our media, data and tech offerings as well as McCann Worldgroup.
From the standpoint of our operating segments, Our IAN segment grew 3.2% organically, led by media, data and technology and by the healthcare specialty agencies.
We continue to be highly confident that, over time, we are well positioned to realize the full level of permanent operating expense savings that we've talked about previously, which, as a reminder, annualized at $160 million.
Our first quarter net income as reported was $92 million, which includes the expense of certain nonoperating items.
Our adjusted EBITA was $266 million, a level which is approximately 2.5 times the first quarters of recent years.
Our adjusted EBITA margin was 13.1%.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and was $0.45 as adjusted mainly for our loss on the early extinguishment of debt, the disposition of certain small nonstrategic agencies, both of which are nonoperating expenses, and our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles.
Given our strong start to the year, and based on the assumption that there'll continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year in the range of 5% to 6%.
With that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 15.5%.
First quarter adjusted EBITDA, before a small restructuring adjustment, was $265.9 million and margin was 13.1%.
Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and $0.45 as adjusted.

Continental Europe grew 12.4%, with increases in every major national markets, including Spain, Germany, Italy and France, driven by increased spend from existing clients.

To the right of that, our pre-tax loss due to the early extinguishment of debt was $74 million, which relates to the refinancing and extending the maturities of $1 billion of our senior notes.
At the front of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of each of these adjustments, which bridges our diluted earnings per share as reported at $0.23 to adjusted earnings of $0.45 per diluted share.
