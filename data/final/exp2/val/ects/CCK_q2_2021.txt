Earnings for the quarter were $0.95 per share compared to $0.94 in the prior year quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.14 in the quarter compared to $1.33 in 2020.
Net sales in the quarter were up 34% from the prior year primarily due to increased volumes across all segments, favorable foreign currency translation, and the pass-through of higher material cost.
Segment income improved to $395 million in the quarter compared to $250 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales unit volumes including recovery in many locations affected by COVID in last year's second quarter.
As outlined in the release, we currently estimate third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of between $1.90 and $2 per share.
We are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings guidance from $6.70 per share to $7.35 per share again assuming the sale of the Europe Tinplate business closes at the end of August.
Our expected adjusted tax rate for the full year remains at 24% to 25%.
Average segment income from continuing operations over the last four quarters, or last 12 months June 2021 is approximately $100 million per quarter higher than the average of the four preceding quarters or LTM June 2020, with approximately $60 million of that income growth found in the Americas Beverage segment, clearly a step change in our earnings outlook.
Had the business been included in continuing operations, LTM June EBITDA would have approximated $2.1 billion.
Before reviewing the operating segments, we remind you that delivered aluminum in North America is approximately 65% higher today than at this time last year.
In Americas Beverage demand remained strong across all the markets we serve with overall segment volumes up 18% compared to the second quarter of 2020.
First half '21 versus first half '19 volumes advanced 19%.
Unit volumes in European Beverage advanced 28% over the prior year second quarter, and 14% for the first half compared to the first half of 2019.
Asia-Pacific recorded 15% volume growth in the quarter, and 8% for the first half versus the first half of 2019, as most operations across Southeast Asia were able to grow despite numerous COVID lockdowns and movement control orders.
Segment income, and adjusted earnings in the first half up 50% to 60% over the prior year, and leverage at 3.6 times after repurchasing $300 million of company common stock is ahead of plan.
