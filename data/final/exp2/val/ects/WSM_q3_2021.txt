We continue to be confident in our outlook of at least mid- to high single-digit comps, accelerating our revenues to 10 billion by 2024, with operating margins at least that of fiscal 2021.
95% of our products are proprietary or exclusive to our brands.
We have a vertically integrated digital first but not digital-only operating model that is nearly 70% e-commerce in an industry that primarily consists of brick-and-mortar or pure e-commerce players, and we are a sustainable and values-led company.

Gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 43.7%.
Our selling margins drove 280 basis points of this expansion.
And relative to 2019, our selling margins are up 430 basis points, in line with our first half results, despite higher ocean freight costs incurred during the quarter.
Occupancy cost leverage was also a factor in our gross margin expansion, leveraging approximately 90 basis points, resulting from higher sales and low occupancy dollar growth.
Occupancy costs were approximately $183 million, up 5.1% year over year and relatively in line with our second quarter growth.
SG&A in the third quarter was in line with the prior quarters at 27.5% of net revenue.

The strength of our business has generated operating cash flow of almost $790 million year to date, which is approximately $60 million over last year's elevated cash flow levels.

Moving down the balance sheet, merchandise inventories, which includes inventory and transit, were $1.272 billion, representing an increase of 13% over last year.

We are raising our 2021 outlook to reflect revenue growth from high teens to low 20s to now 22% to 23%, and operating margins from 16% to 17% to now 16.9% to 17.1%.
Additionally, we are also reiterating our longer-term outlook of revenues accelerating to $10 billion by 2024, with operating margins at least in line with our raised fiscal year '21 levels, which implies at least a mid- to high single-digit comp with margins at least holding over the next three-plus years.
We saw comps accelerating even before the pandemic as a result of our growth initiatives to a tie the 10% comp in February 2020.
And our results every quarter this year have halted a two-year comp of approximately 40%, despite accelerating tougher year-over-year compares.
