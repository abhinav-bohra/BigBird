This compares to previous guidance of 15%.
We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $33.35 to $33.40, which is a growth rate of 30%.

For the full year 2022, based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 6% and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $37.25 to $37.65.
Using the midpoint of 2021 guidance, this reflects a growth rate of 12% to 13%.

In 2022, other income, which is below operating profit, will amount to approximately $13.5 million.

In terms of free cash flow for 2021, we now estimate it will reach $810 million, which reflects a 29% growth on a per share basis.
For 2022, we would estimate free cash flow in the range of $845 million.
Once we get beyond 2022, we expect free cash flow per share will grow in line with earnings per share and net income conversion will be in the 100% range.

In 2022, we would expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 1%.
In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 4% in 2021 and be a slight headwind to adjusted earnings per share growth in 2022.
An additional nice development within our Lab business is that we obtained a $36 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to expand our pipette tip production in California.
