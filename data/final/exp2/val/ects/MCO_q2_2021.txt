Financial institutions revenue rose 6%, above the 1% increase in issuance.
Revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance declined 2% compared to a 45% decrease in issuance as increased non-U.S. project and infrastructure activity was offset by a reduction in U.S. infrastructure supply.
Structured finance revenue increased 73%, supported by an over 200% growth in issuance.
This is due to approximately 200 CLO deals this quarter, our highest on record, predominantly attributable to refinancing activity.

Our full year 2021 guidance is underpinned by the following macro assumptions: a rise in the 2021 U.S. and euro area GDP to a range of 6% to 7% and 4% to 5%, respectively; benchmark interest rates will remain low, with U.S. high-yield spreads remaining below approximately 500 basis points; the U.S. unemployment rate will decline to under 5% by year-end; and the global high-yield default rate will fall below 2% by year-end.
Specifically, our forecast for the balance of 2021 reflects U.S. exchange rates for the British pound of $1.38 and $1.19 for the euro.
Given our improved revenue outlook and expense stability, we now project Moody's adjusted operating margin to be approximately 51%.
We raised the diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges to $10.95 to $11.25 and $11.55 to $11.85, respectively.
We increased our free cash flow forecast to be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion.
And we anticipate full year share repurchases to remain at approximately $1.5 billion subject to available cash, market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation.
We are raising our issuance forecast for leveraged loans to be up approximately 75% and for high-yield bonds to be up approximately 25%.
These are meaningful increases compared to our prior outlook of up 55% and approximately flat, respectively, and is the result of better-than-expected second quarter issuance as well as ongoing favorable refinancing conditions and heightened M&A activity.
We expect that the increase in leveraged loan supply will continue to drive CLO creation and are therefore also improving the structured issuance outlook to be up approximately 75%.
Following a very active 2020, full year investment-grade supply is now forecast to decrease by approximately 40%.
That's slightly lower than our previous guidance, which anticipated volumes to decline 30%.
Also, after a surge in activity in the second quarter, we are increasing our guidance for new mandates to be in the range of 950 to 1,050.
MIS' adjusted operating margin guidance remains at approximately 61% as our improved top line outlook is partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and an acceleration in ESG, technology and automation investments in the second half of the year.
We are raising MA's adjusted operating margin guidance to be in the range of 30% to 31% as we continue to effectively manage our expense base while accelerating strategic investment back into the business.
