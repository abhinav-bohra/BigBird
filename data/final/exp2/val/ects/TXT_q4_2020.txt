Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $596 million, as compared to $642 million last year.
Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial, and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues.

Looking to Future Vertical Lift, Bell marked the third anniversary of the V-280's first flight in December, with the aircraft having now flown more than 200 hours.
This contract expands the scope of the services we currently provide into the program and it's worth up to $440 million over the next five years.

Segment profit in the quarter was $324 million, down $16 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 on a $368 million decrease in revenues.
Revenues at Textron Aviation of $1.6 billion were down 10%, primarily due to lower Citation jet volume and lower aftermarket volume.
Segment profit was $108 million in the fourth quarter, down from $134 million a year ago, primarily due to the impact from lower volume and mix.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.6 billion.
Moving to Bell, revenues were $871 million, down from $961 million last year, primarily on lower military revenues and commercial volume.
Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $5.3 billion.
At Textron Systems, revenues were $357 million, down from $399 million a year ago, primarily due to lower volume at TRU Simulation and training.
Segment profit of $49 million was up $16 million, primarily due to favorable performance.
Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.6 billion.
Industrial revenues were $866 million, a decrease of $61 million from last year, primarily due to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business within Specialized Vehicles.
Segment profit was $55 million, up 25% from the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a favorable impact from pricing and inflation and favorable performance, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and mix.
Finance segment revenues were $13 million and profit was $2 million.
Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $50 million and interest expense was $36 million.
We recorded pre -- pre-tax special charges of $23 million in the quarter related to restructuring activities.
Following the strong cash performance in the quarter, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet.
The $2.3 billion represents a higher-than-normal level of cash on hand, reflecting a prefunding of $500 million of 2021 debt maturities.
During the quarter, we repaid $350 million of floating rate notes that matured in November and $362 million of outstanding borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance policies that were drawn in the first quarter for additional liquidity.
In the quarter, we also reactivated our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 120 -- 129 million of shares.
At Textron Aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $4.5 billion, reflecting higher aircraft deliveries for both jets and turboprops, as well as, higher aftermarket revenues.
Segment margin is expected to be approximately 5.5%, reflecting the higher volume and increased production.
Looking to Bell, we expect slightly lower revenues of about $3.1 billion, reflecting lower military revenues from a lower H-1 production and aftermarket volume and lower commercial deliveries.
We're forecasting a margin of about 12.5%, largely reflecting the lower military and commercial revenues and increased R&D investments related to FLRAA and FARA.
At Systems, we're estimating higher 2021 rev -- revenues of about $1.4 billion.
Segment margin is expected to be about 12.5%.
At Industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.4 billion, reflecting higher revenues at Kautex and Textron Specialized Vehicles.
Segment margin is expected to be about 6%.
At finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $10 million.
We're estimating 2021 pension income of about $30 million versus a pension cost of $33 million last year.
Our 2021 pension, reflects the strong return on our pension assets for 2020 of 17.4% and a change to the amortization period for accumulated actuarial losses for one of our domestic plans, resulting in those losses being amortized over a longer period.
Offsetting these favorable changes are a 75-basis point decrease in our discount rate to 2.7% and a decrease in our estimated long-term asset return of 50 basis points to 7.25%.
R&D is expected to be about $600 million, up from $545 million in 2020.
We're estimating capex will be about $400 million, up from $317 million last year.
Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we're projecting about $120 million of corporate expense, $135 million of interest expense, and a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 18%.
Our full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.70 to $2.90 per share, which excludes $20 million to $30 million of pre-tax special charges for the completion of our previously announced restructuring plan and a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of TRU Canada.
Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 227 million shares as we continue to deploy the majority of our free cash toward share repurchases in 2021.
