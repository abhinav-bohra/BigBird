We reported 20% higher adjusted earnings per share over '19 and 5% over a very strong first quarter last year before we felt the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Consistent with our track record of strong free cash flow, we also delivered record free cash flow of $125 million in the first quarter, which was up substantially from a very strong performance a year ago.
We had half of our Texas manufacturing facility operational within one week of the storm, and we were more than 95% operational within three weeks.
And our progress hasn't gone unnoticed with Barron's adding Eastman to its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies for 2021, a true honor for us.
Despite these headwinds, we expect a sequential increase in EPS, with second quarter adjusted earnings per share expected to be at or above second quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $2.22.
We expect to continue to benefit from about $100 million of full year tailwind for improved capacity utilization compared to last year when we aggressively managed inventory well below the decline in demand with our focus on cash.
We, therefore, expect adjusted earnings per share will be about -- be between $8.25 and $8.75 for the full year of '21.
On cash, we expect free cash flow to approach $1.1 billion, which is consistent with our expectations for stronger adjusted EBITDA.
We expect 2021 will be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow greater than $1 billion, and we will work to grow free cash flow from here.
