We're making investments in India to further support the market with a newly opened 150,000-plus square foot state-of-the-art center in a suburb of Bangalore.
The new facility will allow us to accommodate planned growth in India as we go from the current level of 900 jobs to approximately 1,500 employees over the next five years.

In 2022, we don't expect pricing will fully offset all cost increases, which will result in a net headwind to gross profit of approximately 100 basis points for the full year.
Once fully executed, we expect the first phase of our transformation program will result in ongoing incremental savings in SG&A of $10 million to $15 million per year.
We're also assessing a second phase of the program, which we're preliminarily planning for 2023, and anticipate that it will result in annualized savings in the same magnitude as Phase 1.

Normalizing for currency, there was sequential improvement in the fourth quarter growth with local currency net sales declining 5.5% versus 7.6% year-over-year decline in the third quarter.
This was driven by sequential improvement in volume growth of 5.7% year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter versus the 8.3% year-over-year decline in the third quarter.

We expect the first phase of this initiative will incur total pre-tax charges in SG&A in the range of $25 million to $30 million.
We carved out approximately $13 million of these charges in 2021, with most remaining expenses to be incurred throughout 2022.
We expect this first phase will result in annual incremental savings in the range of $10 million to $15 million with some savings beginning in 2022 increasing through 2023, with the full impact of the savings expected to begin in 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $165 million to $185 million.
Operating cash flow of $460 million for full-year 2021 was down from 2020, primarily due to the impact of several unfavorable accounts related to year-over-year net sales declines.
After completing just under $1 billion in share repurchases during the year, at the end of 2021, we had just over $600 million of cash on hand.
As I mentioned earlier, we have included a minimum of $50 million in share repurchases per quarter in our guidance for the year, which will cut into the approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our three-year share repurchase authorization.
