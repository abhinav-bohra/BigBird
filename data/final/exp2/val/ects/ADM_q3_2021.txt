Adjusted segment operating profit was $1 billion, up 18% versus the third quarter of 2020 and our 8th consecutive quarter of year-over-year OP growth.
Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.6 billion, almost a $1 billion more than a year ago.
And our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9.6%, significantly higher versus the year-ago period.
So when we talked about the dramatic transformation of our portfolio over the last 10 years, it's not a discrete event.
We are continuing to invest in key nutrition categories as demand for alternative protein grows from $10 billion to $30 billion over the next decade.

In the early of microbiome, we've signed an agreement with Vland Biotech to launch a joint venture that we perfectly positioned to help meet $1 billion in retail demand for probiotics in China.
And yesterday, we announced a memorandum of understanding with Gevo to explore potential joint venture, one of which would include our Columbus and Cedar Rapids dry mills and our ethanol assets indicator transitioning 900 million gallons of ethanol production to support growing demand for low carbon sustainable aviation fuel.
The U.S. and EU have set goals that together with support almost 4 billion gallons of annual sustainable aviation fuel production by 2030 and more than 45 billion by 2050.
These efforts and enable in biosolutions to deliver 10% annualized revenue growth including more than $80 million in new revenue wins in the first nine months of this year and we believe there are many new opportunities to come.
Overall results were significantly lower versus the prior year quarter, driven by approximately $50 million in that timing effects that should reverse in coming quarters, as well as $54 million in insurance settlement recorded in the prior year period, and lower export volumes caused by Hurricane Ida.
Results were also driven by about $70 million in net positive timing effects in the quarter.
Refined Products and Other results were significantly higher than prior year period, driven by positive timing effects of approximately $80 million, our expected to reverse in future quarters.
On Slide 8, the Nutrition business remains on its solid growth trajectory was 17% higher revenues and 15% on a constant currency basis and 20% higher profits year-over-year and continued strong EBITDA margins.
The human nutrition team delivered revenue growth of 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, helping to drive 9% higher profit, higher volume improved pilot mix, particular strength in beverage drove strong flavor results in EMEA in North America, partially offset by lower results in APAC.
Aninal Nutrition profits were nearly double the year-ago period and sales were up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by the strength in the mineral assets as well as feed additives and ingredients, partially offset by higher costs in LATAM and slower demand recovery in APAC.
Looking ahead, we expect nutrition to continue on its impressive growth path with strength across the Human and Animal Nutrition leading to strong year-over-year earnings expansion in the fourth quarter and a 20% full year growth versus 2020.
In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $230 million were driven primarily by higher IT offerings and project-related costs and transverse cost into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operation.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was approximately 18%.
We anticipate our calendar year adjusted effective tax rate to be the upper end of our previously communicated range of 14% through 16% and potentially a bit higher depending upon the geographic mix in the fourth quarter.
Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 26% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion.
And nutrition will continue on its strong growth trajectory in line with our 15% per annum trend rate growth and on its way to $1 billion in operating profit in the coming years.
Of course, there are things we continue to watch including energy costs and inflation more widely and much abilities to meet needs in the enduring trend areas of food security, health and wellbeing and sustainability and a truly unparallel team of nearly 40,000 colleagues around the world, we remain very optimistic in a strong year to come.
