New accounts grew 17% to 6.2 million and average active accounts increased 5% to 67.2 million during the period.
This translated to an 11% increase in purchase volume per active account during the third quarter and 16% growth in total purchase volume compared to last year.
Of course, this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions, leading to a 2% increase in loans, including loans held for sale.
Net interest margin of 15.45% was 165 basis points higher than last year, primarily reflecting the reduction in excess liquidity.
Operating expenses were down 10% compared to last year and down 7% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned.
We remain on track to reduce about $210 million from our expense base by year-end even as we continue to invest in our business.
The efficiency ratio was 38.7% for the quarter largely flat with last year.
Net charge-offs were 2.18% for the third quarter, down 224 basis points from last year.

Turning to our balance sheet, deposits were down $3 billion or 5% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity.
Deposits represented 82% of our funding mix at quarter-end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of debt.

Looking at our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with purchase volume, which grew 16% compared to last year and 16% compared to 2019 excluding Walmart demonstrates clear broad-based strength in consumer demand.

In late August, we reached an agreement for the sale of the Gap portfolio, which led to the reclassification of $3.5 billion of loan receivables to held for sale and therefore reduced our ending loan receivables balance.
Excluding the impact of the reclassification, loan receivables would have increased by 2% versus the prior year as the period's strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate.
Payment rate for the third quarter was approximately 200 basis points higher when compared to the last year.
Interest and fees on loans increased 2% compared to last year, reflecting similar growth in average loan receivables.
Net interest income was 6% higher than last year, primarily reflecting a decline in interest expense due to lower benchmark rates.
RSAs were $1.3 billion in the third quarter and 6.38% of average receivables.
The $367 million year-over-year increase primarily reflected the impact of the lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance including growth and improvement in net interest income.
Now when you think about the combined $1.4 billion year-over-year improvement in net interest income, net losses and the reserve change, we shared $367 million of that through the RSA.
Focusing on our credit performance, provision for losses was $25 million.
Included in this quarter's provision was reserve release of $407 million which incorporated our continued strength in credit performance and we're optimistic macroeconomic environment and the impact of reclassifying our Gap portfolio loan receivables to held for sale.
This resulted in a reserve reduction of approximately $247 million.
Other income decreased $37 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter.
Other expense decreased $106 million compared to the prior year.
As you recall, last year we recognized an $89 million restructuring charge and we continue to see favorability from lower operational losses.
The 10% year-over-year increase in Home & Auto was generally driven by strong retailer performance across almost all verticals while purchase volume in Diversified & Value increased 25% reflecting the continued return to in-person retail experiences.
In Digital, the 21% increase was due to broad-based growth across our partners coupled with growth in our new programs with Verizon and Venmo.
In Health & Wellness, the 10% growth in purchase volume primarily reflected consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing planned procedures.
Meanwhile, purchase volume grew a more modest 2% in lifestyle reflecting broad-based growth across the platform, but having a tough comparable to last year's strong growth in power sports.
Average active account trends ranged on a platform basis up by as much as 10% in Diversified & Value and 7% in Digital while Home & Auto and Health & Wellness average active accounts were generally flat.
Payment rates were approximately 260 basis points higher than our five-year historical average.
That said, we've begun to see some signs of moderation in certain cohorts as payment rate was about 200 basis points higher year-over-year compared to almost 300 basis points higher year-over-year comparison in the second quarter.
Interest and fees were up approximately 2% in the third quarter reflecting [Phonetic] average loan receivable growth.
Net interest income increased 6% from last year reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expense for the period.
The net interest margin was 15.45% compared to last year's margin of 13.8%, a 165 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the mix of interest earning assets and favorable interest bearing liabilities costs.
More specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 550 basis points from 78.3% to 83.8% driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter.
This accounted for 106 basis point increase in our net interest margin.
Interest bearing liabilities costs were 1.31%, a year-over-year improvement of 59 basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rates and funding mix.
This provided a 51 basis point increase in our net interest margin.
The loan receivables yield was 19.59%, a year-over-year improvement of 10 basis points.
This resulted in an 8 basis point improvement in our net interest margin.
Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.42% compared to 2.67% last year.
Our 90 plus delinquency rate was 1.05% compared to 1.24% last year.
It should be noted that removing the impact of the Gap program from the third quarters of this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down about 40 basis points versus 25 basis points and the 90 plus metric would be down about 25 basis points instead of 19 basis points.
And in terms of our portfolio's loss performance, our net charge-off rate was 2.18% compared to 4.42% last year.
Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 11.28%.
