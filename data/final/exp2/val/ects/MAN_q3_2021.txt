The midpoint of our constant currency guidance is 7%.
A minor decrease in billing days in the fourth quarter and the impact of net acquisitions, driven by ettain, impact the growth rate, resulting in an outlook for organic days-adjusted revenue growth of 4% at the midpoint.
This would represent a fourth quarter organic constant currency decline in the range of minus 2% to minus 4% compared to 2019 revenues, representing an improvement from our third quarter trend.
Although final purchase accounting for the ettain acquisition will be finalized in the months ahead, we currently estimate that intangible asset amortization will be approximately $24 million annually.
