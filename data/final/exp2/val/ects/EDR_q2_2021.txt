First, we announced during our last earnings call that we expected to pay down $600 million of debt in the third quarter, part of our continued commitment to reduce leverage.

Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $168 million, up $122 million.
Our Owned Sports Properties segment continued to perform very well, with revenues of $258.9 million, an increase of $106.6 million or 70%.

This growth was primarily driven by an increase in client commissions and project deliveries at Endeavor Content, including episodes of Season 2 of Truth Be Told for Apple TV, The Wall in NBC and Netflix film Blue Miracle.
That slight timing delay, predominantly from three shows, negatively impacted our revenues in the quarter by approximately $90 million.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $61.7 million, an increase of $9.6 million or just over 18% as we realized a higher percentage of revenue growth from Endeavor Content versus clients in the quarter.
Finally, corporate adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $62.7 million, reflecting an increase in costs brought on to support increased activity and investment in the business, as well as those costs associated with being a new public company.
We paid down $600 million of our outstanding debt in Q2, which consisted of the repayment of approximately $163 million under the WME IMG revolving credit facility, which now carries a zero balance; $257 million, representing the entirety of the WME IMG term loan issued in May 2020, which was the highest cost paper in our capital structure; and $180 million of the first lien term loan under the UFC facilities.
Because of these moves, we will realize $35 million in annual interest savings going forward.
We are, therefore, raising our revenue guidance from a prior range of $4.76 billion and $4.83 billion to now between $4.8 billion and $4.85 billion.
And on adjusted EBITDA, we're raising the range from $735 million to $745 million to between $765 million and $775 million.
