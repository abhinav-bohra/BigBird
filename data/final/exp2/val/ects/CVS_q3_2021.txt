While there are still many factors to play out, we believe that current analyst estimates for 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately $8.20 are within our anticipated initial guidance range.
We estimate these factors combined represent approximately $0.40 per share.
Using the midpoint of our updated 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range, which is $7.95, these adjustments create a 2021 baseline of $7.55.
For retail, we expect that COVID-19 vaccine and testing volume, which is expected to generate over $3 billion of revenue in 2021, will decline significantly in 2022 to 30% to 40% of the volume we administered in 2021.
With all of this in mind, the current consensus of analyst estimates of approximately $8.20 for adjusted earnings per share would represent about an 8% increase over the 2021 baseline.
