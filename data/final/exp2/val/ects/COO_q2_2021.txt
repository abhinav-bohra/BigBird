For the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant-currency basis, consolidated revenues were $720 million, with CooperVision at $523 million, up 25%; and CooperSurgical at $197 million, up 58%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.38.
For CooperVision, the Americas grew 38% with clariti, MyDay, and Biofinity leading the way.
EMEA grew 15% in the quarter, led by strength in MyDay and Biofinity.
1 contact lens company in EMEA, so we're obviously over-indexed in this region and the impact from COVID did temper the market's performance.
Lastly, Asia Pac was up 19%, led by strength in clariti and MyDay.
Moving to some details, silicone hydrogel dailies grew 31% with MyDay and clariti both posting strong results.
From a market perspective, there's still roughly $2.4 billion in annual global sales of older daily hydrogels that we expect to be traded up to silicones in the coming years.
We also just announced that we've doubled the number of prescription options for Biofinity Toric and to provide context on how significant this is, Biofinity Toric is the most prescribed toric lens in the world and is now available at over 33,000 prescriptions.
The multifocal category is roughly 10% of the $8.5 billion global contact lens market and roughly half of that is in dailies.
Given we're currently under-indexed in the daily segment at roughly a 16% share, we believe the MyDay Multifocal will be very successful.
Moving to myopia management, our portfolio grew 122% this quarter to $14 million.
Within this, MiSight grew 152% to $4 million, and Ortho K grew 112% to $10 million.
Given the strength we're seeing, we now expect this portfolio to reach $65 million in sales this year and exceed $100 million next year.
Our momentum has been accelerating, including in the U.S., where sales grew sequentially from 100,000 to 700,000, and we're about to launch in South Korea, which should be a great market.
From a fitting perspective, the average age of a new MiSight wearer remains 11, compared to a regular new contact lens wearer of 17, showing this treatment is bringing kids into contact lenses at a much younger age.
On a longer-term basis, the macro growth trends remain solid, with roughly one-third of the world being myopic today, and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2050.
Moving to CooperSurgical, this was an outstanding quarter, with record revenues of $197 million in all three focus areas: fertility, PARAGARD, and office and surgical medical devices outperforming.
Starting with fertility, revenues grew 53% year over year to $84 million, easily becoming the best fertility quarter we've ever had.
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 62%, with PARAGARD up 103% and office and surgical medical devices up 41%.
As the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, the product offers fantastic, long-lasting birth control that addresses the needs and interests of women looking for a healthy alternative.
Our second-quarter consolidated revenues increased 37% year over year or 32% in constant currency to $720 million.
Consolidated gross margin increased year over year to 68.1%, up from 65.8%.
Opex was up 17% year over year as expenses naturally increased with the rebound in revenues, along with higher sales and marketing expenses associated with investments in areas such as myopia management.
Having said that, expenses were kept under control, resulting in consolidated operating margins of 26.8%, up from 17.4% last year.
Interest expense was $6.1 million due to lower interest rates and lower average debt levels and the effective tax rate was 9.6%, driven by a 2.1% benefit from options exercises.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.38 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding.
Free cash flow was very solid at $143 million, comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow, offset by $50 million of capex.
Net debt decreased to $1.6 billion, and our adjusted leverage ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.8 times, driven by lower debt and improving EBITDA.
The first was No7 Contact Lens, a U.K.-based contact lens manufacturer primarily focused on specialty lenses, including Ortho K, that had annual revenue of roughly $4.4 million, which we purchased for roughly $12 million.
OBP Medical had roughly $10 million in annual revenues, and we purchased them for $60 million.
Consolidated revenues are expected to range from $2.855 billion to $2.885 billion, up 14% to 15% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $2.11 billion and $2.13 billion, up 11% to 12% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical revenues between $745 million and $755 million, up 25% to 27% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $13.20 to $13.40.
Given the lower tax rate in Q2, we now expect our full-year tax rate to be around 11%.
And to wrap up on guidance, our business continues to strengthen, and we now expect free cash flow to exceed $500 million this year.
