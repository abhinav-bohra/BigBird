At the peak, nearly 20% of our office network was closed to the public.
Our efforts during this crisis to continue to meet the needs of clients, digitally enable our business, and serve our clients however they want, has led to strong feedback with service quality scores improving 2 points in Assisted and 5 points in DIY building on significant increases in both areas in fiscal '19.
Through June 5, the IRS reported total filings down 6%.
Excluding these returns, we estimate DIY e-files are down approximately 4% compared to Assisted e-files, down 15% through June 5.
Turning to Wave, after posting strong results of over 40% revenue growth through mid-March, we've seen flat revenues in April and May as small businesses were impacted by the pandemic.
In fiscal '20, we recognized revenues of $2.6 billion, representing a 14.7% decline from the prior year, driven by lower tax return volumes as a result of the extension of the federal tax filing deadline, partially offset by the contribution of Wave.
Regarding expenses, total operating expenses increased 3.4%, driven entirely by the impairment of Wave goodwill and Wave's operating expenses.
We recorded a $106 million non-cash goodwill impairment at Wave due to the pandemic and its impact on small businesses.
Turning to the rest of the income statement, interest expense increased by $9 million.
Approximately half of this increase was due to higher draws on our line of credit during the normal course of the business through our fiscal third quarter, while the other half was due to additional interest associated with the $2 billion draw in late March.
The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $3 million.
GAAP earnings per share was positive at $0.03 due to favorable discrete tax items.
Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the impact of the impairment and amortization of intangibles related to Wave and tax office acquisitions, was $0.84.
Our current liquidity position remains strong as we ended the year with $2.7 billion in cash, which includes the full $2 billion drawn on our line of credit.
Our line of credit is subject to various conditions including a covenant, which requires us to maintain a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times on April 30.
I'm pleased to announce that despite the financial impact of COVID-19 and the extended tax season, our Board of Directors has declared a $0.26 per share dividend payable July 1.
We've never missed a dividend payment since going public in 1962.
With respect to share repurchases, in fiscal '20, we repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $24.36.
We expect an increase of approximately $10 million in marketing expense and approximately $10 million in interest expense.
Additionally, we expect variable expenses related to compensation benefits and bad debt to be approximately 40% of incremental Assisted revenues generated.
