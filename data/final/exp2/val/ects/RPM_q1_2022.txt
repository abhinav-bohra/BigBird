After nearly 30 years of distinguished service to RPM.
Combined sales in these three segments increased more than 15% and their adjusted EBIT was up more than 40%.
During this supply disruption, we lost the equivalent of nearly 300 production days across RPM facilities around the globe during the 2022 first quarter.
We estimated the negative impact and consolidated sales during this first quarter was about $200 million due to these challenges and disruptions.
Sales and earnings for our consumer group decreased during the quarter as a result of these factors, as well as a difficult comparison to the prior-year period when sales increased on an organic basis by 34% and adjusted EBIT was up 122%.
Also on this slide, you'll see an image from 178,000 square foot plant we purchased 120 acres in Texas.
From a more long-term macro viewpoint, there are a number of market opportunities in industry trends that we are well-positioned to capitalize on for continued growth and success among the market opportunities on Slide 5 are the following: The increasing need for investment in infrastructure with spending estimated to be $2.8 trillion globally.
Turning to Slide 6, on a consolidated basis, our sales increased to a record $1.65 billion up 2.7% over a strong fiscal 2021 first quarter, which grew 9.1%.
The growth was 2.1% from recent acquisitions and 1.6% due to foreign currency translation tailwinds.
More than offsetting in organic sales declines of 1%.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share of a dollar rate decreasing 25% compared to the prior-year periods extraordinary adjusted diluted earnings per share growth approved 52%.
Our consolidated adjusted EBIT of 206.8 million decreased 23.2% due to supply chain challenges, inflation, and consumer groups' tough comparison against the prior year.
Its organic growth at 15% was particularly impressive given that non-residential construction put in place a relevant market indicator for the segment is down 11.6% this calendar year.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, this segment experienced a negative sales impact of roughly $100 million from production outages due to supply constraints and disruptions.
However, the consumer groups' fiscal 2020 to first-quarter sales were 12.3% above pre-pandemic levels of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in spite of the negative sales impact from supply chain challenges during the current year.
In addition, we face another difficult comparison to the prior year when sales on a consolidated basis increased 6% and adjusted EBIT increased nearly 30%, driven by a 66% increase in the consumer segments adjusted EBIT.
Our consumer group is anticipated to experience a double-digit decrease in sales due to continued raw materials shortages and a difficult comparison to the prior-year period when pandemic fuels demand rapidly drove organic growth up 15%.
So adjusted EBIT is expected to be down 15% to 25%.
