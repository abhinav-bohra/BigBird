We reported second quarter revenue of $43.2 million and a loss per share of $0.45.
For the year-to-date, we had revenue of $112.2 million and a loss per share of $0.34.
Revenue for the year-to-date was 2% lower than our figure from last year when we had a slow first half that was followed by a strong second half.
We continue to estimate our annual tax rate will be in the mid-20% range after adjusting for the impact of charges relating to the vesting of restricted stock, which is consistent with our prior guidance.
We ended the quarter with $92.5 million of cash and $306.9 million of debt and we paid down another $15 million of that debt after quarter end.
We also declared our usual $0.05 quarterly dividend.
And lastly as of quarter end, we have bought back 1.5 million shares and share equivalents for a total cost of $23.8 million and had an additional $26.2 million of repurchase authority available for the year ahead through next January.
