In addition, noting our confidence in the business, we are pleased to announce a $0.06 increase in our quarterly dividend and an increase in our share repurchase authorization, which will continue to support our ongoing share repurchase program.
For example, we believe we are the largest provider of artificial intelligence services to the federal government with 60% year-over-year revenue growth in our AI services portfolio, albeit from a small base.
With less than one-quarter remaining in the three-year time horizon of our investment thesis, we are on track to deliver greater than 80% growth in ADEPS against an already ambitious 50% goal we originally set in June of 2018.
Revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses increased 3% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year.
Revenue in defense grew 6% year-over-year, against a challenging third quarter comparable.
In civil, revenue growth was 7% in the third quarter.
Revenue from our intelligence business declined 3% in the third quarter.
Lastly, Q3 revenue in global commercial, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenue, declined 35% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with 27,566 employees, an increase of 390 or 1.4% year-over-year.
Excluding the impact of the 110-person workforce transferred as a part of the army-related contract divestiture, we would have ended the quarter with 1.8% headcount growth year-over-year.
On Slide 7, you'll see that total backlog increased 6.1% to $23.3 billion.
Funded backlog was up 2.8% to $3.6 billion, unfunded backlog grew 12.5% to $6 billion and price options rose 4.3% to $13.7 billion.
Our book-to-bill for the quarter was 0.3 times, and our last 12 months book-to-bill was 1.2 times.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $205 million, up 7.7% year-over-year.
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.8%.

As of January 26, with the $400 million increase, we now have a total authorization of $747 million.
In addition, the company has authorized a dividend of $0.37 per share payable on March 2 to stockholders of record on February 12.
With $1.3 billion in cash on hand, we continue to view our balance sheet as a strategic asset.
For the full fiscal year, revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 4.8% to 6%.
Our revised range reflects $150 million to $250 million of revenues tied to the second half uncertainties we outlined earlier, the election, the budget and COVID-19.
Temporary programmatic shifts of $50 million to $100 million, $50 million of risk tied to a material incremental step down in staff utilization, and lastly, lower than forecast billable expenses of $50 million to $100 million, largely from lower pandemic-related travel.
We expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to be in the mid-to-high 10% range.
We have raised the range for adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.10 to between $3.70 and $3.85.
On operating cash, we have raised the range by $25 million to between $625 million and $675 million for the full year.
And finally, our outlook for capital expenditures is unchanged at $80 million to $100 million.
We have confidence in exceeding 80% ADEPS growth over the three-year period.
This growth is supported by 6% to 9% annualized revenue growth since fiscal year 2018 at mid-to-high 10% EBITDA margins in fiscal year 2021.
We also are proud of our option value initiatives over the period and our progress toward $1.4 billion in capital deployment.
