In addition to the solid performance in our two reporting segments, our balance sheet remains strong, with net leverage at 1.8 times and total net debt of less than $1 billion.
Our strong second quarter gives us the confidence to affirm the range of our 2021 guidance for adjusted earnings per share and of $3.75 to $4.25 and adjusted EBITDA of $450 million to $500 million as well as affirm our previously issued 2022 guidance.
We're maintaining our expectations for adjusted earnings per share in 2021 to be in a range of $3.75 to $4.25 and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $450 million to $500 million.
Starting with the top line, revenue for the second quarter was $2.5 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year.
This represents 38% growth with strong performance in both of our segments.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 16.1%, an improvement of 117 basis points over prior year due to revenue mix from higher margin sales in the Global Products segment and patient direct business, timing of the pass-through of glove costs and improved operating efficiency.
Also compared to Q1, gross margin was lower by nearly 300 basis points due to margin compression in gloves as anticipated and discussed last quarter.
Distribution, selling and administrative expense of $294 million in the current quarter was $52 million higher compared to the second quarter of 2020.
This performance coupled with the efficiency gains from enterprisewide continuous improvement led to adjusted operating income for the quarter of $116 million, which was $77 million higher or three times the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $128 million, which increased by $76 million or over two times year-over-year.
Interest expense of $12 million in the second quarter was down 47% or $10 million compared to last year, driven by lower debt levels and effective interest rates.
On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter was $66 million or $0.87 a share.
Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $80 million, which yielded an adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $1.06, which was over five times our performance from Q2 of last year.
The year-over-year foreign currency impact in the quarter was unfavorable by $0.02.
In the second quarter, the average diluted shares outstanding were 14.7 million higher year-over-year as a result of our equity offering in the fourth quarter of prior year and the impact of restricted shares for compensation.
Global Solutions revenue of $1.98 billion was higher by $429 million or 28% year-over-year.
The segment experienced continued growth, driven by ongoing recovery in volumes associated with elective procedures of approximately $300 million along with higher sales of PPE as well as continued strong growth in our patient direct business.
Global Solutions operating income was $18.5 million, which was $29 million higher than prior year as a result of higher volumes coupled with productivity and efficiency gains in our medical distribution business.
In our Global Products segment, net revenue in the second quarter was $689 million, compared to $370 million last year, an increase of 86%, which was led by higher S&IP sales particularly PPE volume as we benefited from our previous investments to expand capacity and the previously discussed impact of passing through higher acquisition costs of approximately $200 million.
Operating income for the Global Products segment was $95 million, an increase of 84% versus $52 million in the second quarter last year.
Total net debt at the end of the second quarter was $964 million and total net leverage was 1.8 times trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA.
We now expect the full year top line impact of glove cost pass-through to be in the range of $675 million to $725 million.
Guidance for adjusted earnings per share is based on 75.5 million shares outstanding.
Even with the 6% increase in shares and new inflationary headwinds, we are confirming our outlook for 2021, 2022 and targets for 2026.
