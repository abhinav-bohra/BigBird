With just over $4 billion in sales, our first quarter revenue increased over 18% organically.
This compares to a market being up less than 13%.
So our outgrowth was about 570 basis points for the quarter, which was ahead of our expectation and our guidance for the year.
Our incremental margin performance was in line with our expectations, with an even strong free cash flow of $147 million for the quarter, a good strategy toward our full year guidance.
Flexible battery technology across multiple cell architectures, proven technology and products with established manufacturing facilities already in serial production today, strong order backlog of about $2.4 billion, primarily from leading OEMs and a focus on bus, CV and off-highway applications.
It operates at 400 volts and has exceptional peak power of 135 kilowatts.
With successful execution of this strategy, we expect to deliver over 25% of our revenue from electric vehicles by 2025 and approximately 45% by 2030.
As we look at our year-over-year revenue walk for Q1, we begin with pro forma 2020 revenue of $3.2 billion, which includes $945 million of revenue from Delphi Technologies.
Then our organic growth year-over-year was over 18% compared to a less than 13% increase in weighted average market production.
That translates to 570 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, which breaks down as follows: in Europe, we outperformed by mid- to high single digits, driven by growth in small gasoline turbochargers and strong performance in multiple former Delphi Technologies businesses, most notably fuel injection.
In North America, we outperformed the market by high single digits as we saw a nice benefit from the ramp-up of the new Ford F-150 and other new business launches.
The sum of all this was just over $4 billion of revenue in Q1, which was a new quarterly record for the company.
Our first quarter adjusted operating income was $444 million, compared to the pro forma $274 million in the first quarter of 2020.
This yielded an adjusted operating margin of 11.1%, which was up compared to the 10.3% margin for BorgWarner only in the first quarter of 2020.
On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income increased $145 million on $591 million of higher sales.
That translates to an incremental margin of roughly 25%.
We're proud of the fact that we generated $147 million of positive free cash flow during the first quarter, which was roughly flat year-over-year despite increased investment in working capital.
As you can see, we expect our global weighted light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets to increase in the range of nine percent to 12%, which is down from our previous assumption of an 11% to 14% increase.
Looking at this by region, we're planning for North America to be up 17% to 20%.
We see the largest incremental impact of the semiconductor shortage in North America with our market expectations down approximately 500 basis points from our initial assumptions.
In Europe, we expect a blended market increase of nine percent to 12%, with that range being down approximately 200 basis points from our earlier planning assumption.
Starting with our pro forma 2020 sales, which includes $2.6 billion of revenue from the first three quarters of Delphi Technologies in 2020.
You can see that our end market assumptions from the prior slide are expected to drive an increase in revenue of roughly $0.9 billion to $1.3 billion.
Next, we expect to drive market outgrowth for the full year of approximately 300 to 500 basis points, which is a meaningful step up from our previous guidance of 100 to 300 basis points.
Based on these assumptions, we expect our 2021 organic revenue to increase about 12% to 17% relative to 2020 pro forma revenue.
Then adding a $400 million benefit from stronger foreign currencies, we're projecting total 2021 revenue to be in the range of $14.8 billion to $15.4 billion.
That's up from our prior guidance by about $100 million at both ends of the revenue range.
From a margin perspective, we expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.5% compared to a pro forma 2020 adjusted operating margin of 8.3%.
This contemplates the business delivering full year incrementals in the low 20% range before the impact of Delphi related cost synergies and purchase price accounting.
From a cost synergy perspective, our margin guidance includes $70 million to $80 million of incremental benefit in 2021.
That puts us right on track to achieve 50% of our total expected cost synergies in 2021.
Based on this revenue and margin outlook, we're expecting full year adjusted earnings per share of $4 to $4.35 per diluted share, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $3.85 to $4.25 per diluted share.
I would point out that this guidance now assumes a 31% tax rate versus our prior guidance of 32% as a result of the successful execution of certain international tax planning initiatives.
And finally, we continue to expect that we'll deliver free cash flow in the $800 million to $900 million range for the full year.
AKASOL represents an important part of Project CHARGING FORWARD as it represents approximately 20% to 25% of the estimated 2025 revenue from acquisitions underlying our plan and it significantly increases our exposure to the ECV space.
As it relates to portfolio optimization, we continue to target combustion-related dispositions with annual revenue of approximately $1 billion to be executed over the next 12 to 18 months.
We delivered 570 basis points of market outgrowth, an 11.1% adjusted operating margin and $147 million of free cash flow.
