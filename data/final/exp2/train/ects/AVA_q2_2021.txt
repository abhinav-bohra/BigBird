We are confirming our 2021 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $1.96 to $2.16 per diluted share.

For 2023, we are confirming our earnings guidance with a consolidated range of $2.42 and to $2.62 per diluted share.
For 2021, we expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $1.83 to $1.97 per diluted share, and the lower end of our guidance in '21 and '22 for the Avista Utilities is primarily due to increased regulatory lag.
And our current expectation for the ERM is a surcharge position within the 90-10 sharing -- company sharing band, which is expected to decrease earnings by $0.08 per diluted share.

For 2021, as Dennis mentioned, we expect AEL&P to contribute $0.08 to $0.11.
And we increased the range in our other businesses by $0.10, which really offsets the utility reduction, and that's largely due to a range of $0.05 to $0.08 of diluted share because of investment gains and the gain we experienced from the sale of Spokane Steam Plant.
Avista Utilities contributed $0.11 per diluted share compared to $0.26 in 2020.

We currently expect Avista Utilities to have increased capital expenditures up to $450 million in 2021 and $415 million in 2022 -- or $445 million in '22 and '23.
That's a $35 million and $40 million increase in '21, '22 and '23, $40 million in '23 as well.
Our customer growth's about 1.5%, which is up from 0.5% to 1% in prior expectations.
