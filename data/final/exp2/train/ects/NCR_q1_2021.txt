First, we expanded the adjusted EBITDA margin to 16.7% in the first quarter, which represents an increase of 420-basis-points from the first quarter of 2020.

We have continued to progress executing our strategy and remain focused on our transition to drive NCR as-a-Service and achieve our 80/60/20 strategic goals.
We have made significant progress against these goals, particularly as we accelerate margin expansion toward our 20% adjusted EBITDA margin target.

The tax rate of 28.2% was higher than the 2020 Q1 tax rate of 13.5% and our full-year guidance of 26%, up in both cases due to higher income and a decrease in discrete tax benefits.
And finally, and maybe most importantly, we generated $98 million of free cash flow in the quarter.

We strive to generate 80% of our revenue from software and services or, described as the inverse, less than 20% of our revenue from discrete hardware sales.
In the first quarter, software and services represented 72% of our revenue, which is an increase from 71% in the fourth quarter.
The decline from 74% in the first quarter of 2020 was driven by higher SCO revenue this year.
We aim for 60% of our revenue to be recurring, to drive more resilient, more predictable, and more valuable revenue.
Recurring revenue represented 57% of total revenue, compared to 54% in the fourth quarter, and 53% in the first quarter of 2020.
And we aspire to a 20% adjusted EBITDA margin rate.
As I've already emphasized, we made significant progress in this metric with an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of 16.7%, compared to 12.5% in the first quarter of 2020, and 15.8% in the fourth quarter.
Free cash flow of $98 million in this quarter, compared to free cash outflow in last year's same quarter of $20 million.
Versus Q1 of 2020, all categories of inventory were down an aggregate of 17%, with days on hand down seven days operationally.

This slide also shows our net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA metric, with a leverage ratio of 3.2 times.
We ended the first quarter with $319 million of cash and remain well within our debt covenants.
We ended the first quarter with credit facility leverage of approximately 3.3 times, well under our debt covenant maximum of 4.6.
We amended and extended our senior secured credit facility which provided an incremental $1.3 billion of new Term Loan A, and issued new $1.2 billion in the 8-year senior notes.
The weighted average interest of these transactions is about 3.7%, which is significantly lower than our original model.
At the eventual close of the transaction, these funds will all become available, and our total leverage covenant will widen to 5.5 times to allow us to execute our plan to delever rapidly from a forecasted post-close level of 4.5 times.
So for Q2, for NCR is currently comprised, and relative to 2020's results, we expect revenue growth of 9% to 10%.
On profitability, we expect the adjusted EBITDA margin rate to expand by 250-basis-points to 300-basis-points to more than 16%.
We remain very excited about the transaction as the addition of Cardtronics will accelerate our NCR as-a-Service strategy and is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for the first year by 20% to 25%.
It will enhance our scale and cash flow generation while advancing our 80/60/20 strategic targets by roughly two years.
Looking forward, our key priorities are clear; First, we will continue to accelerate our NCR as-a-Service and 80/60/20 strategy.
