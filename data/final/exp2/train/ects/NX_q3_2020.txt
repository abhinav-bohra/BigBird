We reported revenue of $212.1 million during the third quarter of 2020, compared to $238.5 million during the third quarter of 2019.
We reported net income of $10.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the three months ended July 31, 2020, compared to $11.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share during the three months ended July 31, 2019.
On an adjusted basis, net income was $11.1 million or $0.34 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2020, compared to $13.7 million or $0.41 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2019.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter was $27.7 million, compared to $32.8 million during the same period of last year.
Cash provided by operating activities was $45.1 million for the three months ended July 31, 2020, which represents an increase of 50.8% compared to the three months ended July 31, 2019.
Cash provided by operating activities was $47.6 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2020, which represents an increase of 58.7% compared to the nine months ended July 31, 2019.
Free cash flow improved significantly during the third quarter to $40.7 million, which represents an increase of 57.1% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Year-to-date 2020, free cash flow more than doubled to $26.9 million compared to the same period of 2019.
Our balance sheet is healthy, our liquidity position is strong and getting stronger, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.1 times as of July 31, 2020, which is lower than where we exited fiscal 2019.
We will continue to focus on generating cash and paying down debt in the fourth quarter, which should allow us to exit fiscal 2020 with a leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA at or below one time.
Having said that, the recovery has been more robust than expected on all fronts, and we are now comfortable providing the following full-year 2020 guidance: net sales of $832 million to $837 million, adjusted EBITDA of $97 million to $102 million, capex of approximately $25 million and free cash flow of approximately $50 million.
Revenue in this segment was $122.4 million, down 10.2% from prior-year third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA of $17.8 million was $4.8 million less than prior-year third quarter.
We generated revenue of $38.3 million in our European fenestration segment, which was 13.7% less than prior year or down 12.9% after excluding the foreign exchange impact.
Despite low volume in May, this segment was able to realize adjusted EBITDA of $7.7 million in the quarter, which represents margin improvement of approximately 290 basis points over prior year.
Our North American cabinet components segment reported revenue of $51.9 million, which was 11.5% less than prior year.
However, revenue was only down 7.5% if you adjust for the customer that exited the cabinet manufacturing business in late 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $3.1 million, down $1.7 million from prior-year third quarter.
It is important to note, though, that EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $1.7 million accrual for writing off the final amount of customer-specific inventory associated with a customer that exited the cabinet business.
Absent this write-off, we would have realized margin expansion of approximately 90 basis points in this segment as well.
Finally, unallocated corporate and SG&A costs were $1.4 million better than prior-year third quarter.
