Since LCD televisions emerged as a mainstream technology in 2004, LCD TV units have only been down three times and never two years in a row.
Since 2014, TV sell-through units are typically range-bound between 225 million and 235 million, which average screen size grows about 1.5 inches a year.
In 2020, global television units increased 4% above the trend line to about $242 million.
Screen size growth was about 1.2 inches, about 20% below trend.
Entering this year, we expected and continue to expect the market to revert the trend, implying a decrease in TV units, especially smaller televisions, and for normal screen size growth of 1.5 inches to return.
Television units declined by about 10% year over year while average screen size growth is in line with the 1.5 inches per year trend.
Unit volume for TVs 65 inches and larger increased by a mid-teen percentage, and smaller TVs were down by a mid-teen percentage.
So three quarters through the year, our expectation for TV units being down year over year and screen size growing approximately 1.5 inches are playing out.
That means television units will be within the typical range of 225 million to 235 million units and average screen size will grow about 1.5 inches.
We would expect the average screen size to once again grow 1.5 inches next year.
