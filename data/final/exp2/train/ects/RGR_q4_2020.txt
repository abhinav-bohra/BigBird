As a reminder, our quarterly dividend is approximately 40% of net income and therefore varies quarter to quarter.

We remain committed to new product development as evidenced by our strong roster of our new products in 2020, which included the extremely popular Ruger-57 pistol, which is awarded the 2020 Caliber Award for best overall new product by the Professional Outdoor Media Association in conjunction with the NASGW.
22 Long Rifle, which is based on the venerable LCP platforms and utilizes our Lite Rack system for easier slide manipulation and reduced recoil.
And the PC Charger and AR-556 pistol, two pistol configurations based on established rifle platforms that have found widespread popularity.

This allowed us to realize a 30% increase in production during the latter half of the year.
As many of you are aware, in November, we purchased substantially all of the Marlin assets for $28.3 million.
These actions which cost approximately $3.6 million, in 2020, mitigated the adverse financial impact on our business, resulting from Covid19.
