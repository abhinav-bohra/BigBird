EPS grew 25% to a record $2.76.
These results were driven by strong growth in our U.S. residential HVAC equipment business, which grew 19% during the quarter and from operating efficiencies achieved throughout our network, as evidenced by the nominal change in SG&A.
Weekly users of our mobile apps have grown 31% since last year with over 100,000 downloads.
E-commerce transactions have grown by 19% this year to nearly 1 million online orders, which is about $1.5 billion in annual rate at the moment.
Our annual -- our annualized e-commerce sales run rate is 32%, versus 29% at the end of last year and in certain markets the use of e-commerce is over 50%.
This technology has only been available for a few months and already over 12,000 orders were fulfilled during the quarter by more than 2,000 unique users.
Contractors using our -- what we call OnCall Air platform provided digital proposals to over 39,000 households during the quarter, and generated $114 million in sales, nearly double that of last year.
Our CreditForComfort platform process doubled in number of digital financing applications resulting in an 87% increase in third-party funded loans.
Investments in inventory management software have also benefited us this year, with inventory turns improving 25 basis points over last year and of course contributing to cash flow and operating efficiency.
We generated record operating cash flow of $373 million, which is far away a record for the year, so far, and we have no debt at this time.
And I always like to comment that we're in a $40 billion industry of which we are only $5 billion, so we have lots of room for growth.
