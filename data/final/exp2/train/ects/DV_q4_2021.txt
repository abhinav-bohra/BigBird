First, as a quick snapshot of our recent growth, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered $106 million of revenue and 38% adjusted EBITDA margins, ending a year of exceptionally strong execution on a high note.
In 2021, we measured 4.5 trillion ad impressions, resulting in record revenue of $333 million, an increase of 36% compared with a year ago.

ABS revenue grew 77% in 2021 and contributed approximately $85 million to our top line.
While a significant majority of our top 100 clients are now using ABS in some applications, their usage of the product tends to be in North America where programmatic buying is dominant.
In the fourth quarter, for example, we activated ABS with Disney in Latin America, Colgate in EMEA, and Nike in 21 global markets.
Beyond our top 100 customers, approximately 40% of our top 500 clients still do not use ABS in any market, representing a solid expansion opportunity among this established customer base.
We expect this unique differentiator of DV's programmatic solutions, including ABS and DV custom contextual to further drive our programmatic sales momentum and support DV's overall RFP win rate, which was 80% in 2021.

On CTV, our impression volumes grew 57% in 2021.
And by the fourth quarter, 25% of our tag-based advertiser video impressions were CTV.
DV customers are fully protected from this scheme, which continues to scoop more than 5 million devices and over 80 million ad requests per day, undercutting ad investments and underlining performance.
To combat this latest viewability challenge, last month, DV launched fully on-screen prebid targeting, enabling connected advertisers to target inventory from sources that are tested and evaluated by DV to ensure ads are only displayed 100% on screen and when the TV screen is turned on.
