Notably, this follows a very strong first quarter of 2020, where net organic sales growth was 7%.
Over the last 12 months, we've exceeded our targets, delivering 3% net organic sales growth.
Importantly, we continue to have confidence in our 100 to 200 basis points goal for annual net organic sales growth established with Vision 2025.
As we look out specifically at the year to the anticipated volume from our innovation pipeline, coupled with return to growth in foodservice, we expect 2021 net organic sales growth will be at the high end of our 100 to 200 basis point range.
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter of $240 million met our expectations before the $29 million of costs we incurred associated with winter storm Uri.

Net sales increased 3% from the prior year to $1.65 billion, driven by 2% net organic sales growth and positions.
Adjusted EBITDA declined from the prior year quarter, primarily related to $29 million in costs associated with winter storm Uri and maintenance downtime.
As a result, adjusted earnings per share were $0.23 as compared to $0.31 in the first quarter of 2020.
Total liquidity remained significant at $1.44 billion.
Solid sales performance was driven by continued strength food, beverage and consumer markets, where sales before acquisitions increased 5%.
Partially offsetting this performance was our foodservice business, where sales declined 10% versus the prior year period.
On Slides 11 and 12, you'll see our year-over-year revenue and EBITDA waterfall.
Net sales increased $50 million in the first quarter of 2021, driven by $33 million of improved volume mix, resulting from a combination of 2% organic sales growth and acquisitions, partially offset by fewer selling days when compared to leap year observed in the prior year quarter as well as $20 million of favorable foreign exchange.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $55 million to $240 million in the first quarter of 2021.
Adjusted EBITDA benefited from $21 million in improved net productivity and $5 million from favorable foreign exchange.
EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by $3 million of pricing, $2 million of unfavorable volume mix, $34 million of commodity input cost inflation, $13 million of other inflation and $29 million of costs related to winter storm Uri.

While leverage is above our long-term targeted level of 2.5 times to three times and our 2021 target of three times to 3.5 times, we remain confident in our cash flow generation commitments and increase in expected cash flow generation in 2022.
We issued $800 million in two senior secured notes offerings.

As Mike mentioned, we expect 2021 net organic sales growth to be at the high end of our 100 to 200 basis points target range.
While some components of adjusted EBITDA have changed given the operating environment we are managing, our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.09 billion to $1.15 billion provided at the beginning of 2021 remains unchanged due to the numerous pricing, volume and productivity initiatives we are committed to successfully executing throughout the remainder of the year.
