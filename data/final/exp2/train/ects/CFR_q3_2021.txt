Overall, average loans in the third quarter were $16.2 billion compared with $18.1 billion in the third quarter of 2020, but this included the impact of PPP loans.
Excluding PPP loans, third quarter average loans of $14.8 billion were essentially flat from a year ago but up an annualized 6% on a linked quarter basis.
New loan commitments booked through the third quarter excluding PPP loans were up by 11% compared to the first nine months of last year.
For the quarter, new loan commitments were up by 6% on a linked quarter basis.

The increases are in both C&I, up 22%; and CRE, up 28%.

Excluding the impact of PPP loans, our net interest margin percentage would have been 2.27% in the third quarter, down from an adjusted 2.37% for the second quarter, with all of the decrease resulting from the higher level of balances at the Fed in the third quarter.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the third quarter was 4.16%, down 12 basis points from the previous quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been 3.74%, down six basis points from the prior quarter.

Regarding noninterest expense, looking at the full year 2021, we currently expect an annual expense growth rate of around 3% over our 2020 total reported noninterest expenses, which is consistent with our previous guidance.
Regarding the estimates for full year 2021 earnings, given our third quarter results and the recognition of lower PPP fee accretion for the fourth quarter, we currently believe that the current mean of analyst estimates of $6.48 is reasonable.
