First, we continue taking share in the global contact lens market, with CooperVision being flat for calendar Q3 against the market being down 3%.
Third, our myopia management portfolio comprised of MiSight and Ortho K lenses performed extremely well, including MiSight being up 73%.
Moving to the numbers and reporting all percentages on a constant-currency basis, we posted consolidated revenues of $682 million in Q4, with CooperVision revenues of $506 million, down 3%; and CooperSurgical revenues of $175 million, down 4%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.16.
For CooperVision, the Americas were up 3%, led by strength in MyDay and Biofinity and some rebound in channel inventory of roughly $10 million.
EMEA was down 6%, which included quarter-end purchasing delays from several large accounts as the region returned to more restrictive COVID-related lockdowns in October.
Asia Pac was down 8% with COVID-related softness lingering longer into the quarter than we were expecting.
Our silicone hydrogel dailies were up 1% in Q4, led by strength in torics and a strong rebound in MyDay sphere sales.
Given there still exists roughly $2.4 billion in traditional daily hydrogel sales worldwide, there's a significant multiyear trade-up opportunity for us and our industry.
We now have roughly 25,000 kids around the world wearing MiSight, including over 1,000 in the U.S., and the momentum when new fits is strong.
But we already have 2,100 optometrists certified to fit the lens and 1,400 more in the process of being certified.
launch, including the average age for a new MiSight wearer is 11 years old.
Getting fits in this age range is fantastic as the average age for fitting a new wearer in regular contact lenses is 17, which means we're getting an extra six years' worth of revenue.
Furthermore, 70% of kids being fit in MiSight are 12 and under.
Regarding sales, even with continuing COVID challenges, our myopia management portfolio, including MiSight and Ortho K lenses, grew 39% to $13 million.
Within these results, MiSight grew 73% to $2.5 million and Ortho K grew 33%, which included $1.3 million of revenue from last quarter's acquisition of GP Specialties.
For this coming year, even with COVID impacting the market, we're continuing to target $25 million in global MiSight sales, which is growth of roughly 250%.
But as we discussed last quarter, there's a clear path to a market that we expect will ultimately be well over $5 billion annually for manufacturers.
But new fits are running roughly 90% of pre-COVID levels on a global basis, and that's the challenge.
With roughly one-third of the world myopic, and this is expected to increase to 50% by 2050, combined with a continuing shift to daily silicone hydrogel lenses, geographic expansion, and strong growth in torics and multifocals, our industry has a very bright future.
Revenues rebounded faster than expected to $175 million for the quarter.
Although down 4%, we exceeded expectations in a challenging market environment and expect solid performance moving forward.
Revenues rebounded nicely and were only down 2% year over year.
The product almost doubled in revenue to $2.5 million and with a growing focus on safety and compliance within fertility clinics, we expect this product to continue growing nicely.
Within our office and surgical unit, we were down 5%, slightly better than forecasted.
PARAGARD continued to rebound, down 6% to $50 million against a tough comp from last year due to buy-in activity before price increase.
PARAGARD is another product that is benefiting from the positive wellness trends we're seeing in the U.S. as the only 100% hormone-free IUD on the U.S. market, it offers a fantastic long-lasting birth control option that addresses the needs and interests of women looking for a healthy alternative.
Our fourth-quarter consolidated revenues decreased 1% as reported or 3% in constant currency to $682 million.
Consolidated gross margin increased 70 basis points year over year to 67.7%.
OPEX was up 4.3% year over year, largely due to planned MiSight investment activity, including sales and marketing, regulatory, and R&D costs.
This resulted in consolidated operating margins of 26.8%, down from 28.5% last year.
Interest expense for the quarter was $6.7 million, driven by lower interest rates and lower average debt and the effective tax rate was 11.1%.

Net debt decreased by $76 million to $1.68 billion, and our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to 2.15 times.
This includes consolidated revenues of $642 million to $670 million, down 1% to up 4% or down 3% to up 2% in constant currency.
CooperVision revenue of $482 million to $502 million, down 1% to up 4% or down 3% to up 1% in constant currency.
And CooperSurgical revenue of $160 million to $168 million, down 1% to up 4%, both as reported and in constant currency.

As compared to last year, we expect the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to be up $0.07 due to a positive $0.21 currency impact, offset by MiSight investment activity and slightly lower gross margins tied to unfavorable manufacturing absorption.
