We've achieved a 130 basis point sequential increase in occupancy and a meaningful rebound in same-center NOI.
Same-center NOI in the second quarter was up 88% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and represents 93% of the same period in 2019.
Average tenant sales productivity grew to $424 per square foot for the trailing 12 months of 7.3% from $395 per square foot with the comparable 2019 period.
On a same-center basis, average tenant sales increased 5.5%.
Consolidated portfolio occupancy at quarter end was 93%, a 130 basis point increase from the end of the first quarter.
We have recaptured 80,000 square feet of space due to bankruptcies and retailer restructurings through the end of the second quarter and shortly after we captured an additional 55,000 square feet, which was expected and represents negotiated early terminations for our legacy outlet brands where we collected lease termination fees.
Leasing activity continues to accelerate with over 300 new leases and renewals totaling 1.6 million square feet of leasing that commenced during the last 12 months.
As of the ended the quarter, renewals executed or in process represented 54% of the space scheduled to expire during the year.
This revenue is captured in the other revenues line, which year-to-date is up 88% from last year and 26% over 2019.
Second quarter core FFO available to common shareholders was $0.43 per share compared to $0.10 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
Core FFO for the second quarter of 2021 includes $0.02 per share dilution from the shares issued to date and excludes a charge of $14 million or $0.13 per share for the early extinguishment of debt since we redeemed $150 million of our 2023 bonds.
Same-center NOI for the consolidated portfolio increased 87.6% for the quarter as the prior year reflects reductions in rental revenues due to the pandemic along with higher variable rents driven by better than expected tenant sales performance this year.
We have collected approximately 98% of contractual fixed rents build in the first half of 2021.
Through July 30, 2021, we had collected 98% of the 2020 deferred rents due to be repaid in the first half of 2021.
We issued 3.1 million common shares that generated $58 million in net proceeds at a weighted average price of $18.85 per share.
Year-to-date, we sold 10 million shares and raised $187 million of equity at an average price of $18.97 per share.
As previously announced, on April 30, we completed the partial early redemption of $150 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.87% senior notes due December 2023 for $163 million in cash.
Subsequent to the redemption, $100 million remains outstanding.
We also paid down our unsecured term loan by an additional $25 million in June, bringing the outstanding balance to $300 million.
Additionally, in July, we amended and extended our unsecured lines of credit, pushing the maturity date to July 2026 including extension options and providing borrowing capacity of $520 million within an accordion feature to increase capacity to $1.2 billion.
For the full year 2021, we expect core FFO to be in the range of $1.52 and $1.59 per share, up from our prior expectations of $1.47 to $1.57.
This guidance reflects continued sequential improvement in our business, offset by the additional dilution of approximately $0.02 per share related to the common shares sold in the second quarter, which is an addition to the $0.4 of dilution from the first quarter issuances included in our prior guidance.
Our guidance includes the 135,000 square feet of space we have recaptured-to-date through the end of July, along with potential for an additional 65,000 square feet related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructuring for the remainder of the year.
