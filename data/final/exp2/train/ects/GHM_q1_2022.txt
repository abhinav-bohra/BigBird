Revenue in the quarter was $20.2 million, $16.7 million was organic and $3.5 million was due to the acquisition of Barber-Nichols that closed June 1.
Defense revenue was 35% of total revenue in the quarter.
We do expect that defense revenue will approach 50% of total quarterly revenue with Barber-Nichols fully in future quarters.
You might recall that our first quarter last year operated at nominally 50% capacity due to COVID-19, thus impacting revenue and profitability due to under-absorption.
Orders from our crude oil refining and chemical/petrochemical markets were very low during the third and fourth quarters last fiscal year where non-Navy orders totaled $17.5 million for both quarters.
Orders in the first quarter were $20.9 million and were principally organic.
Barber-Nichols orders were $200,000 for the month of June.
Somewhat encouragingly, there were strong orders from our crude oil refining market in the quarter that totaled $11.5 million.
And now, 25 years later, we won back the installation and replaced the original supplier with our own vacuum systems.
Consolidated backlog at June 30 was $236 million, of which 80% is for defense.
As announced earlier today and as Debbie had mentioned, I'm very pleased to confirm that I will retire effective August 31 at the end of this month and Dan Thoren will succeed me as President and CEO of the corporation.
It has been a tremendous honor and great privilege for me to serve Graham shareholders and the corporation as its Principal Executive Officer since 2006.
Sales in the quarter improved by $3.5 million, which was due to the one month that we owned Barber-Nichols.
However, in that quarter, we did have a $5 million project which was recognized on a completed contract basis and because of COVID had shifted from fiscal 2020 into Q1 of 2021.
We also had a small amount of acquisition expenses, about $169,000 pre-tax, and the first month of purchase price accounting related costs for Barber-Nichols.
To clarify the latter, the purchase accounting amortization costs were $225,000 before taxes in June.
Before we move on, I want to mention that we expect approximately $2.7 million pre-tax and $2.15 million after-tax related to acquisition purchase accounting.
90% of this is amortization costs, with the rest being a step-up in depreciation and inventory.
We expect the amount of amortization will be similar in fiscal 2023 as fiscal 2022 since we will have 12 rather than 10 months of amortization in fiscal 2023.
It will decrease in future years and level off at approximately $1.1 million pre-tax.
We have added $20 million of low-cost term debt as part of the acquisition and we have access to a much larger revolving line of credit.
We expect the acquisition of Barber-Nichols to be accretive in fiscal 2022, even with the $2.15 million or approximately $0.20 a share in added amortization costs.
With a $236 million backlog, we are well positioned for long-term growth.
80% of that backlog is in the defense market, which provides an excellent baseline for our business, not just this year, but in upcoming years as well.
Before I pass it over to Dan, I would be remiss if I didn't recognize Jim for his 37 years of service at Graham, the last 15 years being as leader.
Graham manufacturing second quarter orders are $9.5 million to date, while Barber-Nichols has booked $9.1 million.
Based on the timing of customers' projects, we are holding our revenue guidance at $130 million to $140 million of which Barber-Nichols is expected to contribute between $45 million and $48 million.
Combined, the Defense segment is expected to account for almost half of the revenue and EBITDA is expected to be in the $7 million to $9 million range.
Capital expenditures are planned to be in the $3.5 million to $4 million range, including the Barber-Nichols capital expenditure.
