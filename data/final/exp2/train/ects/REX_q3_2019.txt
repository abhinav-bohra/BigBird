Sales for the quarter declined 30% primarily due to reduced ethanol gallons sold offset by an $0.11 increase in per-gallon ethanol pricing.
Sales for the quarter were based upon 47.6 million gallons this year versus 71.4 million last year.
Our consolidated corn cost per bushel rose 25% compared to the prior year, again, largely reflecting the concern for corn availability.
Combining these factors led to gross profit for the ethanol and by-product segment decreasing from $11.3 million in the prior year to $25,000 for the current year.
The refined coal segment had a gross loss of $1.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 versus $3.5 million for the prior year, reflecting lower production levels in the current year.
These losses are offset by tax benefits recorded under Section 45 credits.
SG&A decreased for the third quarter from $5.4 million to $4.1 million, primarily due to reduced incentive compensation associated with corporate profitability and reduced commission fees associated with the lower refined coal production.
Equity and income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates decreased from $611,000 [Phonetic] to a small loss of $15,000 for the quarter.
Interest and other income increased from $809,000 to $1 million, primarily reflecting higher interest rates in the current year.
We booked a tax benefit of $3.2 million for the third quarter of this year versus a benefit of $10 million in the prior year.
The benefit is primarily as a result of the Section 45 credits from our refined coal operation, and again reflects lower refined coal production in the current year.
The above factors led to a net loss attributable to REX shareholders for the third quarter of $2.1 million this year compared to income of $11.9 million, and a loss per share of $0.32 this year versus income of $1.86 in the prior year.
Our cash balance was approximately $196 million.
We have -- still, have our authorized share repurchase program, 350,000 shares are still open to be bought.
Recently the EPA approved 31 small refineries exemptions for 2018, effectively reducing by 1.4 billion gallons obligation required under the renewable fuel standard.
The EPA has granted a waiver of 2016 and 2017 totally, 2.6 billion gallons.
The EPA has already received 10 petitions for small refinery exemption for -- from the 2019 renewable fuel standard compliance year.
As far as concerned about ethanol export, during the first nine-month of 2019, export fell to 1.1 billion gallons compared to 1.25 billion gallons during the same period last year.
Last year, ethanol export were very healthy 1.7 billion gallon.
We expect ethanol export will drop to 1.5 billion gallon this year due to the continued trade uncertainty.
The ethanol stock last week drew 237,000 barrels and the stock ended 22.277 million barrels.
That's almost -- that's now of almost 1.6 million barrels over just the last three weeks, according to a EIA data release on November 27, for the week ending in November 22nd.
Ethanol stock is down 11.6% compared to the same week, last year.
As far as concern about the distiller grain, in the first nine months of 2019, export felt to approximately 8.3 million metric tons compared to 8.9 million metric tons in the first nine months of 2018, according to the USDA.
That's a reduction of 6% U.S. export of distiller grain in the September dropped approximately 72,000 metric tons to 1,046,000 metric tons, about 6.4% reduction in August.
However, that was 2% above the 1,020,000 metric tons exported in September 2018.
The country bought approximately 137,000 metric tons, down about 23% from the 180,000 metric tons it bought in August.
DDG is currently trading at approximately 100 -- 210% [Phonetic] of the corn value.
Farmers planted 19 million acres of corn and estimated corn yield is about 167 bushels per acre.
Corn use for ethanol field were down 25 million bushels each and export and domestic consumption was down about 50 million bushels each.
Because of the delayed planting season, it is estimated approximately 1 billion or more bushels of corn are left to be harvested.
The carryout for 2019 and 2020 is expected to be 1.91 [Phonetic] billion bushels according to USDA.
We have not seen this kind of situation during the last 10 years, including the drought year of 2012.
As far as concern about the capital expenses, during the last nine months, we made total capital expenses up approximately $2.6 million at our consolidated ethanol plant.
We estimate $5 million to $6 million of capital expenses during the fourth quarter, excluding any maintenance expenses.
