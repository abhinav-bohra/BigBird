Combined, these brands represent about 20% of our revenues.
When combined with our existing eye care business, we now have a $100 million-plus franchise that addresses a range of consumer ailments across the $1 billion category.

North America revenues were up about 15%.
International OTC increased approximately 30% in Q1 after excluding the effects of foreign currency.
EBITDA increased in Q1, approximately 13% while EBITDA margin remained consistent with our long-term expectations in the mid-30s.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was a record $1.14 per share, up over 30% versus the prior year driven by both the higher sales discussed and lower interest expense.
Q1 fiscal '22 revenues increased 17% versus the prior year.

Advertising and marketing came in at 14.7% for the first fiscal quarter.
Following the abnormally low rate of spend in Q1 of last year due to COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions, A&M returned to normalized levels of spend of approximately 14% to 16%.

And for Q2, we anticipate A&M of closer to 14%.
G&A expenses were just over 8% of sales in Q1.
For the full year fiscal '22, we still anticipate G&A expenses to approximate just over 9% of sales.
Lastly, record diluted earnings per share of $1.14 grew 32.5% over the prior year.

For the second quarter, we anticipate revenues of $260 million or more.
This revenue outlook assumes a few key factors: one, that the travel-impacted portion of our business will continue at the recovered levels for the remainder of the year; two, we still anticipate flat sales to prior year in the cough and cold and head lice areas of our business; and three, the acquisition of the Akorn portfolio discussed today should contribute approximately $40 million to the fiscal year net sales.
We anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $3.90 or more for fiscal '22.
For Q2, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.95 or more.
