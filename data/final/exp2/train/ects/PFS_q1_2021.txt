Earnings per share were $0.63 for the quarter as compared to $0.23 for the same period in 2020.
Annualized return on average assets was 1.51%, and annualized return on average tangible equity was 16.8%.
And our core deposits are now 91% of total deposits.
Operating expenses were $61.9 million increase from the prior year, largely due to the addition of compensation and occupancy expenses from SB One.
Non-interest expense to average assets was 1.95% versus 2.13% for 2020.
Our efficiency ratio was 56.19%.
Deferrals are down to $132 million, of which $123.5 million are commercial loans.
And of that number, approximately 96% are paying interest.
In addition to further expanding our successful wealth management and insurance groups we, will evaluate other sources of revenue with a long-term goal of having non-spread income comprised in excess of 25% of our net income.
This quarter we originated or funded $526 million of new loans excluding line of credit advances and net PPP loan activity.
At quarter end, our pipeline remains strong at approximately $1.3 billion, and we are seeing a marginal improvement in the average rate in the pipeline.

Core pre-tax pre-provision earnings, excluding provisions for credit losses on loans and commitments to extend credit were $48.9 million for a pre-tax pre-provision ROA of 1.52%.
This is consistent with $50.1 million or 1.54% in the trailing quarter which also included -- excluded merger related charges and COVID response costs.
Our net interest margin expanded six basis points versus the trailing quarter to 3.10% as benefits from PPP loan forgiveness reduced funding costs and a steeper yield curve were partially offset by lower yielding excess liquidity.
We expect to maintain a core margin of approximately 3% as we continue to deploy excess liquidity into loans and securities, while we're pricing funding downward and continuing to emphasize non-interest bearing deposit growth.
Including non-interest bearing deposits, our total cost of deposits fell to 30 basis points this quarter from 31 basis points in the trailing quarter.
Average non-interest bearing deposits were stable at $2.4 billion or 24% of total average deposits for the quarter.

Of the $123 million of commercial loans in deferral, 96% are paying interest.
Non-interest income increased $1.2 million versus the trailing quarter to $22 million as growth in insurance agency income, loan and deposit fees, wealth management income, and bank-owned life insurance income was partially offset by reductions in net profits on loan level swaps and gains on loan sales.
