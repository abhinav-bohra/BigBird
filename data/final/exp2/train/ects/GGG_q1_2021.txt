Sales were $454 million in the quarter, an increase of 22% from the first quarter of last year and an increase of 18% at consistent translation rates.
The effect of currency translation added 4 percentage points of growth or approximately $11 million in the first quarter.
Reported net earnings totaled $105.7 million for the quarter or $0.61 per diluted share.
After adjusting for the impact of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises, net earnings totaled $101.6 million or $0.58 per diluted share.
Gross margin rates were strong in the quarter, up 120 basis points from the first quarter of last year as the favorable effects from currency translation, realized pricing and factory volumes were partially offset by the unfavorable impact on material costs and mix related to the significant growth in the lower margin contractor segment.
Operating expenses increased $10 million in the quarter, including $2 million related to currency translation, $5 million of increases in sales and earnings based expenses and $2.5 million in new product development as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives.
Other non-operating expenses decreased $5 million due to an improvement in the market valuation of investments held to fund certain retirement benefit liabilities.
The effective tax rate was 16% for the quarter, which is 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter of last year, due to a decrease in excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises.
Cash flows from operations totaled $102 million, compared to $54 million in the first quarter of last year.
Capital expenditures were $21 million and dividends paid were $31.6 million.
Based on current exchange rates, the effect of currency translation will continue to be a tailwind for us with the full year effect estimated to be 2% on sales and 5% on earnings with the most significant impact occurring in the first half of the year.
We expect unallocated corporate expense to be approximately $30 million and can vary by quarter.
Our 2021 full year tax rate is expected to be approximately 18% to 19%, excluding any effect from excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises.
Capital expenditures are estimated to be $140 million, including $90 million for facility expansion projects.
Finally, 2021 will be a 53 week year with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter.
