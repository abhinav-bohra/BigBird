Adjusted revenue for the quarter was $253 million, well above the guidance we provided as we saw outperformance in asset-based and subscription-based revenue as well as professional services.
Operating expenses overall came in around $5 million lower than our expectations for the quarter.
As a result, our adjusted EBITDA of $67.6 million was up 24% compared to last year.
This translated to similarly strong performance in adjusted earnings per share of $0.72, 20% above last year.
We now expect adjusted revenue for the year to be between approximately $991 million and $993 million, up 9% year-over-year.
Adjusted EBITDA to be between $238 million and $239 million, up 23% to 24%, and we are raising adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.51 and $2.53.
To add some context to the full year, our EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share this year are meaningfully higher than we expected at the beginning of the year, with revenue growth expected at 9% and EBITDA growth expected at 23% to 24%.
We ended September with $363 million in cash and debt of $863 million, including the convertible notes we issued in August.
Our net leverage ratio at the end of September was 2.1 times EBITDA, down from the 2.3 times at the end of June.
With $500 million available on the revolver, meaningful cash on the balance sheet and positive cash flow generation, we are comfortable that we have the liquidity and flexibility as we balance managing the business in the current environment with continuing to invest in growth opportunities, both organically and through strategic activities.
