Over the past 15 years, LIFO has netted to only $9 million of expense to the Company.
While this average is less than $1 million annually, year-to-year changes have been significant at times.
As a result of this accounting change, we expect to make tax payments of approximately $21 million based on current tax rate.
The cash outlay will occur over the three-year period of 2021 through 2023, with approximately $11 million of that to be paid in 2021.
Consistent with that pattern, cash from operations was a negative $11 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $21 million versus $10 million in the same quarter of 2020.
We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 12%.

2021 sales are now expected to be $4.8 billion to $5 billion, or up 12% to 17% over 2020 resulting from mid-to-single -- mid-to-high single-digit volume growth, raw material related price increases, and currency benefit.
The increase versus prior guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion reflect the combination of higher raw material related price increases and modestly higher volume growth.
2021 earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.75, primarily reflecting higher volume and higher metal margin.
This guidance also assumes fixed cost savings as a result of actions taken in 2020 to be approximately $70 million.
Based upon this guidance framework, our 2021 full year EBIT margin should be in the range of 11% to 11.5%.
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 23%, depreciation and amortization to approximate $195 million, net interest expense of approximately $75 million and fully diluted shares of 137 million.
Additionally, we expect our full year operating cash flow to approximate $500 million, capital expenditures to approximate $150 million, dividends of approximately $220 million and debt repayment of at least $51 million.
