Our 2021 through 2024 annual utility earnings per share growth rates of 8% are top decile among our peers, and we also expect to achieve at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% utility earnings per share guidance range each year from 2025 to 2030.
Last year, we had a $13 billion 5-year capital plan.
We increased that to $16 billion in our 2020 Analyst Day.
In this year, we increased it yet again to $18 billion plus.
And with our newest announcement around our industry-leading ESG targets, we are on the path to executing our goals to be net 0 on direct emissions by 2035.
The storm headwinds of up to 90 miles an hour, leaving 470,000 of our Houston Electric customers without power.
Within three days, we had 95% of the power restored for those customers.
For the third time this year, we are increasing our 2021 utility earnings per share guidance this time to $1.26 to $1.28 for the full year.
And for the first nine months, we've already achieved nearly 80% of that full year goal.
More importantly, we are still targeting an 8% annual growth rate for 2022 to 2024.
So this raises our guidance for 2022 utility earnings per share to $1.36 to $1.38.
For the third quarter of 2021, we reported $0.25 of utility EPS, which compares to $0.29 in the third quarter of 2020.
In the third quarter of this year, we had a onetime impact to earnings of $0.04 per share related to our most recent Board implemented governance changes.
As I mentioned earlier, we have increased our five-year capital plans to $18 billion plus over the next five years and $40 billion plus over the next 10 years.
This is nearly a 40% increase in our five-year capital investment plan since the third quarter of 2020.
We already have an outstanding RFP for additional mobile generation, which could bring our total up to 500 megawatts and hope to have this procured in the coming months.
We believe that this will help to support continuity and crews on a long-term basis and reduce the impact of any labor disruptions in executing our $40 billion-plus capital spend over the next 10 years.
We remain committed to our continuous improvement cost management efforts and our target of 1% to 2% average annual reductions.
We stated in the second quarter that we could accelerate approximately $20 million of recurring O&M work forward from 2022 into this year if we had the available resources.
So far, we've achieved approximately 20% of this goal year-to-date and remain confident around our team's ability to continue to execute toward this goal for the balance of the year.
On a year-over-year basis, we saw about 2% customer growth for electric and 1% for natural gas through September.
As part of our long-term electric generation transition plan, we received the CPCN approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the first tranche of solar generation, 75% of which we expect to own and 25% due a PPA.
As outlined in our IRP, we are targeting to own approximately 50% of our total solar generation portfolio.
Our continued build-out of renewables is a key driver in achieving our net zero direct emissions goal by 2035.
We are happy to report that just this past week, we reached a settlement on the prudence proceedings supporting securitization of 100% of gas costs in Texas, including all of related carrying costs.
The full rate case requests $67.1 million per year, while the rate stabilization plan requests $39.7 million per year and an extended recovery period for winter storm costs.
Largely as a result of mechanisms in our Houston Electric in Indiana South gas jurisdictions, we have recently received approval for $40 million of increased incremental annual revenue.
As discussed in our Analyst Day, we anticipate approximately 80% of our 10-year capital plans to be recovered through interim mechanisms, which demonstrates the constructive jurisdictions in which we operate.
On a GAAP earnings per share basis, we reported $0.32 for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 for the third quarter of 2020.
Looking at slide five, we reported $0.33 of non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of 2021 compared to $0.34 for the third quarter of 2020.
Our utility earnings per share was $0.25 for the third quarter of 2021, while midstream investments contributed another $0.08.
Favorable growth in rate recovery, lower interest expense and reversal of the net impacts from COVID last year, each contributed $0.01 of favorability.
Board implemented governance changes recorded this quarter and another $0.03 of unfavorable variance attributable to weather and usage.
For context, we experienced 73 fewer cooling degree day in Houston for the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020.
We estimate that each cooling degree day above normal has approximately a $70,000 a day impact in our Houston Electric business.
For the first nine months, we've achieved nearly 80% of our full year 2021 utility earnings per share guidance, which we are now raising to $1.26 to $1.28.
And as Dave said, we are also raising our utility earnings per share guidance for 2022 to $1.36 to $1.38, which is an 8% increase from our new 2021 estimates.
Looking beyond that, we are focused on delivering 8% annual utility earnings per share growth through 2024 and at the mid- to high end of our 6% to 8% annual utility earnings per share range over the remainder of our 10-year plan, strong growth each year and every year, no CAGRs for earnings.
Our preferred Series B shares converted into 36 million common shares as of September 1, further reducing the number of share classes outstanding.
We've spent approximately $2.3 billion year-to-date on capital investments.
We outlined on our Analyst Day the three buckets that we are investing in, safety, reliability and growth and enabling clean investments that are included in our $40 billion plus 10-year capital investment plan.
We see those opportunities weighted nearly 60% toward investments in our electric business throughout the plan.
Our current liquidity remains strong at $1.8 billion, including available borrowings under our short-term credit facilities and unrestricted cash.
Our long-term FFO to debt objective remains between 14% and 15%, aligning with Moody's methodology and is consistent with the expectations of the rating agencies.
