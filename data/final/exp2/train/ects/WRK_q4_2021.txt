We generated $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow in fiscal 2021, the sixth straight year that WestRock has generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow.
During fiscal 2021, we invested $816 million into our business through capital investments that maintained our assets and support our growth in the future.
Given our consistent cash flow generation over multiple business cycles, we increased our dividend, raising it 20% in May, and then again, as announced in October, for a total increase of 25% since February.

This commodity cost inflation combined with our seasonal increase in healthcare cost is forecasted to be approximately $100 million higher than the fourth quarter.
And due to delays in mill maintenance earlier in fiscal 2021, along with our originally planned outages, we have approximately 200,000 tons of scheduled downtime across our system that will negatively impact earnings by approximately $75 million.
We have 10 major mill maintenance outages in the first fiscal quarter, one of the largest amounts in one quarter in WestRock's history.
These assumptions, combined with three fewer shipping days and the normal seasonality in our consumer business, results in forecasted adjusted segment EBITDA of $660 million to $700 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.67 per share.
Our planned mill maintenance outage schedule declines throughout the fiscal year, but will still be approximately 100,000 tons higher than in fiscal 2021.
Given these assumptions, we forecast adjusted segment EBITDA to be in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion.
