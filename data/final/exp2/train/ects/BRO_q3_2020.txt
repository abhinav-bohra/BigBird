On a year-to-date basis, the net impact of the change in estimated earn-out payables that they charge of about $5 million as compared to a credit of approximately $7 million for the same period last year.
Excluding the change in acquisition earn-out payables in the third quarter of both years, our income before income taxes, grew $27.2 million or 18.6% growing faster than EBITDAC due primarily to lower interest expense.

Our EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 250 basis points and EBITDAC grew 16.2% due to higher organic revenue growth and cost savings achieved in response to the pandemic, both of which were partially offset by a prior year gain on disposals, higher non-cash stock compensation cost and higher inter-company IT cost.
Our income before income tax margin increased 50 basis points and grew slower than EBITDAC, due primarily to a change in estimated acquisition earn-outs.
Over to slide number 10.
Our National Programs segment increased total revenues by $25.1 million or 17.6% and organic revenue by 8.4%.
EBITDAC growth of 12.7% was slower than total revenue growth due to the write-offs of certain receivables in one of our programs.
Income before income taxes increased by $600,000 or 1.3% with the growth primarily impacted by increased acquisition earn-out payables and higher intercompany interest expense.
Over to slide number 11.
Our Wholesale Brokerage segment delivered total revenue growth of 16.2% and organic revenue growth of 8.2%.
EBITDAC grew by 21.1% and the margin improved by 160 basis points as compared to the prior year due to strong organic growth and the delivery of reduced variable expenses in response to COVID-19, which more than offset higher inter-company IT charges and higher non-cash stock-based compensation cost.
Our income before income taxes, grew by 21.1%, substantially in line with EBITDAC growth.
Over to slide number 12.
Total revenues and organic revenues for our services segment declined by 13.1%, driven by the items Powell mentioned earlier.
For the quarter, EBITDAC declined by 22.8%, driven by lower organic revenue and higher inter-company IT expenses.
Income before income taxes decreased 59.5% due to a credit of $6.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2019 for the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables and there was no adjustment in the third quarter of this year.
Regarding cash flow from operations, as a percentage of revenues, it decreased as expected for the third quarter due primarily to about $50 million of second quarter taxes that were paid in the third quarter as permitted by the Cares Act.
Our cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue was approximately 27% as compared to 25% realized at the same period of the prior year.
Regarding liquidity and interest expense, Powell mentioned earlier that we issued $700 million of 10.5 year senior notes in late September with spread decreasing materially and the receptivity of the debt markets we thought it was prudent to access the additional capital at long-term rate materially below our prior issuances.
Our incremental debt is $500 million as we repaid $200 million on the revolving line of credit.
With the additional debt, our interest expense will increase by approximately $3 million per quarter.
Through 10 months, we've seen 6.4 million acres burn in California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado with 4.3 million of those acres in California alone.
There have been 27 tropical storms and 10 hurricanes with five of these hurricanes hitting the Gulf Coast region and one may hit this week.

Quite honestly, I didn't think our cost of borrowing for 10-year money would ever be 2.375%.
