In light of the divestiture of our Polymer Components business, we are adjusting our sales guidance to be in the range of $1.085 to $1.12 billion and our 2021 adjusted EBITDA range to $202 million to $208 million.
We expected adjusted -- or we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, and up slightly at the midpoint from the range of $5.16 to $5.50 provided last quarter.
Our guidance assumes depreciation and amortization expense, excluding amortization of acquisition, acquisition-related intangible assets in the range of $28 million to $30 million and net interest expense of $13 million to $15 million.
The company is expected to generate sales and EBITDA in 2021 of approximately $190 million and $70 million, respectively.
Finally, we look for EBITDA margins and cash flow return on investment greater than 20%.
The combination of NxEdge with the existing AST businesses would result in aftermarket recurring revenue increasing from 35% to 44% of 2020 pro forma ASD sales.
Looking at Slides 20 and 21.
TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have all announced major expansions in the U.S.-focused on leading-edge chip nodes sub-14 nanometer.
Under the terms of the agreement announced today, EnPro will acquire NxEdge from Tribe Capital for $850 million in cash, subject to limited closing adjustments, including working capital.
As Eric mentioned, NxEdge expects to generate sales and adjusted EBITDA in 2021 of approximately $190 million and $70 million, respectively.
At current interest rates, we expect NxEdge to contribute approximately $1.70 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2022, which represents approximately 30% above the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range.
Of note, 2021 pro forma adjusted EBITDA margins are 700 basis points above 2019 margins.
And with 240 basis points of that improvement attributable to the impact of this year's completed and announced transactions.
Upon completion of the NxEdge acquisition, we anticipate net leverage of approximately 3.7 times adjusted EBITDA.
Proceeds from the sale of CPI will lower our leverage ratio to about 3.3 times.
This is the right deal at the right time, with the right company, with the right leadership for EnPro in a growing market that expects to exceed $1 trillion by 2030.
