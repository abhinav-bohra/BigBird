We followed that news in July with an agreement to purchase Infinity World's 50% interest in CityCenter and then to subsequently sell and lease back the underlying real estate to Blackstone at an unprecedented cap rate for gaming asset.
Combining these transactions grant us greater financial flexibility by the means of $11.6 billion in domestic liquidity and importantly, they allow us to intensify our focus on maximizing growth in our core business and pursuing opportunities that align to our long-term vision.
2 operator in the space nationwide, and in the second quarter, it commended 24% share of its live markets.
BetMGM remains a clear leader in iGaming, having reached a 30% market share in the second quarter, and we also continue to see the benefits of customer acquisition cross pollinization between MGM and BetMGM.
In the second quarter, 15% of BetMGM's new players came from MGM and 31% of MGM M life sign-ups came from BetMGM.
Further, 11 of our 17 domestic properties had all-time record quarters and slot gross win.
Consider the entertainment programming a few weekends ago, we had Garth Brooks at Allegiant Stadium, we had a McGregor fight at T-Mobile and Bruno Mars at Park MGM, selling over 98,000 tickets within our properties distance situated to capture significant amount of this foot traffic.
Our consolidated second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion, significantly better sequentially over our first-quarter results.
Our net income attributable to MGM Resorts was $105 million, and our second-quarter adjusted EBITDAR improved sequentially to $607 million -- $617 million, once again, heavily driven by our domestic operations.
Our Las Vegas strip net revenues in the second quarter were $1 billion, 31% below the second quarter of 2019 and 28% below, excluding Circus Circus Las Vegas, which was sold at the end of 2019.
Our second-quarter adjusted property EBITDAR was $397 million, which is 5% below the second quarter of 2019 and just 1% lower, excluding Circus.
Hold had a $6 million negative impact to our EBITDAR this quarter, so Hold-adjusted strip EBITDAR in Las Vegas was $403 million.
Our strip margins improved almost 1,100 basis points to an all-time record of 39.5%.
And this does not include the results of CityCenter, which generated $120 million of EBITDAR at a 46% margin.
And our second-quarter casino room mix was 9 points above pre-COVID levels.
Furthermore, our second-quarter casino revenues were 15% above 2019 levels and contributed to 35% of our overall net revenues in the second quarter.
This compares to roughly 22% in all of 2019.
Our second-quarter slot handle was 23% greater than that of the second quarter of 2019 on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Circus Circus.
Our second-quarter occupancy was 77%, an improvement from 46% in the first quarter with weekends and weekdays at 94% and 70%, respectively.
June occupancy was 83%, with weekends and weekdays at 96% and 79%, respectively.
July occupancy was 86%.
Longer term, we believe that the 40% margins we achieved this past quarter will stabilize a bit lower as casino spend and overall business mix normalizes, and also as we ramp up staffing to more sustainable levels in order to serve our guests more fully.
Our second-quarter regional net revenues of $856 million were aided by the continuing easing of statewide restrictions, and we're just 6% below that of the second quarter in 2019.
We delivered adjusted property EBITDAR well over 2019 levels, 22% to be exact, to $318 million.
Much like in Las Vegas, we're driving success in casino, with second-quarter casino revenues outpacing 2019 levels by 8%, primarily due to slots and our higher-end customer base.
Our 50 to 64 age demographic, of which I'm a proud member, is now at 2019 levels, and we're attracting more of the 65-plus age demographic.
Our second-quarter regional margin of 37% was also an all-time record, growing 855 basis points over the second quarter of 2019 and sequentially by 316 basis points over the first quarter.
And the breadth of our efforts gives me confidence that we will deliver on the $450 million of cost savings domestically, which we previously identified.

Finally, in Macau, marketwide GGR sequentially improved 7% in the second quarter, but still remained depressed at only 35% of second-quarter 2019 levels.
Nevertheless, as Bill mentioned earlier, MGM China outperformed the market, with its GGR having recovered to 43% of pre-pandemic levels.

We sold MGM Springfield's underlying real estate to MGP for $400 million at a 13.3 times rent multiple or a 7.5% cap rate.

As part of the agreement, we'll hold an approximately 1% stake in the newly combined company valued at nearly $400 million.
We will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI, with initial year's rent at $860 million.
The transaction values MGP at an implied 17.5 times pro rata EBITDA multiple for a 5.8% cap rate.
