From a balance sheet perspective, our combination of operating performance and sale of noncore assets allowed us to add over $0.5 billion to the balance sheet by the end of our third quarter.
Our shareholders benefited significantly as well as our share price rose by over 100% for the year, greatly outstripping our public company and industry competitors.
Since inception, we've averaged over 100 applicants for every internship position we've created, and these numbers continue to rise each year.
Our efforts bore fruit in the fourth quarter with the release of the -- of three new powder bed printing systems, including our SLS 380 polymer-based system as well as our DMP Flex 200, and DMP 350 Dual metal-based printers, the latter of which is a dual-laser version of our top-selling single-laser system.
By the end of 2021, with these acquisitions having closed, we exited with roughly $800 million in cash on our balance sheet for the future.
This scale has a tremendous advantage, not only increasing our operating efficiencies, but also in providing critical ongoing customer application support as well as 24/7 service to our customers, no matter where they're located, over the life of their investments.
We're proud to say that our installed base currently prints over 700,000 parts per day, which is more than the rest of the industry combined.
With an open system architecture, a Titan printer has available to it hundreds of standard polymer formulations, allowing customers to not only select the ideal material for their application, but also realize potential cost savings of up to 75% versus traditional filament extrusion.
So in summary, with our tremendous progress over the last 18 months, our continued strong momentum, our breadth of technology combined with our clear application leadership, and the benefits of scale as one of the largest pure-play additive manufacturing companies, we entered 2022 with a great deal of optimism.
Specifically, we'd expect that over the next 18 months, we will refresh our entire lineup of metal and polymer hardware platforms while continuing to release record numbers of new materials and improvements to our software products offered through Oqton.
In the coming years, we're confident that this focused approach and simple business model will result in consistent year over year double-digit organic growth with expanding gross margins, our goal of which is to exceed 50% over time.

I will begin by noting that we issued a $460 million five-year convertible bond in the fourth quarter.
The marketing of our bond met with a very healthy demand, and we were able to issue our bond at a 0% coupon, providing the company with a significant arsenal for investment with very low carrying costs.
After completing this bond offering and combined with our previous activities of divesting noncore assets, making strategic organic investments and generating $48.1 million of cash from operations, we ended the year with $789.7 million of cash on hand, an increase of $705.3 million from the beginning of 2021.
For full year 2022, we expect revenue to be within a range of $570 million and $630 million, non-GAAP gross margins to be between 40 and 44%, and non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 225 million and $250 million.
