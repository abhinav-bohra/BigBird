Our MRO job inductions metrics, which serve as an early indicator for carrier traffic recovery, increased 37% for the quarter with a 6% sequential increase overall led by engine accessories and the sales structures.
Aftermarket spares and repairs, sales were up overall more than 70% for the quarter.
Orders for the A320 and 737 MAX have seen new highs since the beginning of the pandemic.
I want to congratulate Boeing for completing the first flight of the 737 MAX-10 on June 18, which was followed by June 29 order from United Airlines for 150 aircraft.
Orders for commercial transport aircraft are up in 2021 as Airbus and Boeing have reported 721 new orders, offset by 476 cancellations.
Bright spots include United's June order for 737 MAX and A321neo aircraft, the FedEx order for 767, and the May Southwest Airlines orders for the MAX.
Commercial transport backlog now stands at approximately 12,000 aircraft.
Boeing recently announced a slowing of the 787 production rate.
Triumph had already de-risked its twin-aisle build rates with our 787's percentage of sales and inventory, reflecting conservative assumptions.
After 18 months of uncertainty, we have more clarity on near-term OEM and MRO demands as markets continue to stabilize, and we see lift from military and cargo demand.
Triumph has launched an energy conservation project in our largest production facility, which will reduce electrical power use by 25% annually.
We are on track to complete our final 747 production components this month, and in the last of our significant loss-making programs.
First, organic growth was 11%, led by improved MRO and aftermarket spare sales within our core Systems and Support business.
OEM sales were driven by Airbus A320, 321 shipments, Bell 429 gearboxes and E2D actuation.
Systems & Support revenues for our third-party MRO increased 19%, while proprietary spare sales, primarily for military rotorcraft and commercial narrow-body production rates, more than offset commercial widebody declines.
Shipments to FedEx and UPS are up 52% for the quarter as cargo aircraft returned for deferred maintenance.
Military sales now comprise 53% of our sales in Systems & Support helping to offset the temporary commercial aerospace decline.
Military platforms such as the E2D, UH-60 and CH-47 contributed to the sequential sales growth driving a 12% increase in our military sales year-over-year.
As mentioned, we will deliver our final 747 structures this month, at which point Triumph will fulfill our program obligations.
We will close the second of two large structures facilities dedicated to the 747 in December, ending a long period of losses.
Early indicators within the aviation industry indicate steady progress in the quarter toward 2019 levels with airline travel bookings improving from 46% to 69% and corporate bookings up from 18% to 40% as strong summer bookings benefited domestic carriers.
Reflecting a return to airline normalcy and profitability, average airfare prices, weekly load factors and TSA throughput continue to recover in the U.S. Parked fleets have declined substantially with over 1,800 aircraft returned to service since March.
As you know, the single-aisle segment will lead the aviation recovery, gratifying the OEM single-aisle deliveries for both Boeing and Airbus increase each month within the quarter, culminating in strong June numbers with Airbus delivering 62 single aisles and Boeing delivering 36.
We are upgrading heat exchangers on the F-22 F119 engine for Pratt & Whitney, where we have significant IP.
95% of our heat exchangers are designed and developed by Triumph engineering teams.
We secured orders from GE for the F/A-18 E/F, F414 aircraft-mounted accessory drives.
This complex gearbox builds on the legacy of our F/A-18 C&D gearbox for the F404 engine.
Sales are up 11% organically.
Q1 adjusted operating income was $31 million.
Adjusted operating margin was 8%, up 477 basis points from the prior year.
With respect to the segment results, on slide 11, net sales in Systems & Support were up 8%, and benefited from continued recovery in the aftermarket.
This segment sales were 53% military this quarter, up from 51% in the prior year quarter.
Adjusted operating margins for Systems & Support was 14%, 235 basis point improvement from the prior year, and benefited from increasing MRO demand.
First quarter net sales for structures increased 15%, largely due to the prior year's impacts of the pandemic after adjusting for divestitures and the sunsetting 747 and G280 programs.
The continuing business is stable and improving as evidenced by the 10% adjusted operating margin compared to 1% in the prior year.
During the quarter, I visited our Grand Prairie, Texas facility and saw the significant progress our team has achieved to successfully complete the production of the 747 later this month.
In Q1, we retired $100 million of discrete cash obligations related to advances, settlements, restructuring and wind down of 747 production.
Excluding these sunsetting uses of cash, we used $51 million of cash in the first quarter on modest working capital growth in support of anticipated production rate increases, primarily on commercial narrow-body platforms.
Our net debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.4 billion, and our combined cash and availability was about $263 million.
In the quarter, we completed the mandatory paydown of approximately $112 million of first lien notes and redeemed the remaining $236 million of outstanding 22 notes.
Based on anticipated aircraft production rates, and excluding the impacts of potential divestitures, for FY '22, we expect revenue of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.
We expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.61.
Cash taxes, net of refunds received, is expected to be approximately $4 million for the year, while interest expense is expected to be approximately $140 million, including approximately $137 million of cash interest.
After approximately $150 million of free cash use in the first quarter, we expect in total to generate free cash flow over the balance of the year, with about $40 million to $60 million of use in Q2, approximately breakeven in Q3 and solidly cash positive in Q4.
For the full year, we expect to use $110 million to $125 million of cash from operations with approximately $25 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash use of $135 million to $150 million.
