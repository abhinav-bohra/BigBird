Yesterday, we reported solid second quarter results, underpinned by strong top line growth as a result of the pockets of attractive pricing and volume, resulting in an annualized return on average equity in the first half of 2020 of 15.5%.
Clovered continues to be an attractive growth opportunity for us with approximately 40% premium growth from the year ago quarter to its total book of business, while growing non risk bearing business by over 200% in the same time period.
Clovered represents Universal Property & Casualty's fastest growing agency across it's nearly 10,000 independent agents.
EPS for the quarter was $0.62 on a GAAP basis and $0.52 on a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share basis, and $1.23 and $1.32 for the first half of 2020, respectively.
Direct premiums written were up 13.1% for the quarter, led by strong direct premium growth of 14.5% in states outside of Florida and 12.8% in Florida.
For the first half of 2020, direct premiums written were also up double digits, led by 16.5% in states outside Florida and 13.8% in Florida.
On the expense side, the combined ratio increased 12.6 points for the quarter to 99.5% and 9.8 points for the first half of 2020 to 96.8%.
Total services revenue increased 16.8% to $16.1 million for the quarter and 20.9% to $31.5 million for the first half of 2020, driven primarily by commission revenue earned on ceded premiums.
On our investment portfolio, net investment income decreased 16.6% to $6.2 million for the quarter and 16.3% to $13 million for the first half of 2020, primarily due to lower yields on cash and short term investments during the first half of 2020 when compared to the first half of 2019.
Also to note, we had an increase in our cash and cash equivalents position by 82.2% when compared to the end of 2019 as a result of taking a defensive posture as COVID-19 impacts continue to be felt across the global economy.
In regards to capital deployment, during the second quarter, the company repurchased approximately 572,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $10 million.
For the first half of 2020, the company repurchased approximately 884,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $16.6 million.
The company's current share repurchase authorization program has $11.7 million remaining as of June 30, 2020, and runs through December 31, 2021.
On July 6, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share payable on August 7, 2020, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on July 31, 2020.
We now expect a GAAP earnings per share range from $2.31 to $2.61 and a non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share range of $2.40 to $2.70, assuming no extraordinary weather in the latter half of 2020 and no realized or unrealized gains for the second half of 2020.
This would yield a return on average equity derived from GAAP measures between 13.5% and 16.5% for the full year.
As of 6/30, Hurricanes Matthew and Florence each were in the single-digit open claims and continue to be very near the end.
Hurricane Michael had a little over 100 claims open.
And as we start to approach the end on this storm, we did elect to book a modest $9.5 million increase in gross ultimate as of 6/30.
On Hurricane Irma, despite the fact that 1,800 new claims were reported during the second quarter, we still successfully reduced the remaining open claim count.
As of 6/30, the open Irma account stood at just over 450 we are preparing for the three year statute of limitation for filing new Irma claims to pass in early September, so we can make a final push on closing this event.
There was no change to the ultimate as of 6/30.
We were directly impacted by 14 different second quarter PCS events, which led us to book an additional $17 million of net pre-tax loss beyond our original weather loss plan as of 6/30.
The final estimated cost was in line with our original guidance at approximately 34.6% of estimated direct earned premium for the 12-month treaty period.
This compares to 33.3% at this time last year, reflecting a 4.1% increase year-over-year.
