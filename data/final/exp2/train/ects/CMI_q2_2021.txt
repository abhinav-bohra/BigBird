As part of our alliance, Cummins will be the electrolyzer supplier for a 230 megawatt project for a leading fertilizer producer that will serve as a benchmark for large PEM scale electrolysis globally.
As one of the largest hydrogen suppliers in China, Sinopec's annual hydrogen production reaches 3.5 million tons, accounting for 14% of total -- China's total hydrogen production.
Following successful demonstration, the project includes ramp-ups, which -- with a total of 2,000 trucks to be delivered by the middle of the decade.
We've now deployed more than 2,000 fuel cells and 600 electrolyzers around the world as we continue the development of our hydrogen business.
Site selection search within the Guadalajara area of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain is currently underway for Cummins new approximately $60 million PEM electrolyzer manufacturing plant that will house system assembly and testing for approximately 500 megawatts per year of electrolyzer production and will be scalable to more than one gigawatt per year.
The JV will initially invest $47 million to locate a manufacturing plant to produce PEM electrolyzers.
The plant will open with a manufacturing capacity of 500 megawatts of electrolyzers per year, but will also be scalable to more than one gigawatt per year.
