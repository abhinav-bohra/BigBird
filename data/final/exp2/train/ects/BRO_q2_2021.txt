Our performance for the first six months of 2021 is due to the tremendous effort of our talented 11,000-plus teammates that deliver creative risk management solutions for our customers.
We delivered $727 million of revenue, growing 21.5% in total and 14.7% organically.
Our EBITDAC margin was 32.9%, which is up 340 basis points from the second quarter of 2020.
Our net income per share for the second quarter was $0.49, increasing 44% on an as-reported and adjusted basis, with the latter excluding the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables.
However, not all companies are back at 100%, and we continue to hear about struggles with certain customer segments in hiring workers.
Admitted rates continue to be up 3% to 7% across most lines.
the outliers are workers' compensation rates which remain down 1% to 3% and commercial auto rates which were up 5% to 10%.

Coastal property, both wind and quake, are up 15% to 25%.
Professional liability rates are generally up 10% to 25%-plus, cyber rates are generally up 10% to 20%-plus, with increased underwriting questions and some reduction in coverage availability.

For the second quarter, we delivered total revenue growth of $128.5 million or 21.5% and organic revenue growth of 14.7%.
EBITDAC increased by 35.4%, which expanded EBITDAC margin by 340 basis points, despite lower margin associated with certain acquisitions completed in the past few quarters and slightly higher travel costs.
Income before income taxes increased by 44%, growing faster than EBITDAC due to a lower growth rate in amortization and interest expense, as well as a decrease in acquisition earn-out payables.

Organic growth for the quarter was positively impacted by, approximately, 300 basis points due to the $8 million adjustment recorded in the second quarter of last year for the economic disruption associated with the pandemic.
EBITDAC margin for the quarter increased by 510 basis points and EBITDAC grew 55.1% due to the leveraging of higher organic revenue along with a gain on disposal associated with the sale of certain books of business.
Income before income tax margin increased 580 basis points, growing faster than EBITDAC, driven primarily by amortization and intercompany interest expense growing at a slower rate than EBITDAC.
Moving over to slide number 10.
Our National Programs segment increased total revenue by 14% and organic revenue by 13.3%.
Regarding outlook for the last two quarters of 2021, we wanted to highlight that we anticipate approximately $4 million to $6 million of revenue shifting from the third quarter to the fourth quarter due to renewal timing for certain accounts.
EBITDAC increased by $7.9 million or 12.6%, growing slightly slower than total revenues due to incremental costs associated with onboarding new customers, increased non-cash stock-based compensation, and slightly higher variable cost.
