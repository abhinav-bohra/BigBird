We generated $418 million of adjusted EBITDA this quarter, an increase of 4% as compared to last year.
Profitability for the quarter was held back by factors I mentioned earlier, energy inflation was a significant $30 million headwind.
Unit diesel prices were up over 50%, leading to $14 million of additional expense.
The cost of liquid asphalt was over $100 per ton higher than last year.
This sharp increase impacted our results by $16 million.
Even with these headwinds, we improved our aggregate cash gross profit per ton by 3% and to $7.74.
This strong performance and the momentum it provides sets us up well for 22, especially with respect to pricing.
Total aggregate volume, including U.S. Concrete, increased by 8% versus last years quarter.
On a same-store basis, volume was up 5%.
Same-store prices were up 3.1% in the quarter and mix adjusted prices increased by 3.5%.
On a same-store basis, our aggregates unit cost of sales in the quarter increased by only 1.7% as compared to last year.
Now excluding the diesel effect, unit cost of sales actually decreased by 1%.
Quarterly gross profit in the segment fell from $30 million to $7 million.
Higher liquid asphalt costs accounted for $16 million of this difference.
Asphalt volume declined by 8% as volume growth in California was more than offset by lower Arizona volumes due to extremely wet weather.
Average selling prices improved by almost 2% year-over-year and better than 2% sequentially, evidence that pricing actions are beginning to ease some of the illiquid asphalt inflation.
In the Concrete segment, gross profit increased by 18%, reflecting our ownership of U.S. Concrete for one month.
Same-store volumes declined by 7% due to the completion of large projects in Virginia and the availability of drivers to make up for any lost shipping days.
For the quarter, same-store prices increased by 2%.
We are confident in our ability to generate at least $50 million of synergies on a 12-month run basis beginning midyear next year, when most of the integration is complete, but more to come.
But at this stage, I would be surprised if next years price increases are not at least 5%.
Due to our strong cash generation, we were able to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio to 2.7 times following the U.S. Concrete acquisition.
This is just above our stated range of two to 2.5 times and we will be focused on getting back within that range in the near term.
For Legacy Vulcan, the return was 14.7%, up 240 basis points from three years ago, with the inclusion of one month of U.S. Concrete earnings, and a 1-quarter impact of the acquisition on average invested capital, our return was 14.2%.
Our adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the full year is now $1.43 billion to $1.46 billion.
This includes $50 million to $60 million of EBITDA from the acquisition, but excludes $115 million gain on a land sale completed in the first quarter.
