Persistency improved 180 basis points to 80.1%.
63 basis points of the elevated persistency in both the second quarter of this year and the prior year can be explained by emergency orders.
80 basis points of improved persistency in the quarter is attributed to lower sales, as first year lapse rates are roughly twice total in-force lapse rates.
Another 30 basis points of improved persistency is due to conservation efforts, and the remainder largely comes from improved experience.
Our total benefit ratio came in lower than expected at 43.5% or 80 basis points lower than Q2 2020, which, itself, was heavily impacted by the initial pandemic.

Initial expectations were for us to be toward the low end of 16% to 19%.
In our Corporate segment, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $76 million, as adjusted net investment income was $45 million lower than last year due to low interest rates at the short end of the yield curve and amortization of certain tax credit investments, which amounted to $30 million this quarter held at the corporate level.
Our capital position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with an SMR above 900% in Japan and an RBC of approximately 600% in Aflac Columbus.
