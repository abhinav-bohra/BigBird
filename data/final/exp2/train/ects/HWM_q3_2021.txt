The combination of debt actions in the third quarter, combined with our first half results and actions, will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $70 million.
In the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 770,000 shares of common stock for $25 million, which increases share repurchases year-to-date to approximately seven million shares for $225 million.
The net result of all these actions plus the reinstatement of the common stock dividend and the $115 million cash inflow resulted in a cash balance of $726 million, similar to that at the end of Q2.
Lastly, we continue to focus on legacy liabilities and have reduced pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $180 million year-to-date.
Moreover, year-to-date pension and OPEB expenses have reduced by approximately 50% compared to last year.

Incremental margins for Engine Products were approximately 70% for the quarter despite hiring back approximately 500 workers to prepare for future growth.
Operating margin improved 1,200 basis points year-over-year.
Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 6% lower in the third quarter.
Commercial Aerospace was 25% lower as we saw continued production declines for the Boeing 787 and customer inventory corrections.
The commercial transportation and industrial markets within the Fastening Systems segments were approximately 55% and 19% year-over-year, respectively.
Year-over-year Fastening Systems was able to generate $14 million more in operating profit, while revenue declined $17 million.
As a result, operating margin improved 630 basis points.
Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the third quarter.
Commercial Aerospace was 13% higher as the narrow-body recovery was partially offset by production declines for the Boeing 787.
Defense Aerospace was down 21% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially.
Year-over-year, Engineered Structures was able to generate $4 million more in operating profit on $7 million of lower revenue.
As a result, operating margin improved 210 basis points.
Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 34% higher in the third quarter.
The segment was able to overcome a 4% decrease in volume due to customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production, and a 13% increase in aluminum prices to maintain a healthy operating margin of approximately 27%.
Year-over-year incremental margins for Forged Wheels were approximately 45% for the quarter.
First, in the first half of the year, we paid down approximately $835 million of debt by completing the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand.
The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $47 million.
Second, in the third quarter we tendered $600 million of our 6.875% notes due in 2025 and issued $700 million of 3% notes due in 2029.
The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $20 million.
Third, with cash on hand, we repurchased $100 million of our 2021 notes through an open market repurchase in Q3 and in October, which neutralized the gross debt impact of the tender and refinancing.
The annualized interest expense saving with this action is approximately $5 million.
As a result of these actions, we have lowered annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million and smoothed out our future debt maturities.
At the end of Q3, gross debt was approximately $4.2 billion, which is similar to Q2.
Net debt to EBITDA improved from 3.5 times in Q2 to 3.2 times despite the deployment of cash for debt refinancing, share buybacks and dividends.
Finally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Special items for the third quarter were a net charge of approximately $93 million, mainly driven by the costs associated with the bond tender and refinancing completed in the quarter.
As expected, Howmet transitioned to revenue growth in the third quarter, and we expect year-over-year revenue growth will continue into the fourth quarter and to 2022, with a growth of approximately 12% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth in the fourth quarter of approximately 6%.
We expect modest sequential growth in Q4 for Engineered Structures despite continued delays with the 787.
In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following: In terms of guidance for Q4, I'll just call out the midpoints, as you can read the slide: Revenue, $1.315 billion; EBITDA, $300 million; EBITDA margin, 22.8%; earnings per share of $0.29.
And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5 billion, plus or minus; EBITDA at $1.135 billion; EBITDA margin at 22.7%; earnings per share increased to $1 per share; and cash flow of $450 million.
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we expect the following: Second half revenue to be up approximately 8% versus the first half driven by Commercial Aerospace, Commercial Transportation and IGTT; Q4 sequential segment incremental operating margins, we expect to be in the order of 28%.
Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020, the cost-reduction carryover of $100 million, as already commented, is exceeded.
Pension and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million and capex should be in the range of $180 million to $200 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million.
Adjusted free cash flow compared to net income continues to be approximately 100%.
An early approximate total revenue guide would be for an increase in annual revenues of 12% to 15%, led by recovery in Commercial Aerospace.
The fourth quarter, for our -- revenue outlook is $30 million higher than the third quarter, with margins of approximately 23%, which sets a platform for a healthy 2022.
