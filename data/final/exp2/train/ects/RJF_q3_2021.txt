Record quarterly net revenues of $2.47 billion, grew 35% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.
Record asset management fees grew 8% sequentially, commensurate with a sequential increase of fee-based assets in the preceding quarter.
Private Client Group assets and fee-based accounts were up 9% during the fiscal third quarter, providing a tailwind for this line item for the fourth quarter.
Consolidated brokerage revenue is $552 million, grew 14% over the prior year, but declined 7% from the record set and the preceding quarter.
Brokerage revenues and PCG were up 22% on a year-over-year basis, but down 6% sequentially due to lower trading volumes, as well as the large placement fee in the preceding quarter.
Account and service fees of $161 million increased 20% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, largely due to higher average mutual fund balances.
Record consolidated investment banking revenues of $276 million, grew 99% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, driven by record M&A revenues, and strong debt and equity underwriting results.
So we would be pleased if fourth quarter revenues came in around the average of the quarterly revenues generated over the first three quarters of the fiscal year, that would have been about $260 million on average.
Other revenues of $55 million were up 25% sequentially, primarily due to $24 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter, of which approximately $10 million were attributable to non-controlling interest, which are reflected in the other expenses.
Clients domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at $62.9 billion, essentially flat compared to the preceding quarter and representing 6.1% of domestic PCG client assets.
As we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third-party banks during fiscal 2021, $8.6 billion of the client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer.
The combined net interest income and BDPs from third-party banks of $183 million were up slightly compared to the preceding quarter, as modest NIM compression was offset by growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances in Raymond James Bank.
However, it s still down significantly from the peak of $329 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, really highlighting the remarkable results we have been able to generate despite near zero short-term interest rates.
We continue to expect the bank s NIM to decline to just around or just below 1.9% over the next quarter or two.
The average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks declined 1 basis point to 29 basis points in the quarter.
First, our largest expense compensation; the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 69.5% to 67.2% largely due to record revenues in the capital markets segment, which had a 57% comp ratio during the quarter.
Given our current revenue mix and disciplined manage of expenses, we remain confident, we can maintain a compensation ratio lower than 70% in this near zero short-term interest rate environment.
Non-compensation expenses of $425 million, increased 18% compared to last year s third quarter and 53% sequentially, primarily driven by the $98 million loss on extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related expenses, the non-controlling interest of $10 million and other expenses related to our private equity valuation gains and higher business development expenses.
We raised $750 million of 30-year senior note at 3.75% and utilize the proceeds and cash on hand to early redeem our next two senior notes that we re maturing in 2024 and 2026, effectively, resulting in the same amount of senior notes outstanding.
This resulted in $98 million in losses associated with the early extinguishment of those nodes, but in doing so locked in very low rates for 30 years, while significantly extending the duration and stability of our funding profile.
Pretax margin was 15.6% in fiscal third quarter of 2021 and adjusted pre-tax margin was 19.8%, which was boosted by record revenues, the loan loss reserve release and still relatively subdued business development expenses.
At our Analyst and Investor Day in June, we outlined a pre-tax margin target of 15% to 16% in this near zero interest rate environment.
On slide 14, at the end of the quarter, total assets were approximately $57.2 billion, a 2% sequential increasing increase, reflecting solid growth of securities-based loans at Raymond James Bank.
Liquidity and capital levels are very strong, with cash at the parent of approximately $1.56 billion, a total capital ratio of 25.5% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6%.
The third quarter effective tax rate of 20.3% benefited from non-taxable gains in the corporate life insurance portfolio, we would expect that tax rate to be around 21% in the fiscal fourth quarter, assuming a flat equity market.
In the third quarter, we repurchased 375,000 shares for $48 million.
As of July 28, $632 million remains available under the current share repurchase authorization.
Non-performing assets remained low at just 12 basis points of total assets and criticized loans declined sequentially.
The bank loan loss benefit of $19 million reflects an improved outlook for economic conditions and higher credit ratings on average within the corporate loan portfolio.
Due to reserve releases and loan growth during the quarter, the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans declined from 1.5% to 1.34% of the quarter end.
For the corporate portfolio, these allowances are higher at around 2.4%.
In the Private Client Group results will benefit by starting the fourth quarter with 9% increase of assets and fee-based accounts.
