I am pleased to report solid fourth quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $1.11.
This performance was 63% above the same quarter last year despite the effects of the semiconductor chip shortage and ongoing global supply chain disruptions, as well as a higher level of maintenance spending due to the timing of turnarounds.
