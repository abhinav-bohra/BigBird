RevPAR growth in the United States was the primary driver of the jump in systemwide RevPAR improving 75% in the second quarter over the first quarter and more than double a 30% aggregate growth rate for the remainder of the world.
To give you a sense of the disparity as of mid-July, geographic areas such as Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East are trending at less than 50% of fully recovered RevPAR levels, while the United States, Mainland China and the Caribbean are over 80% recovered.
In January, comparable US resort RevPAR was down 75% versus 2019.
In June, just five months later, RevPAR was 11% above 2019 with strong average rate growth in June of over 25% compared to 2019 levels.
This trend has only accelerated further in July with leisure transient nearly 20% ahead of 2019 levels in the United States and even stronger in Mainland China.

As we look to 2022, while group is down in the mid-teens compared to 2019, our leads are tracking 30% higher, which suggests that our pace deficit should improve.

We've opened 100 hotels over the trailing 12 months, a record level of organic expansion leading to net room growth of 7.1% in the second quarter.
Even with our rapid rate of hotel openings, we've maintained our pipeline of signed deals in a challenging environment, closing the second quarter with a development pipeline of 100,000, 101,000 rooms representing over 40% of our existing lease base.
Already through the first half of the year, the number of hotels in these four brands have expanded by 20% and we expect to end the year with growth of 30% or more.
It's exciting to see how these brands have been so quickly adopted by our loyal guests with the World of Hyatt program driving over 40% of room nights.
RevPAR index for comparable former Two Roads hotels is up 13% versus 2019 through the first half of this year.
In the span of just three years, we tripled the number of lifestyle insofar properties from approximately 50 to 150, accounting for nearly 40% of total hotel openings over that time frame.

With the completion of these asset transactions, we've realized net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion since the time of our announcement in March of 2019.
In addition to these transactions, I'm pleased to note that we are in advanced stages for the disposition of two other assets in the aggregate amount of $500 million.
Should we successfully close these two transactions, we will exceed our $1.5 billion asset sell-down commitment and do so well before our target date and at an aggregate multiple in the high teens.
In total, from the outset of our asset sell-down strategy announcement in November of 2017, and assuming the closing of the sale of the two properties in process, we will have sold over $3 billion of assets at an average EBITDA multiple of just under 17.5 times, demonstrating the valuations realized in our disposition efforts are materially in excess of the implied valuation, the market has placed on our owned and leased business.

Owned and leased RevPAR was $87 for the second quarter, experiencing strong acceleration throughout the quarter with RevPAR improving from $73 in April to $107 in June, nearly doubling the rate of improvement of our systemwide portfolio.

Preliminary RevPAR for the owned and leased portfolio in July is approximately $135, up nearly 30% from June, and nearly 85% recovered versus the same month in 2019.

Turning to net rooms growth, earlier this quarter in connection with the pending our agreement with Service Properties Trust, which extended our management of 17 high-place hotels that we previously forecasted to exit the system, we increased our net rooms growth projection to approximately 6%, up from greater than 5% as previously reported in the first quarter of 2021.
We're updating this expectation of net rooms growth to be greater than 6% for the year.
Our previously communicated earnings sensitivity levels illustrated that a 1% change in RevPAR level using 2019 RevPAR as a baseline resulted in an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in adjusted EBITDA.
As the relationship between owned and leased systemwide RevPAR has formalized, the earnings sensitivity is now expected to improve toward the midpoint of the $10 million to $15 million range of adjusted EBITDA, reflecting our ability to mitigate the adjusted EBITDA downside impact relative to our 2019 results.
