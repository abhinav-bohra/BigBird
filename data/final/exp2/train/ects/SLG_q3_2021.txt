At 11 a.m., we cut the ribbon in the transcendence room, high above One Vanderbilt with the most incredible and amplified views of New York City.
As a result, we are now more than 90% leased despite COVID, and despite every dire prediction of the city's demise.
On certain days of the week, we are reaching nearly 40% physical occupancy in our portfolio, a substantial increase that's been building up over the past few weeks.
With over 450,000 square feet leased in the third quarter in our portfolio and nearly 1.4 million square feet leased in SL Green portfolio to date, we are tracking well ahead of our leasing goals for the year.
It's a 56,000 square foot lease to one of the best operators of fitness, wellness and health in New York City.
And that really bodes well for one Madison, which otherwise is already about six to seven weeks ahead of schedule on construction and significantly under budget, even beyond the numbers that we discussed back in December of last year, the buyouts, which now stand at close to 92% of the total project, have resulted in over $12 million of additional contingency savings.
Most significantly, the consummation of the sale of about a 50% interest to institutional -- overseas institutional investor in the News Building.
That, of course, enabled us to repurchase about an additional $80 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which brings us close, but not completely rounded out -- I'm sorry, in the third quarter, my mistake.
$80 million of stock in the third quarter.
