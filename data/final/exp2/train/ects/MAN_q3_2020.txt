Reported operating profit margin was 1.3%, down 280 basis points from the prior year and, after excluding the restructuring and other special items, operating profit margin was 2.6%, down 100 basis points from the prior year.
Reported earnings per diluted share of $0.18 reflects the impact of restructuring charges, the loss on dispositions and a discrete tax item.
Excluding the restructuring and other special items, our earnings per diluted share was $1.20 for the quarter representing a decrease of 39% in constant currency.
Earlier this year we asked more than 30,000 employers across 40 plus countries when they predicted hiring would return to pre-pandemic levels.
The same survey we conducted three months later shows that 60% now think it will take even longer, toward the end of '21, the much talked about U shaped recovery.
One of our main innovation initiatives is our MyPath program which is now scaling to 14 markets this year and next across both our Manpower and Experis brands.
We have also upskilled more than 2,000 of our own Talent Agents to be expert in assessment and data-driven recruitment and continue to improve on reassignment rates, improved utilization rates and increased satisfaction levels with those clients and candidates that engage in MyPath.
We also continue to invest in our Center of Excellence in People Analytics and Assessment, led by our Chief Talent and Data Scientist and a 40 plus strong global innovation team.
On a reported basis, our operating profit was $62 million.
Excluding special items consisting of restructuring charges and a loss on dispositions, our operating profit was $117 million, representing a decline of 37%, or a decline of 38% on a constant currency basis.
This resulted in an operating profit margin of 2.6% before restructuring charges and other special items, which was above the high end of our guidance.
Breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail, after adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 2%, our constant currency revenue declined 14.5%.
The impact of acquisitions and billing days were minor resulting in an organic days adjusted revenue decrease of 15%.
This represented a significant improvement from the second quarter revenue decline of 27% on a similar basis.
On a reported basis, earnings per share was $0.18, which included the restructuring charges of $50 million which represented a negative $0.72, certain discrete tax charges of $12 million and a loss from dispositions of $6 million which combined had a $0.30 negative impact.
Excluding the restructuring and other special items, earnings per share was $1.20, which exceeded our guidance range.
Included within this result was improved operational performance of $0.47, $0.03 on better than expected foreign currency exchange rates before restructuring and other special items, $0.04 on an improved effective tax rate and $0.03 on improved interest and other expenses.
Our gross margin came in at 15.8%.
Underlying staffing margin contributed to a 20 basis points reduction and a lower contribution from permanent recruitment contributed to a 30 basis point reduction.
This was offset by 20 basis points of increased gross profit margin from career transition growth within Right Management.
Other and accrual adjustments include about 20 basis points of favorable direct cost adjustments in France partially offset by decreased margin in our Proservia managed services business.

Excluding the special items, SG&A of $608 million represented a decrease of $46 million from the prior year after excluding the prior year gain on the China IPO.
This underlying decrease was driven by $60 million of operational cost reductions offset by an increase of $12 million from currency changes and $2 million from acquisitions.
On an organic constant currency basis, excluding special items, SG&A expenses decreased 9% year-over-year.
SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in the quarter represented 13.3%, excluding restructuring and other special items, which continued to reflect the significant deleveraging on the material drop in revenues year-over-year.
The Americas segment comprised 20% of consolidated revenue.
Revenue in the quarter was $929 million, a decrease of 11% in constant currency.

Within Right Management in the US, revenues increased 30% year-over-year driven by significant career transition activity during the quarter.

Revenue growth in Japan was up 5% on a constant currency basis and, after adjusting for billing days, this represented a 6% growth rate which was equal to the growth rate in the second quarter.

During the third quarter, free cash flow equaled $108 million compared to $206 million in the prior year quarter.
Capital expenditures represented $31 million during the first nine months of the year.
We did not purchase any shares of stock during the third quarter and our year-to-date purchases stand at 871,000 shares of stock for $64 million.
As of September 30, we have 5.9 million shares remaining for repurchase under the 6 million share program approved in August of 2019.
Our balance sheet was strong at quarter-end with cash of $1.59 billion and total debt of $1.09 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $500 million.
Our debt ratios remain comfortable at quarter-end with total gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA of 2.21 times and total debt to total capitalization at 29%.
In addition, our revolving credit facility for $600 million remained unused.
On that basis, we are forecasting earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.06 to $1.14, which includes a favorable impact from foreign currency of $0.03 per share.
Our constant currency revenue guidance range is between a decline of 10% to a decline of 12%.
The mid-point of our constant currency guidance, a decline of 11%, also reflects the organic days-adjusted rate of decline as billing days for Q4 are only very slightly higher year-over-year and the impact of net dispositions is also very slight.
This represents an improvement of about 4% from the organic days adjusted constant currency decline of 15% in the third quarter.
We expect our operating profit margin during the fourth quarter to be down 130 basis points compared to the prior year.
We expect our income tax rate in the fourth quarter to approximate 39% which continues to reflect an outsized impact of the French Business Tax effect that I discussed in previous quarters.
France is planning to reduce the French Business Tax, known as CVAE, by 50% in 2021.
If the budget is approved as drafted, this would improve our pre-crisis level global effective tax rate by 3% to 3.5%.
Additionally, France has indicated that they will continue with their multi-year corporate tax reform schedule which is expected to separately reduce the France corporate tax rate by about 3% next year and the impact to the consolidated effective tax rate is a reduction between 50 and 75 basis points.
As usual, our guidance does not incorporate restructuring charges or additional share repurchases and we estimate our weighted average shares to be 58.6 million.
