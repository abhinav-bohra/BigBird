Third quarter net income of $34.1 million produced core earnings per share of $0.36, accompanied by core return on assets of 1.43% and core pre-tax pre-provision ROA of 1.79%.
Other headlines for the quarter include first, excluding PPP loan payoffs, we're pleased with loan growth of 8.2% or $132.3 million in the third quarter with ongoing strength in indirect lending, home equity lending, commercial lending and mortgage lending.
Second, the loan growth and improved margin enabled a $2.4 million quarter-over-quarter increase in net interest income to $70.9 million.
Third, non-interest income or fees grew $1.2 million quarter-over-quarter to $27.2 million on the strength of improvement in SBA and mortgage gain on sale income as well as higher wealth management income.
Importantly, our card-related interchange business generated $7.1 million in fee income.
Fourth, our efficiency ratio increased to 55.27% as core non-interest expense rose some $3.7 million, primarily due to higher personnel expense, including higher incentive accruals based upon increased production, higher wages, particularly in entry level positions driven by inflationary pressure, higher hospitalization expense and then the hiring of the management team of the equipment finance division.
The third quarter represented our lowest loan charge-offs in nine quarters, a decrease in specific reserves for troubled credits coupled with general improvement in economic conditions led to a provision of just $330,000 down from $5.4 million in the second quarter.
Our reserves now represent 1.3% of total loans, excluding PPP and a 247% of non-performing loans.
The level of non-performing loans improved significantly from $52.8 million in the second quarter to just $38.1 million in the third quarter or 56 basis points of total loans.
Similarly, non-performing assets of $39 million at quarter end now stand at 41 basis points of total assets.
Subsequent to quarter end in early October a $6.9 million troubled credit was resolved and will be reflected in Q4 results.
We continue to be pleased with our adoption of our new mobile banking app, which is growing at an annualized rate of 18%.
We expect the average ticket size to be about $80,000 and an average term of 60 months.
Based on the historical performance of this team, we expect yields in the mid-5% range and spreads in the mid-4% range with charge-offs typically ranging from 55 basis points to 75 basis points.
If all goes according to plan, we believe that we can generate some $200 million to $250 million of equipment finance assets on our books by the end of 2022 before really hitting our stride in '23 and '24.
The GAAP net interest margin expanded by 6 basis points this quarter to 3.33%.
Net expansion was driven by strong organic loan growth of just over 8% annualized.
Total PPP income in the third quarter was $5.7 million, up by only $200,000 from last quarter.
As of September 30, we had $152 million of PPP remaining on the books with $6.3 million in fee income that remains to be recognized.
The core NIM which we calculate to exclude the effects of PPP and excess cash fell from 3.20% last quarter to 3.16% this quarter because we purchased $134 million of securities in the quarter.
Had we not purchased the securities and just let the money sit in cash, we would have excluded that cash from the core NIM calculation based on the way we calculate it and the core NIM would have dropped by only 1 basis point to 3.19%.
Our cost of deposits in the third quarter was down to only 6 basis points.
I'm pleased to report that our last remaining tranche of high cost deposits totaling $52 million at a cost of 1.65% repriced on October 13 subsequent to quarter end.
That alone will save us nearly $1 million a year in interest expense at about a point of NIM.
With that behind us, we're down to about $400 million in time deposits remaining at a cost of 36 basis points, three quarters of which will mature by the end of 2022.
In light of unprecedented levels of liquidity, we are revising our interest rate risk assumptions to reflect the ability to lag deposit rate increases for the first two 25 basis point rate hikes.
You'll see this in our IRR tables once we published our 10-Q but to give you a preview a 100 basis point parallel shock will show an increase in the first year net interest income of over 5%.
Turning now to fee income; fee income of $27.2 million in the quarter remains a bright spot and seems to be one aspect of our company that is consistently underappreciated.
There's been talk of slowdown in mortgage all year but our mortgage gain on sale income actually increased by $400,000 over the last quarter.
SBA is another fee income engine that continues to gain momentum now that PPP is mostly behind us with SBA gear and sale income up by $700,000 from last quarter to $2.4 million.
Card related interchange income continues at new record levels for us of approximately $7 million a quarter, and deposit service charges after the off pace for much of the pandemic due to heightened cash levels and customer accounts have returned to more normalized levels.
Turning to non-interest expense, last quarter, our guidance was $53 million to $54 million, and we came in at $55 million for the reasons Mike described.
Finally, we repurchased 997,517 shares of stock during the third quarter at an average price of $13.35.
While we ended the quarter with approximately $10.3 million remaining of our $25 million share repurchase authorization we are also pleased to announce that our board authorized an additional $25 million share repurchase authorization yesterday.
