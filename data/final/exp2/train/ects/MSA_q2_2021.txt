With annual revenue of about $70 million, it's headquartered here in Pittsburgh, not far from our gas detection center of excellence, where we've recently made significant investments.
If we add Bacharach into our quarter end net leverage, the pro forma would be about 1.7 times net.

This has resulted in backlog increasing 15% from the end of Q1, particularly in gas detection products.

Quarterly SG&A also includes about $8 million of costs related to Bacharach and and Bristol acquisitions, including the stock compensation of about $4 million adjustment that I spoke about previously.
Bacharach transaction costs of about $2 million and the remainder being the Bristol base SG&A.
We expect SG&A to approximate 23.5% of sales for the second half of 2021.
We invested $7 million in restructuring programs in the quarter, primarily in our International segment as we continue to execute on our margin expansion road map.

We continue to expect Bacharach to provide $0.10 to $0.15 of adjusted earnings per share in the second half of 2021.
In connection with the acquisition, we funded $200 million of 15-year senior notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.69%.
