Despite the ongoing headwinds caused by COVID-19, the diversified nature of our business was evident during the quarter as we reported solid second quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings of $1 per diluted share.
Due to improving business conditions and our streamlined cost structure, we generated exceptionally strong cash flow during the quarter, enabling an incremental $86 million in net debt reduction to achieve debt leverage of just under 2.1 times.
For example, we trialed NexSys iON at a Carpet Mill that runs their fork trucks nearly 24/7, where there is very little time to recharge the batteries.
It is worth noting that we have already seen $50 million of 5G-related revenue lift during this year, which we believe is only the tip of the iceberg for this long-term growth driver.
As a result, we are projecting steady 6% plus CAGAR of Energy Systems sales over the next five years.
In the quarter for example, while Americas flooded lead acid battery sales were down 25% year-on-year; Americas Motive Power TPPL NexSys sales were up 25% in the same period.
We are pleased to say that the next generation initiatives growing transportation market share in the Specialty segment has been a resounding success over the past 12 months.
While still impacted by shutdowns from COVID, we grew our Transportation business by 64% this quarter with the integration of NorthStar and are currently limited only by TPPL capacity that will increase dramatically when the high speed line is fully operational.
Our second quarter net sales decreased 7% over the prior year to $708 million, due to an 11% decrease from volume, a 1% decrease in pricing, net of 1% increase from currency and a 4% increase from acquisitions.
On a line of business basis, our second quarter net sales in Motive Power were down 21% to $264 million and Energy System net sales were down 1% at $341 million, while Specialty increased 24% in the second quarter to $104 million.
Motive Power suffered a 21% decline in volume, due to the pandemic and a 1% decline in price, net of a 1% increase in FX.
Energy Systems had a 4% increase from the NorthStar acquisition and a 1% improvement from currency offset by decreases of 1% and 5% in pricing and volume respectively.
Specialty had 17% from the NorthStar acquisition less 9% in volume improvements and 1% increase from FX, net of a 3% decline in price and mix.
On a geographical basis, net sales for the Americas were down 8% year-over-year to $481 million with an 11% volume drop and a 1% price decline, net of a 4% increase from acquisitions, offset by 1% decrease from currency.
EMEA had a 6% -- was down 6% to $172 million on 13% volume and 2% price declines with 5% improvements in currency and 4% from acquisitions, while Asia was up 3% to $56 million, due primarily to currency.
On a line of business basis, specialty increased 17% with NorthStar starting to contribute its capacity for transportation sales, while Motive Power was flat and Energy Systems was down 4% on soft broadband revenues.
On a geographic basis, Americas were down 2%, EMEA was up 8%, while Asia was up 1%.
On a year-over-year basis, adjusted consolidated operating earnings in the second quarter decreased approximately $9 million to $66 million with the operating margin down 50 basis points.
However, on a sequential basis, our second quarter operating earnings improved 70 basis points to 9.35%.
Operating expenses when excluding highlighted items were at 15.7% of sales for the second quarter, compared to 16.1% in the prior year as we reduced our spending by $11 million year-over-year and nearly $3 million sequentially.
Excluded from operating expenses recorded on a GAAP basis in Q2, our pre-tax charges of $11 million, primarily related to $6 million in Alpha and NorthStar amortization and $3 million in restructuring charges.
Excluding those charges, our Motive Power business segment achieved an operating earnings percentage of 9.2%, which was 120 basis points lower than the 10.4% in the second quarter of last year, due to the 21% lower volume mentioned earlier in driving a $11 million drop in operating earnings.
On a sequential basis Motive Power's second quarter OE also dropped to 120 basis points from the 10.4% margin posted in the first quarter, due primarily to the reduction of $2.3 million in recovery on business interruption proceeds from the $3.8 million in Q1, down to $1.5 million.
We received $5 million in April, which was reflected in last fiscal year's fourth quarter results.
We received another $4 million in May, which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal '21 and we received over $1 million in July, which are reflected in Q2's results.
We expect to collect another $2 million on the matter, bringing the total recovered to nearly $13 million.
Overall, the claim including property loss and cleanup along with the business recovery, totaled approximately $45 million.
Energy Systems operating earnings percentage of 8.8% was up from last year's 8.6% and up from last quarter's 8%.
OE dollars decreased $0.5 million from the prior year primarily from lower operating expenses and increased $2 million from the prior quarter on lower commodity costs and operating expenses.
Specialty operating earnings percentage of 11.4% was down from last year's 12.3%, but up from last quarter's 6.5%.
OE dollars decreased nearly $2 million from the prior year on higher volume -- excuse me, they increased nearly $2 million from the prior year on higher volume and increased $6 million from the prior quarter on higher volume and lower manufacturing variances.
As previously reflected on Slide 11, our second quarter adjusted consolidated operating earnings of $66 million was a decrease in $9 million or 12% from the prior year.
Our adjusted consolidated net earnings of $43 million was nearly $10 million lower than the prior year.
The decline in adjusted net earnings reflect the decline in operating earnings, as well as a $4 million foreign currency loss, primarily on unfavorable exchange rates for intercompany balances.
Our adjusted effective income tax rate of 17% for the second quarter was lower than the prior year's rate of 18% and lower than the prior quarter's rate of 21%.
Fiscal 2019s full-year tax rate was 17%, while our fiscal 2020 tax rate was just below 18%, which is consistent with our expectations for fiscal 2021.
EPS decreased 19% to $1 on lower net earnings.
We expect our third fiscal quarter of 2021 to remain near the $43.1 million of weighted average shares outstanding in the second quarter.
As a reminder, we still have nearly $50 million of share buybacks authorized, but have no immediate plans to execute any repurchases with perhaps the exception of the modest annual repurchase made to offset employee stock dilution.
We have included our year-to-date results on Slides 13 and 14 for your information, but I do not intend to cover these in detail.
We now have nearly $414 million of cash on hand and our credit agreement leverage ratio is now 2.1 times, which allows over $600 million in additional borrowing capacity.
We expect our leverage to remain below 2.5 times in fiscal 2021.
We generated over $87 million in free cash flow in the second fiscal quarter of 2021.
Our first half free cash flow generation was very strong at $177 million.
Capital expenditures of $40 million were at our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year.
Our capex expectation for fiscal '21 of approximately $65 million to $70 million has expanded slightly as the economic outlook has improved.
It will cost in excess of $80 million with 75% being cash charges for severance, decommissioning, cleaning and closing open contracts with vendors, but it should payback in under four years and we can handle all expected demand from our other existing factories.
We anticipate our gross profit rate to remain near 25% in Q3 of fiscal '21, as the lower utilization in some of our factories over the July to September months will not hit our P&L until this third fiscal period, which we are now in.
As Dave mentioned, we still feel the core of our expectations remain intact beyond the nine to 12 month delay due to the pandemic in reaching our previously provided target for an additional $300 million in incremental adjusted net earnings.
With some of the uncertainty from our elections in the pandemic behind us, we currently feel we have enough visibility to provide a guidance range of $1.17 to $1.21 in our third fiscal quarter.
