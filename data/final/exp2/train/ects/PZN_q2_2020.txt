During the second quarter, the S&P 500 continued to rise on the growing dominance of the FANG stocks which now represent almost 13% of the index's market cap and 4.3% of the 500 companies earnings.
15 months ago our focus value strategy posted the best absolute 10 year performance record in its history.
While our most recent 10 year history is more representative of our long-term average.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500s most recent 10 year record is substantially above it's average and appears to be anomalously high.
When we calculate a sharp ratio using our recent performance record and our higher short-term volatility, our investment skill appears questionable versus the S&P 500.
However, when we do the same calculation using average 10 year returns and the volatility of those 10 year returns, we see a completely different picture which one actually represents our true investment skill after 25 years of deep value investing.
