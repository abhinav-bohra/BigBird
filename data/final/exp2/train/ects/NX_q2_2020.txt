We generated revenue of $187.5 million during the second quarter of 2020 compared to $218.2 million during the second quarter of 2019.
We've reported net income of $5.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the three months ended April 30, 2020 compared to a net loss of $24 million or $0.73 per diluted share during the three months ended April 30, 2019.
The net loss in the second quarter of 2019 was mainly due to a $30 million non-cash goodwill impairment in our North American Cabinet Components segment.
On an adjusted basis, net income was $6.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2020 compared to $6.3 million or $0.19 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2019.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter was $21.8 million compared to $23.4 million during the same period of last year.
Moving on to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 million for the six months ended April 30, 2020 compared to $143,000 for the six months ended April 30, 2019.
We now plan to spend between $20 million and $25 million this year and currently expect to generate $30 million to $35 million in free cash flow in the second half of the year.
As previously disclosed, we drew down our revolver by $50 million during the second quarter as a precautionary measure.
We have subsequently repaid the $50 million and do not expect to have to draw on our revolver again for the rest of the year.
Our balance sheet is strong, we have ample liquidity, and our leverage ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA remained unchanged at 1.4 times as of April 30, 2020.
We will continue to focus on generating cash and paying down debt in the second half of the year, which should offset the decrease in forecasted EBITDA enough to keep our leverage ratio around 1.4 times for the remainder of the year.
Revenue declined 5.9% from prior year Q2, but we were seeing revenue growth prior to the impact from the pandemic.
In fact, revenue was trending 3.1% above prior-year levels for the first five months of our fiscal year.
However, revenue in April declined by approximately 25% year-over-year due to the impact from COVID-19.
In addition, SG&A reductions, lower medical expenses and lower incentive accruals, all favorably impacted results, and we were able to realize a margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points in this segment during the quarter.
Revenue in our European Fenestration segment decreased by 27.2% from prior year to $29.2 million, excluding foreign exchange impact.
Similar to our North American Fenestration segment, revenue was trending 2.4% above prior year levels for the first five months of our fiscal year.
However, largely due to the fact that the UK was shut down completely, revenue in April was down approximately 85% year-over-year.
Our North American Cabinet Components segment generated revenue of $50.7 million during the quarter, which was 19.4% less than prior year.
Revenue in April decreased by approximately 37% year-over-year.
After adjusting for the lost customer, revenue was down 14.6% for the quarter and 34% in April.
EBITDA was also impacted by a $1.8 million accrual for writing off a portion of the inventory associated with Chinese-sourced product for the customer that exited the cabinet business.
These moves, combined with the normal seasonality of our business, should allow us to generate $30 million to $35 million of free cash flow for the full year, basically all of which will be generated in the second half.
We currently anticipate Q3 revenue will be down by 20% to 25% year-over-year in North America and adjusted EBITDA margin will be down 350 basis points to 400 basis points.
For the third quarter in Europe, we currently expect revenue to decrease by 40% to 45% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA margin contracting by 550 basis points to 600 basis points.
