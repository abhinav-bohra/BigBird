We're very pleased with the record results for the second quarter with sales of $250 million.
We've done a good job in our expense controls across the board, and combined with pricing disciplines from the merchandising teams and stores, we achieved solid gross margins and 11.7% pre-tax operating profits.
We're investing in our distribution capacity to support growth over $1 billion over our regions.
We just completed additional racking to our mothership, the Eastern Distribution Center in Braselton, Georgia, which adds 20% more storage capacity.
Also, container prices on the spot market continue to increase with prices varying between $12,000 and $22,000 a container.
We have been able to balance our shipping mix, so that no more than 20% to 30% is on the water at one-time at these increased rates.
Foam continues to be an issue for some of our domestic vendors, however, their production has increased during the second quarter, but still not at 100%.
They are expected to open back up beginning the week of 8/2.
Our pool is now approximately 2 times larger than last year, with the average pool age stretching to approximately eight weeks from six weeks over the last 90 days.
Our special order lead times have increased to 12 weeks to 20 weeks, depending on the vendor, causing some softening in our special order business.
Over 90% of our markets are delivering within a week to the customer's home once we have the product in our warehouses.
Staffing continues to be our #1 concern in both distribution and home delivery.
In the second quarter of 2021, delivered sales were $250 million, a 127.3% increase over the prior year quarter.

Comparable store sales were up 46.9% over the prior year period.
Our gross profit margin increased 240 basis points from 54.2% to 56.6% due to better merchandising, pricing and mix and less promotional activity during the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $39.8 million or 54.7% to $112.4 million, primarily due to increased sales activity.
However, as a percentage of sales, these costs declined over 2,000 basis points to 45% from 66.1%.
