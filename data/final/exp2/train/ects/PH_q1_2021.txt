It has 60% of our revenue comes from customers who buy from four or more of these technologies.
In addition to that, we continue to reduce recordable injuries and incidents by 31%.
Organic decline was 13% year-over-year, but that showed nice improvement versus the prior quarter, which was a 21% decline.
EBITDA margin was 19.5% as reported or 20.1% adjusted.
That makes two quarters in a row that we've been greater than 20% EBITDA margins we're excited about, and it was 100 basis point improvement versus the prior year.
We paid down debt in the quarter of $557 million.
And our cash flow from operations was just an outstanding level at 22.8%.
See, we came in at 19.9% for the quarter.
That was 110 basis point improvement versus the prior year.
On a legacy basis, so Parker without acquisitions, again on an adjusted basis, was a 14% decremental.
You can see we paid down $2 billion worth of debt in the last 11 months.
We've now paid off 37% of the LORD and Exotic transaction debt.
That was $210 million year-over-year incremental.
But if you go back and look at your Q4 notes, we were 90% discretionary, 10% permanent.
This quarter, Q1, we are now 30% permanent and moving to a full year of 60% permanent.
If you just go to that full year section of the page and looking at FY '21, see $175 million discretionary.
Permanent actions stayed the same at $250 million, and we're right on track to deliver that.
And you can see that the improvement now is even more pronounced, 1,100 basis points over this period of time.
And it's going to be all around Win Strategy 3.0, which we just recently changed in our purpose statement, which is in that blue box then at the bottom.
Slide 13, where I'm going to spend a little bit of time going through 3.0 to give you a little more context and color as to why we think our future performance is going to continue to accelerate.
Simplification is going to expand into more 80/20 and Simple by Design.
And of course, you're all familiar with 80/20.
The Simple by Design is the realization that 70% of your cost is tied up in how you design the product.
So we feel very excited to continuing the performance changes we've been making and the performance lift we're going to get with 3.0 that the transformation that you've seen is going to continue in the future.

Current year adjusted earnings per share of $3.07 compares to the $3.05 last year, an increase despite lower sales.
Adjustments from the fiscal 2021 as reported results netted to $0.60, including business realignment expenses of $0.12; integration costs to achieve of $0.03; and acquisition-related amortization of $0.63, offset by the tax effect of these adjustments of $0.18.
Prior year first quarter earnings per share were adjusted by a net $0.45, the details of which are included in the reconciliation tables for non-GAAP financial measures.
On slide 18, you'll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to $3.07 for the first quarter of this year.
Despite organic sales declining 13% and total sales dropping 3%, adjusted segment operating income increased the equivalent of $0.09 per share or $16 million.
In addition, we realized an $0.08 increase from lower corporate G&A as a result of salary reductions taken during the quarter and tight cost controls on discretionary spending.
Other income was $0.14 lower in the current year because the prior year included higher investment income and gains on several small real estate sales.
Organic sales decreased 13% year-over-year.
This decline was partially offset by favorable acquisition impact of 9.1% and currency impact of 0.8%.
Despite declining sales, total adjusted segment operating margin improved to 19.9% versus 18.8% last year.
This 110 basis point improvement reflects positive impacts from our Win Strategy initiatives and the hard work and dedication to cost containment and productivity improvements by our teams.
For the first quarter, North American organic sales were down 14.1%, and currency negatively impacted sales 0.3%.
These were partially offset by an 8.5% benefit from acquisitions.
Even with lower sales, operating margin for the first quarter on an adjusted basis was an impressive 21% of sales versus 19.4% last year.
Organic sales for the first quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 7.3%.
This was offset by contributions from acquisitions of 9.1% and currency of 2.9%.

And with a drop in net income of just $17 million, the free cash flow conversion from net income jumped to 216%.
This compares to a conversion rate of 118% last year.
Total orders decreased by 12% as of the quarter ending September.
This year-over-year decline is a consolidation of minus 11% within Diversified Industrial North America, minus 4% within Diversified Industrial International and minus 25% within Aerospace Systems orders.
Based on our current indicators, we have revised our outlook for total sales for the year to a year-over-year decline of 3.5% at the midpoint.
This includes an estimated organic decline of 7.3%, offset by increases from acquisitions of 2.8% and currency of 1%.
At the midpoint, total Parker adjusted margins are now forecasted to increase 30 basis points from prior year.
For guidance, we are estimating adjusted margins in a range of 19% to 19.4% for the full fiscal year.
For the below-the-line items, please note a significant difference between the as-reported estimate of $400 million versus the adjusted estimate of $500 million.
In October, as a subsequent event to the quarter, we reached a gain on the sale of real estate of $101 million pre-tax or $76 million after tax that will be recognized as other income.
The full year effective tax rate is projected to be 23%.
For the full year, the guidance range for earnings per share on an as-reported basis is now $9.93 to $10.53 or $10.23 at the midpoint.
On an adjusted earnings per share basis, the guidance range is now $11.70 to $12.30 or $12 even at the midpoint.
The adjustments to the as-reported forecast made in this guidance at a pre-tax level include business realignment expenses of approximately $60 million for the full year fiscal '21.
Savings from current year and prior year business realignment actions are projected to result in $210 million in incremental savings in fiscal year '21.
Also included in the adjustments to the as-reported forecasts are integration costs to achieve of $18 million.
Synergy savings for LORD are projected to be an additional $40 million, getting to a run rate of $80 million by the end of the year.
And for Exotic, we anticipate a run rate of $2 million savings by the end of the year.
Acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense is forecasted to be $322 million for the year.
Some additional key assumptions for full year 2021 guidance at the midpoint are sales are now divided 48% first half, 52% second half.
Adjusted segment operating income is split 46% first half and 54% second half.
Adjusted earnings per share first half, second half is divided 45%-55%.
Second quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share is projected to be $2.38 at the midpoint.
And this excludes $0.63 or $106 million of projected acquisition-related amortization expense, business realignment expenses and integration costs to achieve, offset in part by the gain on real estate of $0.59 or $101 million.
On slide 26, you'll find a reconciliation of the major components of the revised fiscal year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $12 even at the midpoint compared to the prior guidance of $10.30.
The teams outperformed our original estimates, beating the first quarter's guidance by $0.92.
With this performance and our continuing efforts to control costs, we are raising our estimated margins, which will in turn generate $0.81 of additional segment operating income over the next three quarters.
This calculates to an estimated decremental margin of 11.4% for the year.
Other minor adjustments to below operating income line items reduces our estimate by a net $0.03.
All in, this leaves $12 even adjusted earnings per share at the midpoint for our current guide for fiscal '21.
We continue to transform it with the three acquisitions, and we really feel strongly with the Win Strategy 3.0 in our purpose statement that our best days are ahead of us.
