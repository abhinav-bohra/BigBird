As we have discussed with you in the past, MISO completed a study outlining the potential road map of transmission projects through 2039.
Under MISOs Future one scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2039 and MISO estimates approximately $30 billion of future transmission investment would be necessary in the MISO footprint.
Under its Future three scenario, which resulted in an 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $100 million of transmission investment in the MISO footprint would be needed.
Beginning with environmental stewardship, last September, Ameren announced its transformation plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois.
This plan includes interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels in 2030 and 2040, respectively, and is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Our strong sustainable growth proposition is driven by a robust pipeline of investment opportunities over $40 billion over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders and making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner.
Our outlook through 2030 does not include significant infrastructure investments for electrification at this time.

Another key element of our sustainable growth proposition is the five-year earnings-per-share growth guidance we issued in February, which included a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings-per-share growth rate from 2021 to 2025.
Importantly, our five-year earnings and rate base growth projections do not include 1,200 megawatts of incremental renewable investment opportunities outlined in Ameren Missouris Integrated Resource Plan.

Turning to Ameren Missouri, our largest segment increased $0.27 per share, driven primarily by a change in seasonal electric rate design, resulting from the March 2020 rate order, which provided for lower winter rates in May and higher summer rates in September rather than the blended rates used in both months in 2020.
Higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately $0.10 per share largely due to continued economic recovery in this years third quarter compared to the unfavorable impacts of COVID-19 in the year ago period as well as higher electric retail sales driven by warmer-than-normal summer temperatures in the period compared to near-normal summer temperatures in the year-ago period.
Increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation eligible for plant and service accounting and the renewable energy standard rate adjustment mechanism, or RESRAM, positively impacted earnings by $0.07 per share.
The timing of tax expense, which is not expected to materially impact full year results increased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Higher operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020, which was affected by COVID-19 and remained flat year-to-date driven by disciplined cost management.
