Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $75.3 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, exceeding just the high end of our outlook.
Our Q3 maintenance and annual rate of 88% was above the low to mid-80% renewal rate we noted we expected in 2021.
In Q3, our subscription revenue grew at a 20% year-over-year rate with subscription ARR growing 23% year over year.
That execution led to another quarter of better-than-expected financial results for the third quarter with total revenue ending at $181.3 million, above the high end of our total revenue outlook of about $176 million to $180 million.
Total license and maintenance revenue was $149 million in the third quarter, which is a decrease of 6% from the prior year period.
The maintenance revenue was $120 million in the third quarter, which is up slightly from the prior year.
On a trailing 12-month basis, our maintenance renewal rate is 89%.
Also consistent with recent quarters, we want to provide the in-quarter renewal rate for the third quarter, which currently stands at approximately 88%, which again is above our expectations at the start of the year.
For the third quarter, license revenue was $29.2 million, which represents a decline of approximately 26% as compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Third quarter subscription revenue was $32.3 million, up the 20% year over year.
Total ARR have reached approximately $624 million as of September 30, 2021, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9% and is up slightly from our ending Q2 2021 ARR balance of $621 million, which is the corrected amount included in our 8-K filing from earlier this month.
Our subscription ARR of $130.2 million increased 23% year over year and 9% sequentially from the second quarter.
So we finished the third quarter of 2021 with 786 customers that have spent more than $100,000 with us in the last 12 months, which is a 4% improvement over the previous year.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $75.3 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, exceeding the high end of the outlook for the third quarter despite continuing to invest in our business.
Excluded from the adjusted EBITDA are onetime costs of approximately of the $2.9 million of cyber-related remediation, containment, investigation, and professional fees, net of insurance proceeds.

During the third quarter, we completed a two for one reverse stock split and declared a dividend of $1.50 per share on this post-split basis, which was paid in August.

As a result of this repayment, our cash balance is $709 million at the end of the third quarter, bringing our net debt to approximately $1.2 billion.
For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $180 million to $184 million, representing a year-over-year decline of negative 3% to negative 1%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $72 million to $74 million, which also implies an approximately 40% adjusted EBITDA margin.
Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share is projected to be $0.25 to $0.26 per share, assuming an estimated 160.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding, which reflects the reverse stock split completed on July 30.
And finally, our outlook for the fourth quarter assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%, and that we expect to pay approximately $8 million in cash taxes during the fourth quarter of 2021.
For the full year, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $712 million to $716 million, representing a year-over-year decline of negative 1% to flat with prior year.
