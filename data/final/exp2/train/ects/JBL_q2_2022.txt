In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for the year, while increasing core operating margin to 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year on year.
Given the higher revenue, I'm particularly pleased with our ability to drive an extra 30 basis points of margin improvement compared to our expectations in December mainly through broad-based strength in several key end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends as well as outstanding execution by our business, operations, and supply chain teams.
