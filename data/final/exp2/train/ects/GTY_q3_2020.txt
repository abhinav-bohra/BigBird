During the quarter, we invested $36.1 million for the acquisition of nine properties.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we invested an additional $36.6 million for the acquisition of eight properties.
The properties acquired are subject to a unitary triple-net lease with the 15 year based term and multiple renewal options.
Properties we acquired have an average lot size of 2 acres and an average tunnel length of more than 160 feet, both of which we believe, enhance the quality and diversity of our portfolio.
