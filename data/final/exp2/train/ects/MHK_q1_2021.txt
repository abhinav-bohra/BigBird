Interest expense of $15 million includes the full impact of the 2020 bond offerings.
Other income of $2 million, mainly the result of favorable transactional FX.

And finally, Flooring Rest of the World with sales of $770 million.
That's an increase of 31% as reported or 15% on a constant basis as our focus on the residential channel drove improvement across product -- all our product groups led by laminate, LVT and soft surface business in Australia and New Zealand.
The operating margin excluding charges of 20.9%, an increase of 740 basis points versus prior year, driven by the higher volume, favorable impact of price/mix and productivity, partially offset by the increase in inflation.
