We have transformed the company's portfolio, delivered revenue and adjusted company FFO above consensus, produced strong underlying portfolio performance and increased the dividend by 11.6%.
With 95% of our gross assets now industrial, we have substantially completed our portfolio transformation to a predominantly single-tenant industrial REIT.
With 2.6 million square feet of space leased in the quarter, we raised our stabilized lease portfolio 110 basis points to 98.9% and increased base and cash base industrial rents on extensions and new leases 6.5% and 4.7%, respectively.
Further, for the nine months ended September 30, we raised base and cash-based industrial rents on extensions and new leases 10.3% and 7%, respectively.
Average rent per square foot in our warehouse distribution portfolio is $3.97, which we view as 6% to 8% below market, as market rents continue to grow considerably faster than the escalations built into our leases.
And we note that rents in our target markets have grown on average approximately 8% over the last year.
We secured a 5.5-year lease with a new tenant who will occupy the 195,000 square foot vacant property that we recently purchased in the Greenville-Spartanburg market as part of a four-property industrial portfolio acquisition.
The lease term includes 2.75% annual rental escalations, and the lease produces an initial stabilized yield of 5.3% for the property.
Additionally, we leased 68,000 square feet of available space to a new tenant at our Lakeland, Florida warehouse distribution facility for five years, increasing the building's occupancy from 53% to 84%.
The starting rent is $5.70 per square foot with 3% annual escalations.
Other significant leasing outcomes during the quarter that resulted in an increase to cash base rent over the prior lease term included a five-year lease with 3% annual escalations at our 640,000 square foot Statesville, North Carolina warehouse distribution facility and a three-year lease with 2.25% annual escalations at our 1.2 million square foot Olive Branch, Mississippi warehouse distribution facility.
Subsequent to quarter end, we had a huge success at our 908,000 square foot spec development facility in Fairburn, Georgia, executing a seven-year lease with 3% annual escalations and bringing the stabilized yield to 7.2%, excluding our partner promote, which was well above our underwriting assumptions.
We currently have four spec development projects in process, two of which we added during the third quarter, with an estimated total project cost of $358 million and $270 million left to fund.
On the purchase front, we acquired $135 million of Class A warehouse distribution product during the quarter, with an additional $76 million purchased subsequently, and we currently have a sizable pipeline under review.
Our sales volume as of September 30 totaled $219 million at average GAAP and cash cap rates of 7.6% and 7.9%, respectively.
We sold an additional $25 million after quarter-end and have two other properties under contract to sell for $29 million.
The new declared quarterly common share dividend, which will be paid in the first quarter of 2022, will be $0.12 per share, representing an 11.6% increase over the prior quarterly dividend.
During the third quarter, we purchased five warehouse distribution assets spanning 1.3 million square feet for $135 million at average GAAP and cash stabilized cap rate of 4.9% and 4.6%, respectively.
We also acquired a 293,000 square foot stabilized warehouse distribution facility in Columbus, Ohio, a primary distribution market in the central U.S.
This facility is a recent build occupied by two tenants with a weighted average lease term of seven years and average annual rental escalations of 2.5%.
Subsequent to quarter-close, we purchased a three-property, 878,000 square foot portfolio in the Whiteland submarket of Indianapolis.
The three properties, all recently constructed, sit along I-65 in the Whiteland Exchange Business Park.
Upon completion, which will be staggered in the first half of 2022, the three buildings will total roughly 1.9 million square feet.
The estimated development cost of this project is approximately $133 million, with estimated stabilized cash yields projected to be in the low to mid-5% range.
The Phoenix project is a 57-acre site in the Goodyear submarket along the Southwest Valley Loop 303 industrial hub.
Upon completion, the project will consist of two Class A warehouse distribution facilities totaling 880,000 square feet.
The site is in PV 303, the sub-market's premier master-planned business park that is highly desirable for corporate users.
The estimated development cost is approximately $84 million, with estimated stabilized cash yield forecasted to be in the high 4% range.
Currently, we have 2.4 million square feet of modern Class A industrial space in Phoenix; and, more specifically, two million square feet in Goodyear, and we'll further increase our footprint there with the completion of this development project.
During the third quarter, we produced adjusted company FFO of roughly $54 million, or $0.19 per diluted common share.
Today, we announced an increase to both the low and top end of our adjusted company FFO guidance range to a new range of $0.75 to $0.78 per diluted common share.
Revenues for the quarter were approximately $83 million, with property operating expenses of just over $11 million, of which 84% was attributable to tenant reimbursement.
G&A for the quarter was $8.4 million, and we expect 2021 G&A to be within a range of $33 million to $36 million.
Our same-store portfolio was 98.7% leased at quarter end, with overall same-store NOI increasing 0.7%, which would have been approximately 1.9%, excluding single-tenant vacancy.
Industrial same-store NOI increased 1.2% and would have been 2.5%, excluding single-tenant vacancy.
At quarter-end, approximately 90% of our industrial portfolio leases had escalation, with an average rate of 2.6%.
Our company's balance sheet remains solid, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.4 times at quarter-end and unencumbered NOI at 91.5%.
During the quarter, we issued $400 million of senior notes due in 2031 with an attractive rate of 2.375%.
The net proceeds and cash on hand were used to fully redeem our 4.25 senior notes due in 2023 and repay the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility.
Consolidated debt outstanding as of September 30 was approximately $1.5 billion with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 2.9% and a weighted average term of about eight years.
Finally, during the quarter, we settled 3.9 million common shares previously sold on a forward basis, leaving $240 million, or 20.8 million common shares, of unsettled common share contracts available at quarter-end.
