Revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down 7% to 12% versus prior year.

Commercial revenue is expected to be down between 35% and 40%, in line with the broader commercial aerospace market.
Pricing is expected to be a benefit of 1% in the quarter, but in line with 2020 for the full year.
In addition to the revenue guidance that Scott provided, we're expecting incremental margins of 30% to 35% in industrial and decremental margins of 30% to 35% in aerospace and defense.
We're also planning for corporate cost of $8.5 million, higher than our expected full-year run rate, due to the timing of certain expenses, such as RFPs.
Interest expense is expected to be roughly $8.5 million in Q1.
We are expecting organic revenue growth of 0% to 4%, and with aerospace and defense expected to grow at low to mid-single digits and industrial at low single digits.
We're expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2 to $2.20, a 40% to 54% increase versus 2020.
Finally, we're planning to deliver free cash flow as a percent of adjusted net income of 85% to 95%.
