Currently, over 98% of our third quarter rental and related charges have been collected.
Demand throughout our communities remain strong as evidenced by our 320 basis point improvement in same community occupancy and our 54% sales growth as compared to the same quarter last year.
We further demonstrated the success of our business plan by obtaining $106 million of GSE financing at 2.62%.
This loan pioneered GSE acceptance of up to 60% rental homes in communities.
Subsequent to quarter end, this capital was used to redeem our 8% Series B preferred stock.
This 500 basis point improvement will result in over $5 million in additional FFO per year or approximately $0.12 per share.
Normalized FFO for the third quarter was $0.18 per diluted share compared to $0.15 in the prior year period.
This represents an increase of 20%.
We are pleased that our $0.18 dividend per quarter is now fully covered by our current operating performance.

Year-to-date, total income is up 11%.

The combination of income growth and expense ratio reduction resulted in overall NOI growth of 17% for the quarter and 19% for the year.
Our same-property occupancy rate improved 320 basis points to 86.9% from the same quarter last year.
This translates to an increase of 706 revenue-producing sites year-over-year.

These are value-add communities with an in-place occupancy rate of 64%.
These communities contain approximately 580 sites, of which 64% are occupied.
The total purchase price for these communities is $21 million or $36,000 per site.
We have covered our $0.18 dividend prior to the positive impact that the redemption and refinance of our Series B preferred will have on earnings.

As we had previously announced, we redeemed all 3.8 million issued and outstanding shares of our 8% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock totaling $95 million on October 20.
