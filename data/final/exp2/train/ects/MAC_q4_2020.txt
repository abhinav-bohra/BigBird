1 Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark Ranking in the North American retail sector.
Funds from operations for the fourth quarter was $0.45.
That's down from the fourth quarter of 2019 at $0.98 per share.
Same-center net operating income for the quarter was down 33%, and year to date is down 22%.
One, $38 million decline from COVID-related rent abatements across permanent and temporary leasing revenue line items.
Fourth-quarter abatements were elevated relative to the third-quarter abatements of $28 million, and this was largely due to the protracted summer closures of several large properties in New York and in California.
Cumulatively for the year, in 2020, we granted $56 million of abatements.
Number two, $19 million of COVID-related decline in common area and ancillary revenues, including specialty leasing and temporary tenant revenue, percentage rent revenue, business development revenue, and parking revenue.
In total, for all of 2020, these line items were down $43 million.
Number three, general top-line revenue decrease is totaling approximately $12 million, driven primarily by COVID-related occupancy decreases.
Number four, $6 million of bad debt expense in the form of reversals of lease revenue for tenants on a cash basis pursuant to GAAP, that was about $5 million, and then bad debt expenses of about $1 million.
As a result of the COVID-related disruption to our business, the bad debt expense line item was significantly elevated in 2020 at $62 million.
This was a $52 million increase versus $10 million of bad debt expense in 2019.
Number five, there was an $8 million decrease from loss or gain on un-depreciated asset sales or writedowns on consolidated assets.
This included a $5 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2020 for undeveloped land that is currently under contract for sale and is expected to close in 2021.
And lastly, offsetting these items, straight-line rent increased $19 million in the fourth quarter.
So to summarize some of the major impacts of COVID that impacted real estate NOI in 2020, and again, all these figures are at the company's share, we highlight the following: number one, $56 million of one-time retroactive abatements of rent.
Number two, a $43 million of decline in common area and ancillary revenues, percentage rent and temporary -- or excuse me, and parking revenues.
And number three, we wrote-off an extra $52 million of bad debt expense relative to 2019.
Plus, in addition, we had another $11 million of rent that was reversed for tenants that are accounted for on a cash basis.
So when you add all that up, collectively, it's roughly $162 million of pandemic-driven NOI decline just among those three categories.
