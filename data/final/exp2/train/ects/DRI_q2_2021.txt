Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%, same-restaurant sales decreased 20.6% and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74.
The last two weeks of the quarter negatively impacted our same-restaurant sales by approximately 200 basis points as we quickly went from 97% of our dining rooms being opened in the middle of the quarter to only 80% being open at the end of the quarter.
Our teams have been operating in this environment for 10 months, and they have become very adept at adjusting to the ever-changing COVID restrictions, but it's still not easy.
Our brands benefit from the technology platform Darden provides, allowing each of them to compete more effectively by harnessing the power of our digital tools, including the 25 million email addresses in our marketing database.
More than 55% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guest ordered and paid online.
And at Olive Garden, 20% of our total sales for the quarter were digital.
Olive Garden same-restaurant sales declined 19.9% as capacity restrictions continue to limit their top-line sales.
Olive Garden began November with 56 dining rooms closed, and that number accelerated to 208 by the end of the month.
However, they were able to deliver strong average weekly sales during the quarter of more than 73,000 per restaurant, retaining 80% of last year's sales.
Additionally, off-premise sales grew 83% in the quarter, representing 39% of total sales.
Same-restaurant sales declined 11.1%.
Almost 20% of their restaurants grew same-restaurant sales in the quarter.
Finally, LongHorn grew off-premise sales by more than 175%, representing 22% of total sales.
For the second quarter, total sales were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%.
Same-restaurant sales declined 20.6%, EBITDA was $206 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74.
We estimate that this downward shift in sales over the last two weeks negatively impacted operating income by approximately $15 million.
Food and beverage expense was 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by investments in food quality and increased to-go packaging.
Restaurant labor was 140 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor improving by over 310 basis points, driven by operational simplification.
This was partially offset by deleverage and management labor due to sales declines and $3 million of emergency pay net of retention credits as we reinstated our emergency pay program for our team members impacted by dining room closures.
Restaurant expense per operating week was 13% lower than last year, driven by lower repairs, maintenance and utilities expenses.
However, sales deleverage resulted in restaurant expense as a percent of sales coming in 170 basis points higher than last year.
We reduced marketing spend by almost $50 million this quarter with total marketing 210 basis points favorable to last year.
Restaurant level EBITDA margin was 17.9%, 140 basis points above last year despite the sales decline of 19%.
General and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by $8 million of mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation.
Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $6.4 million, resulting in a net mark-to-market reduction to earnings after-tax this quarter of $1.7 million.
The effective tax rate of 8.3% this quarter was lower by 5.1 percentage points due to the tax benefits from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned.
After adjusting for this, the normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter would have been 13.4%.
Our Fine Dining segment profit margin of 18.8% was impressive, although below last year, driven by a 30% sales decline.
We ended the second quarter with $770 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.5 billion of available liquidity.
We generated over $150 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 58% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of 75%.
The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share, 50% of our Q2 diluted earnings per share within our long-term framework for value creation.
As of today, we have approximately 77% of our restaurants operating with at least partial dining room capacity versus a peak of 97% in the middle of the second quarter.
We expect total sales to be between 65% and 70% of prior year levels, resulting in total sales of between $1.53 billion and $1.65 billion, EBITDA between $170 million and $210 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $0.50 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares.
And consistent with our messaging last quarter, we continue to believe we can achieve 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID EBITDA -- pre-COVID sales, while continuing to make appropriate investments in our business.
