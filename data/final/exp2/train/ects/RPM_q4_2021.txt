Operating cash flow climbed nearly 40% to a record $766.2 million, and our adjusted EBIT margin climbed to 12.8%, which was also a record.
This team launched our MS-168 manufacturing system, which is allowing us to produce better products more quickly, more cost-effectively, and more sustainably.
In addition, we reduced our global manufacturing footprint by 28 facilities, consolidating production to more strategically advantageous plants.

Similar initiatives were undertaken in our IT infrastructure as we have migrated 75% of our organization to one to four group-level ERP platforms.
Over the course of the three-year MAP to Growth program, we have returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases.
While we have reached the 2020 MAP to Growth conclusion, there will be some runoff from the MAP to Growth program in fiscal '22, during which we expect to capture approximately $50 million in incremental savings.
Over the next six to 12 months, we will be working on a MAP 2.0 program in conjunction with our operating leaders.
We remain fully committed to achieving our long-term goal of a 16% EBIT margin, and we will be sharing more information about our progress for a new program in the coming quarters.

If you exclude the impact of our nonoperating segment from both years, our four operating segments combined generated impressive sales growth of 19.6% and adjusted EBIT growth of 27.5% as they overcame margin pressures and supply availability challenges.

We expect consolidated sales to increase in the low to mid-single digits compared to Q1 of fiscal 2021 when sales grew 9%, creating a difficult year-over-year comparison.
Sales in our consumer group are expected to decline double digits as it continues to experience difficult comparisons to the prior year when organic growth was up 34%.
Based on the anticipated decline in this one segment, our Q1 consolidated adjusted EBIT is expected to decrease 25% to 30% versus a difficult prior-year comparison when adjusted EBIT in last year's first quarter was up nearly 40%.
As discussed earlier, the challenges in this segment are anticipated to result in a significant decline in adjusted EBIT against difficult prior-year comparisons when sales were up 21% and adjusted EBIT was up 66%.
We anticipate that the Q2 decline in consumers will be mostly offset by the combined EBIT growth in our three other segments, leading to consolidated adjusted EBIT being roughly flat versus another difficult prior-year comparison when consolidated adjusted EBIT was up nearly 30%.
