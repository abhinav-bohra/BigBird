Sales of fuel containers in our consumer end market were up nearly 40% primarily as a result of increased storm activity.
Sales in our vehicle end market were down double-digits as higher sales to RV customers were more than offset by lower sales to automotive OEMs. Material Handlings adjusted operating income was up 59% to $16.5 million due to higher sales volume, lower depreciation and amortization expense and favorable price cost margin.
Also in 2019 adjusted operating income included a $3.5 million charge for estimated product replacement costs.

Cash on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter was $84 million and our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times, which is consistent with previous quarters.
We continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $21 million.
Net interest expense to be approximately $4 million.
A diluted share count of approximately $36 million shares.
And capital expenditures to be roughly $15 million.
Lastly, we anticipate that the adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 26%.
The experience we gained from completing the bolt-ons and Horizon 1, will prepare us to successfully execute larger acquisitions under Horizon two.
I can see a path to grow Myers to approximately $2 billion in revenue while largely staying in the United States.
