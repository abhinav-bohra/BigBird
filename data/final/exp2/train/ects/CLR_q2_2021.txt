This significant free cash flow is being dedicated to shareholder capital returns in the form of an increased quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, continued focus on debt reduction and resumption of our $1 billion share repurchase program.
During the second quarter, we generated a company record-breaking $634 million of free cash flow, reducing net debt by $284 million ending the quarter with $4.59 billion.
Year-to-date, we've generated $1.34 billion in free cash flow, while reducing our net debt by $892 million.
We distributed $40 million to shareholders with our previous $0.11 quarterly dividend.
We exceeded our production guidance for the quarter, delivering 167,000 BOE a day and just over -- barrels of oil a day and just over 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day.
On gas, we have about approximately 50% of our volume hedged through year-end with a combination of swaps and collars that provide a flow around three powertrain retaining price upsize of over $5.
We're announcing the potential to generate approximately $2.4 billion of free cash flow at current strip prices this year, which equates to an approximately 19% free cash flow yield.
Given our discipline response to rising commodity prices, our capex budget for 2021 has not changed and our reinvestment rate is trending toward 35%.
With regard to strengthening the balance sheet, our net debt reduction is tracking toward $1.8 billion in 2021, which will bring our year-end net debt close to $3.7 billion.
Our intention is to reduce absolute debt to one-time at $50 to $55 WTI, which equates to approximately $3 billion in debt.
We're generating strong corporate returns and projecting to deliver 18% return on capital employed in 2021.
That is why we increased our quarterly fixed dividend by 36% versus last quarter to $0.15 a share.
This has tripled our original dividend rate and equals to an approximately 1.7% annualized dividend yield, which we believe is competitive with industry peers and shows ongoing growth in cash returns.
We are resuming our share repurchase program of $1 billion, which began in 2019 with $317 million of purchases previously executed $683 million of capacity remains.
The combined shareholder capital returns in the form of the annualized dividend and projected net debt reduction by year-end 2021 alone would equate to 53% of the company's projected full year 2021 cash flow from operations, and 16% of the current -- company's current capital market.
Natural gas production in 2021 is now expected to range between 900,000,001 BCF a day.
Production expense is projected to be $3 to $3.50 per BOE better than the original guidance of $3.25 to $3.75.
First, our assets are performing with remarkable consistency and predictability, delivering their terms in excess of 100% from our Bakken and 60% to 80% from our Oklahoma drilling programs, assuming $60 WTI and $3 NYMEX gas.
Second, we are on track to reduce our weighted average cost per well year-over-year by approximately 10%, and 70% to 80% of these savings are structural.
Third, our capital efficiencies are reaching record levels and we expect to deliver a projected return on capital employed of approximately 18% for 2021.
For example, the decision to focus up to 70% of our rigs on our Oklahoma natural gas assets in the second quarter of last year has proven to be very strategic.
Our second quarter 2021 natural gas production in Oklahoma was up approximately 10% over the first quarter of 2020, while NYMEX natural gas prices, more than doubled over this same period of time.
With today's improved crude prices, we are exercising this optionality once again in migrating up to 75% of our rigs to a more oil weighted portfolio in the back half of this year.
During the quarter, we brought on 108 gross operated wells with 70 in the Bakken and 38 in Oklahoma.
This chart compares the average performance of our 2021 wells with average performance of 488 Continental operated wells completed over the prior four years, grouped by program year.
Over the last four years, we have also reduced our cycle time for putting Bakken wells online by 50% and dropped our completed well costs by approximately 30% driving our capital efficiencies in the Bakken to record levels.
Today, we are producing approximately 45% more BOE per $1,000 spent in the first 12 months than we did in 2018.
Our Bakken differentials are also improving, driven by demand for Bakken crude and the expansion of DAPL, which was put into operation on August 1.
With this expansion, there is approximately 1.6 million barrels of pipeline and local refining takeaway capacity from the Bakken excluding rail.
Before leaving the Bakken, I should point out that 11 of our second quarter Bakken completions were located in our Long Creek unit.
These 11 wells are excellent producers as shown on Slide 9, equally impressive by the well costs that are coming in below original estimates at approximately 6.1 million per well.
Recent results are bellwether for things to come, as we continue developing a total of 56 wells in this unit, and we expect to complete about 30% of these wells by year-end 2021, 50% in 2020 and the remaining 20% in early 2023.
These charts show the average well performance by year in all four of our SpringBoard project areas over the last 2.5 years.
This includes 155 operating wells of which 70% were oil well and 30% were condensate wells.
The chart includes seven Woodford and four Sycamore wells that we completed over the last 2.5 years.
Even more impressive is that we're on track to reduce our completed well cost by approximately 17% year-over-year.
Since 2018, our teams have reduced completed well costs in Oklahoma by a total of 40%, which as in the Bakken has driven our capital efficiencies to record levels in Oklahoma.
As shown on Slide 11, we are producing approximately 80% more BOE per $1,000 spent in the first 12 months than we did in 2018.
In the fourth quarter, we are projecting a December exit rate of approximately 165,000 barrels of oil per day.
