The gross margin gap was approximately $15 million with the labor challenges making up more than one-third of the gap.
We experienced another sequential increase in raw material inflation, resulting in scrap steel and brass ingot prices up over 50% versus the prior year.
In the fourth quarter, the operational challenges were even greater for our specialty valve product portfolio, which accounts for approximately 15% of annual sales.
