Yesterday, we posted our financial results for the first nine months of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion.
Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of September was 0.17 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, which is a new company record and substantially better than industry benchmarks.
We are forecasting approximately 90 million planted corn acres in the United States in 2021.
This is in line with the levels of the last 10 years and supported by improved farm economics due to higher corn futures, government payments and lower input prices.
Our year-to-date DEF sales volumes are up 6% compared to 2019, which would have been difficult to foresee in April when economic activity and miles driven declined so dramatically.
We also expect demand for urea imports into Brazil of approximately 6.5 million metric tons will continue to be supported by improved farm incomes and no active domestic urea production.
For the first nine months of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $230 million or $1.07 per diluted share.
EBITDA was $982 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion.
For the third quarter of 2020, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $28 million or $0.13 per diluted share.
EBITDA was $196 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $204 million.
On a trailing 12-month basis, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $756 million.
At the end of October, cash on the balance sheet was well over $600 million, and we are well positioned to fulfill our commitment to repay the remaining $250 million on our 2021 notes.
We expect capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $350 million as we maintain our high standards of reliability and safety.
We expect our capital budget will return to our typical $400 million to $450 million range in 2021 and beyond.
That said, we expect that additional steps we will take to enable the production of green and low-carbon ammonia will require investment beyond this $400 million to $450 million annual range.
So after the repayment of the $250 million in 2021 notes, we would expect that our primary use of cash in the coming years will be in support of our strategic focus on clean hydrogen and ammonia projects.
