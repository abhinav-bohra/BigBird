Our revenue and earnings for the quarter were solid, and we are on track to deliver annual revenue growth of over 10% and year-over-year earnings growth at an even higher rate.
iQIYI recently announced they will be making Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos content available on their international app that is available in over 190 countries and will be enabling Dolby experiences in new original local content on their platform.
We now have about 95% of our Dolby Cinemas open globally, and our partners remain deeply engaged.
Revenue in the third quarter was $287 million, which was at the higher end of our guidance range and included a true-up of about $14 million for Q2 shipments reported that were above the original estimates, and that item is not uncommon.
On a year-over-year basis, third quarter revenue was about $40 million above last year's Q3 as we benefited from higher market TAMs, along with greater adoption of our Dolby technologies.
So Q3 revenue was comprised of $272 million in licensing and $15 million in products and services.
Broadcast represented about 46% of total licensing in the third quarter.
Broadcast revenues increased by about 40% year-over-year, and that was driven by higher market volume, higher recoveries and higher adoption of our Dolby technologies.
And then on a sequential basis, broadcast increased by about 18%, and that was due mostly to higher recoveries.
In the mobile space, mobile represented about 18% of total licensing in Q3.
Mobile declined by about 36% year-over-year, mainly due to lower recoveries, and that was offset partially by higher market volume.
And then on a sequential basis, mobile was down by about 24%, due mostly to timing of revenue under contracts, and we did anticipate that.
Consumer electronics represented about 14% of total licensing in Q3.
And on a year-over-year basis, CE licensing increased by about 86%, driven by higher market volume, higher adoption of Dolby and higher recoveries.
On a sequential basis, CE went down by about 22%, and that was due mainly to timing of revenue under contracts.
PC represented about 9% of total licensing in the third quarter.
PC was higher than last year by about 6%, due to higher market volume, along with increased adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, offset partially by lower recoveries.
And sequentially, PC was down by about 51%, due mostly to timing of revenue, and that lines up with some of the comments I made last quarter about its increase that quarter because of timing.
Other markets represented about 13% of total licensing in the third quarter.
They were up about 42% year-over-year, and that was driven by higher revenue from Dolby Cinema, via admin fees and gaming.
And on a sequential basis, other markets increased by about 4% due mostly to Dolby Cinema and to gaming.
So if I go beyond licensing, our products and services revenue was about $15.2 million in Q3 compared to $16 million in Q2 and $11.8 million in last year of Q3.
Total gross margin in the third quarter was 89% on a GAAP basis and 89.7% on a non-GAAP basis.
Products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $3.9 million in Q3 compared to minus $345,000 in the second quarter, and products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $2.6 million in Q3 compared to a positive $1.1 million in the second quarter.
Operating expenses in the third quarter on a GAAP basis were $199.1 million compared to $204 million in Q2, and our operating expenses in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $173.6 million compared to $178.4 million in the second quarter.
And then our operating income in the third quarter was $56.1 million on a GAAP basis or 19.6% of revenue compared to $34.1 million or 13.8% of revenue in Q3 of last year.
Operating income in the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $83.6 million or 29.1% of revenue compared to $60.5 million or 24.5% of revenue in Q3 of last year.
Income tax in Q3 was 7.7% on a GAAP basis and 13.7% on a non-GAAP basis.
Net income on a GAAP basis in the third quarter was $54.6 million or $0.52 per diluted share compared to $67.3 million or $0.66 per diluted share in last year's Q3.
Now I'd like to point out as a reminder, last year's Q3 net income, and that's both GAAP and non-GAAP, included $36 million of discrete tax benefits, which does affect the year-over-year comparisons.
So our net income on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter was $74.8 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $87.5 million or $0.86 per diluted share in Q3 of last year.
During the third quarter, we generated $172 million in cash from operations compared to $134 million generated in last year's third quarter.
We ended the third quarter with about $1.3 billion in cash and investments.
During the third quarter, we bought back about 400,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $37 million of stock repurchase authorization available.
Today, we announced that the Board of Directors has approved an additional $350 million of stock repurchase authorization.
So if I combine that new approval with the remaining balance that was at the end of June, means that as of today, we have $387 million of stock repurchase authorization available going forward.
We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share.
The dividend will be payable on August 19, 2021, to shareholders of record on August 11, 2021.
Last quarter, when I discussed guidance for Q3, I laid out a scenario that said our second half revenue could range from $560 million to $600 million.
Now with Q3 under our belt and having landed in the range, we are updating the second half revenue range to $570 million to $600 million, in other words, bumping up the lower end by $10 million, which means we are anticipating Q4 revenue to range from $280 million to $310 million.
Within that, licensing could range from $265 million to $290 million, while products and services could range from $15 million to $20 million.
Q4 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 88% to 89%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 89% to 90%.
Within that, products and services gross margin is estimated to range from about breakeven to $1 million on a GAAP basis and from about $1 million to $2 million on a non-GAAP basis.
Operating expenses in Q4 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $216 million to $226 million, and operating expenses in Q4 on a non-GAAP basis are estimated to range from $190 million to $200 million.
Other income is projected to range from $1 million to $2 million for the fourth quarter, and our effective tax rate for Q4 is projected to range from 19% to 20% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
Based on a combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q4 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.25 to $0.40 on a GAAP basis and from $0.47 to $0.62 on a non-GAAP basis.
FY '21 revenue is anticipated to range from $1.28 billion to $1.31 billion, with gross margin ranging from 89% to 90% on a GAAP basis and 90% to 91% on a non-GAAP basis.
Total operating expenses for the year are estimated to range from $810 million to $820 million on a GAAP basis and from $710 million to $720 million on a non-GAAP basis.
And full year diluted earnings per share are estimated to range from $2.79 to $2.94 on a GAAP basis and from $3.57 to $3.72 on a non-GAAP basis.
Q4 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 88% to 89%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 89% to 90%.
