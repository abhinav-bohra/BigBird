The $0.06 difference includes restructuring costs of $0.03 and acquisition costs of $0.03.
As shown in the chart, the increase of $0.95 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 consists of the following: $1.15 due to higher revenue, $0.08 due to higher gross margin percentage and $0.05 due to lower interest expense.
These increases were partially offset by $0.27 due to higher operating expenses, $0.04 due to a decrease in the amounts received from government assistance programs and $0.02 due to higher weighted average shares outstanding.
Collectively, included in all the categories I just mentioned, was a favorable foreign currency translation effect of $0.16 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of last year due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar.

We paid down $27 million of our debt in the quarter.
And as previously mentioned, we also borrowed $79 million of debt at the end of the second quarter to fund our acquisition of Clouth, which was largely completed in mid-July.
We borrowed an additional $4 million at the end of July associated with the acquisition of the remaining legal entity, which we expect will be completed in mid-August.

Our net interest expense decreased $0.9 million or 47% to $1 million in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2020.
At the end of the second quarter of 2021, we had $141 million of borrowing capacity available on our revolving credit facility which matures in December of 2023.
As a result, we are updating our revenue range for the year to an increase over 2020 of approximately 23% to 25% and or $783 million to $793 million, up from our previous estimated range of $710 million to $730 million.
The majority of this increase is organic with approximately 1/3 of the revenue range increase related to the addition of Clouth.
For the third quarter, we anticipate revenue between $195 million to $200 million and for the fourth quarter revenue of $220 million to $225 million.
We now anticipate gross margins for the year will come in at approximately 42.5%, down from our prior estimate of 43%, principally, as a result of including the amortization of the acquired profit and inventory related to our Clouth acquisition.
As a result, we anticipate gross margins will be 42% in the second half of the year, which includes the impact of amortization of the acquired profit and inventory.
Our current estimate for the inventory write-up is approximately $3.5 million with $1.4 million or $0.09 turning in the third quarter and the remaining $2.1 million or $0.12 turning in the fourth quarter.
We anticipate SG&A expenses will be a little over $54 million per quarter in the third and fourth quarter.
We now anticipate that SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue will be lower than we projected at the beginning of the year and will be approximately 26% of revenue for the full year 2021.
This includes backlog amortization expense of approximately $400,000 or $0.03 in the third quarter.
Our interest expense will be approximately $1.3 million per quarter in the second half of 2021 due to the incremental borrowings related to our recent acquisition.
We anticipate the tax rate for the year will be approximately 28% and the third and fourth quarter of '21, approximately 28.5% to 29%.
We anticipate that our adjusted earnings per share will be lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to several factors, including a lower anticipated gross margin percentage versus the second quarter and the lack of payments received from government programs that contributed $0.10 to the second quarter results.
We have recast our first quarter 2021 non-GAAP financial metrics to reflect that our SG&A expense included $1.3 million of acquisition costs related to our acquisition of Clouth, which was announced in June.
We reported diluted earnings per share of $1.43 in the first quarter of 2021.
With these acquisition costs added back, our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.53 in the first quarter of 2021.
Also, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $31.1 million or 18% of revenue in the first quarter of 2021.
With the addition of these acquisition costs, our adjusted EBITDA was $32.4 million or 18.8% of revenue.
