The AMES strategic initiative remains on schedule for completion by the end of 2023 and we reiterate our expectation to realize annual cash savings of $30 million to $35 million, and inventory reductions of the same magnitude when the benefits of the initiative are fully realized.

As a result of our substantial outperformance in the first half of the year and with consideration to this year's Q3 and Q4 comparatives to strong prior year quarter results, we are expecting our fiscal 2021 performance will be substantially above our original guidance and in line with our trailing-12 months.
That produced approximately $2.5 billion of revenue and $320 million of adjusted EBITDA, excluding unallocated and one-time charges.
