The 24% growth I cited is an increase from 15% in the first quarter relative to the same period in 2019.
These decisions supported new account growth of 26% over 2019 levels with strong growth among prime consumers as our differentiated brand and integrated networks support our strong value proposition, which centers on transparent and useful rewards, outstanding customer service and no annual fees.
