Revenues grew more than 38% year over year and were up nearly 6% from the fourth quarter of 2019.
Every segment of our business contributed to this exceptional performance with 24 of our 27 open properties growing revenues at a double-digit rate during the quarter.

Earlier today, we announced that our board has approved a $0.15 per share dividend starting this April.
This dividend is in addition to the $300 million share repurchase program our board approved in October.
To date, we have bought back $150 million in stock since we resumed our share repurchase program.
We finished the year with EBITDAR approaching $1.4 billion, more than 50% higher than the previous record set in 2019.
With EBITDA increasing since the end of 2019 by approximately $500 million and debt balances reduced during that same period of time by approximately $850 million, our leverage has been reduced by half from pre-COVID levels.
Our current leverage is approximately 2.4 times, and lease-adjusted leverage is 2.8 times.
As of the end of 2021, our NOL balance was $7 million.
Our expected tax rate is 23.5%.
We expect our 2022 capital program to be approximately $250 million, which includes amounts for hotel room renovations and conversions of space previously utilized for buffets.
We also expect to spend in 2022 an additional $50 million for the Treasure Chest and Fremont projects.
As Keith mentioned, our board authorized the resumption of our quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, which is more than double our previous quarterly amount.
Also in late October, our board approved a $300 million share repurchase authorization that was in addition to $61 million remaining from our previous authorization.
Since last October, we have repurchased $150 million in stock, representing approximately 2.5 million shares.
We have approximately $210 million remaining under our current repurchase authorizations.
For this year, assuming our business continues to perform at these levels and subject, of course, to board approval, we currently plan to repurchase on a recurring basis of approximately $100 million per quarter.
So in total, with our planned share repurchases and the announced dividend, we expect to return approximately $500 million to shareholders this year.
