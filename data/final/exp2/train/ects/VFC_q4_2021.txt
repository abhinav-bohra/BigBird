Our China business also remained consistently strong throughout fiscal '21 growing 20% and surpassing $1 billion in revenue and exceeding our long-term plan targets.
We have generated approximately $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '21, a testament to the resiliency of our portfolio and strong execution from our global teams.
