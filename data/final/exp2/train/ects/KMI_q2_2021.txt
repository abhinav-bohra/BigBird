The first was our purchase of the Stagecoach natural gas storage and pipeline assets in the Northeast for approximately $1.2 billion.
Our second acquisition is to make an attractive platform investment in the rapidly growing renewable natural gas market by purchasing Kinetrex for approximately $300 million.
On the Stagecoach, storage and transportation assets drew $1.2 billion.
It adds 41 Bcf of certificated and pretty flexible working gas storage capacity and 185 miles of pipeline.
At signing, Kinetrex had secured three new signed development projects that we will build out over the next 18 months, resulting in a purchase price plus capital at a less than six times EBITDA multiple by the time we get to 2023.
Transport volumes were up 4% or approximately 1.5 dekatherms per day versus the second quarter of 2020.
Physical deliveries to LNG off of our pipeline averaged approximately 5 million dekatherms per day.
LNG volumes also increased versus the first quarter of this year by approximately 8%.
Our market share of LNG export volumes is about 48%.
Exports to Mexico were up about 20% versus the second quarter of 2020.
Our share of Mexico volumes is about 54%.
Deliveries to LDCs were down slightly, while deliveries to industrial facilities were up 4%.
Our natural gas gathering volumes were down about 12% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of '20.
So compared to the first quarter of this year, volumes were up about 6%.
And here, we saw nice increases in Hiland volumes, which were up about 10%, and the Haynesville volumes, reports were up about 13%.
In our products pipeline segment, refined products were up 37% for the quarter versus the second quarter of '20.
Volumes are also up about 17% versus the first quarter of this year.
Compared to the pre-pandemic levels, and we're using the second quarter of 2019 as the reference point, road fuels, and that's gasoline and diesel combined, are essentially flat, and jet fuel is still down about 26%.
Crude and condensate volumes were up 6% in the quarter versus the second quarter of '20, and sequentially, they were up very slightly.
If you exclude the tanks out of service or required inspections, approximately 98% of our tanks are leased.
Most of the revenue that we receive comes from fixed monthly charges we receive for tanks under lease, but we do receive a marginal amount of revenue from throughput, and we saw throughput increase significantly, about 22% in total on our liquids terminals, 26% if you're just looking at refined products.
But that still remains a little bit below 2019, up 6% on total liquids volumes, 5% when you're just looking at gasoline and diesel.
On the bulk side, volumes increased by 23%, and that was driven by coal and steel.
In the CO2 segment, crude volumes were down about 9%.
CO2 volumes were down about 10% year over year.
But if you compare to our budget, we're currently anticipating the oil volumes will exceed our budget by approximately 5%, and that's driven primarily by some nice performance on SACROC.
As we said in the release, we're currently projecting full-year DCF of $5.4 billion.
The range we gave you last quarter was $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion.
For the second quarter of 2021, we're declaring a dividend of $0.27 per share, which is $1.08 annualized, and that's up 3% from the second quarter of 2020.
This quarter, we generated revenue of 3.15 billion, which is up 590 million from the second quarter of 2020.
We also had higher cost of sales with an increase there of 495 million.
So netting those two together, gross margin was up 95 million.
This quarter, we also took an impairment of our South Texas gathering and processing assets of 1.6 billion.
So with that impact, we generated a loss -- net loss of 757 million for the quarter.
Looking at adjusted earnings, which is before certain items, primarily the South Texas asset impairment this quarter and the midstream goodwill impairment a year ago, we generated income of $516 million this quarter, up $135 million from the second quarter of 2020.
Natural gas -- our natural gas segment was up $48 million for the quarter, and that was up primarily due to favorable margins in our Texas Intrastate business, greater contributions from our PHP asset, which is now in service; and increased volumes on our Bakken gas gathering systems.
Our product segment was up $66 million driven by a nice recovery in refined product volume.
Terminals was up 17 million, also driven by the nice refined product volume recovery, partially offset by lower utilization of our Jones Act tankers.
Our CO2 segment was down $5 million due to lower crude oil and CO2 volumes and some increased well work costs.
Our G&A and corporate charges were lower by $7 million.
Our JV DD&A category was lower by $27 million primarily due to Ruby.
And that brings us to our adjusted EBITDA of $1.670 billion, which is 7% higher than the second quarter of 2020.
Interest expense was $16 million favorable, driven by our lower LIBOR rates benefiting our interest rate swaps, as well as a lower debt balance and lower rates on our long-term debt.
Our cash taxes for the quarter were unfavorable $40 million, mostly due to Citrus, our products Southeast pipeline and Texas margin tax deferrals, which were taken in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, just timing.
Our sustaining capital was unfavorable $51 million for the quarter driven by higher spend in our natural gas, CO2 and Terminals segments, but that higher spend is in line with what we had budgeted for the quarter.
Our total DCF of $1.025 billion is up 2%, and our DCF per share of $0.45 per share is up $0.01 from last year.
On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 3.8 times debt-to-EBITDA, which is down nicely from 4.6 times at year-end.
For debt-to-EBITDA, we expect to end the year at 4.0 times.
The net debt for the quarter ended at 30 billion, almost 30.2 billion, down 1.847 billion from year-end and about $500 million down from Q1.
Our net debt has now declined by over $12 billion or about 30% since our peak levels.
To reconcile the change in the quarter in net debt, we generated 1.025 billion of DCF.
We paid out approximately 600 million of dividends.
We spent approximately $100 million of growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures.
And we had $175 million of working capital source of cash flows, primarily interest expense accrual.
For the change year-to-date, we generated $3.354 billion of distributable cash flow.
We spent $1.2 billion on dividends.
We've spent $300 million on growth capex and JV contributions.
We received $413 million on our partial interest sale of NGPL.
And we have experienced a working capital use of approximately $425 million, and that explains the majority of the change for the year.
