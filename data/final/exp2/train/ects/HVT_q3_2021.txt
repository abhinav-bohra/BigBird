We're very pleased with another record quarter with sales of $260.4 million and net income of $24.2 million.
In the past several months, we've added over 500 online exclusive products, including outdoor products and specialty occasional items which have had good response.
We expect to end 2021 with 121 stores, one store over last year.
Recently, we've had very good results with stores in the 30,000 to 35,000 square foot size, a building size with more availability.
We expect we will be in the same range as we had last -- this year, approximately $35 million net.
As we just released, our fourth quarter written sales were down approximately 3.5% from the same period last year with delivered sales up 17.5% over last year.
For perspective, this year's Q4 written sales to date are up 20.9% and delivered are up 41.5% over 2019.
Our warehouse inventory levels rose over 8% for the third quarter, and we are seeing our inventories continue to rise so far in October.
However, it will be a slow process to get back to 100% production.
Majority of the vendors feel like they will be able to get back to 50% to 75% of production by Chinese New Year with a return to 100% not happening until late first quarter next year.
A few vendors did give a more upbeat outlook that they will be back to 100% production by the end of November because of the safety and medical protocols that they had in place.
We continue to balance our shipping mix so that no more than 20% to 30% is on the water at one time at these spot market rates.
In the third quarter of 2021, delivered sales were $260.4 million, a 19.7% increase over the prior year quarter.
Total written sales for the third quarter of 2021 were up 2% over the prior year period.
Comparable store sales were up 17.7% over the prior year period.
Our gross profit margin increased 60 basis points from 56.2% to 56.8% due to better merchandise pricing and mix and less promotional activity during the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $16.1 million or 16% to $116.2 million, primarily due to increased sales activity.
However, as a percentage of sales, these costs declined 1,400 basis points to 44.6% from 46%.
As Steve mentioned earlier, during the third quarter of 2021, we did experience increased port congestion and we incurred significant demurrage costs of approximately $2.3 million, which negatively impacted our selling, general and administrative costs.
Other income in the third quarter of 2020 was $2.4 million, which includes the gain on surplus property that was adjacent to our distribution center in Dallas, Texas.
Income before income taxes increased $7.4 million to $31.9 million.
Our tax expense was $7.7 million during the third quarter of 2021, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 24%.
Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $24.2 million or $1.31 per diluted share on our common stock compared to net income of $18.3 million or $0.97 per share in the comparable quarter of last year.
Now looking at our balance sheet, at the end of the third quarter, our inventories were $119 million, which was actually up $29.1 million from the December 31, 2020 balance and up $28 million versus the Q3 2020 balance.
At the end of the third quarter, our customer deposits were $120.1 million, which was up $34 million from the December 31, 2020 balance and up $31.7 million versus the Q3 2020 balance.
We ended the quarter with $232.3 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Capital expenditures were $28.1 million for the first nine months of 2021 and we paid $13 million of regular dividends during the first nine months of 2021.
During the third quarter, we purchased $19.5 million of common stock as 537,196 shares.
As previously reported, our board of directors authorized an additional $25 million of share repurchases.
At the end of the third quarter of 2021, we had $22.3 million remaining under current authorization in our buyback program.
We continue to expect our gross profit margins for 2021 to be between 56.5% to 56.8%.
Our fixed and discretionary type SG&A expenses for 2021 are expected to be in the $278 million to $281 million range, an increase over our previous estimate, primarily due to rising warehouse and demurrage costs.
The variable-type costs within SG&A for 2021 are expected to be in the range of 17% to 17.3%.
Our planned capex for 2021 remains at $37 million, anticipated new replacement stores, remodels and expansions account for $18.7 million, investments in our distribution network are expected to be $15.2 million and investments in our information technology are expected to be approximately $3.1 million in 2021.
Our anticipated effective tax rate for this year is expected to be 24%.
