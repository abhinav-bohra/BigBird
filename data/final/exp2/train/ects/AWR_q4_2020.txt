For the year, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.33 as compared to $2.28 reported for 2019 or $2.24 per share after excluding the $0.04 per share retroactive impact of the electric general rate case decision from 2019 related to the full year of 2018.

Turning to Slide 11, our water and electric supply costs were $24.1 million for the quarter, an increase of $900,000 from the same period last year.
Looking at total operating expenses excluding supply costs, consolidated expenses increased approximately $5.8 million versus the fourth quarter of 2019, mostly due to an increase in construction costs at ASUS as a result of the higher construction activity and property and other taxes, partially offset by lower maintenance expenses resulting from timing differences and a decrease in outside service costs.
Other income and expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a net expense of $2.1 million, which was $1.8 million lower in the same period of last year due to lower interest rate, as well as an increase in gains generated on investments held in the trust to fund a retirement benefit plan.
Consolidated earnings for 2020 were $2.33 per share as compared to $2.28 per share for 2019.

Earnings from the water segment increased by $0.05 per share as compared to 2019, mostly due to new water rates as result of the full second-year step increase effective January 1, 2020, which added $10.4 million in water gross margins for 2020.

AWR parent's earnings decreased $0.01 per share compared to 2019 due to higher state unitary taxes recorded at the parent level.
Net cash provided by operating activities were $122.2 million as compared to $116.9 million in 2019.
The increase was primarily due to the refunding of $7.2 million to customers in 2019 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with no similar refund in 2020 and an increase in water customer usage.
As Bob mentioned, our regulated utility invested $123.4 million in company-funded capital projects in 2020.

During 2020, the U.S. government awarded ASUS $15.5 million in new construction projects for completion in 2020 and 2021.
