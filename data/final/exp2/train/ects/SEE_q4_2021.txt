This is an example of a $7 million automated protein system, with less than a three-year payback, providing a step-change improvement for our customers' operations.
We continue with parts and services being 2x over the equipment life cycle, and the automation and integration opportunities represent 3x as our high-performance materials such as paper and films, along with digital graphics, flow through the system, that takes us well over 10 times the value of the original equipment order.
We continue to make significant progress on our 2025 sustainability pledge, with approximately 50% of our solutions already designed for recyclability, and we reached approximately 20% recycled and/or renewable content in those solutions.
Approximately 15% of our solutions are fiber-based.
