Interest and other income decreased to approximately $35,000 versus $537,000 in the prior year, primarily reflecting the lower interest rate environment.
We reported $2 million of net income reportable to REX shareholders from discontinued operations for the third quarter.
This also resulted in us reporting a tax provision of $4.3 million for the third quarter of this year versus a provision of $5 million in the prior year from our continuing operations.
These factors led to net income attributable to REX shareholders from continuing operations of $13.3 million for this year's third quarter versus $9 million in the prior year, a 47% improvement.
Our net income per share from continuing operations attributable to REX shareholders was $2.23 for this year versus a $1.47 in the prior year.

We bought back almost 67,000 shares in the quarter, we're working on our carbon capture project which Zafar again will talk about.
