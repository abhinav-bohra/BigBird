Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.41.
For CooperVision, our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio led the way with all 3 regions posting strong growth.
Within the regions, the Americas grew 16%, led by MyDay and clariti and continued improvement in patient flow.
EMEA grew a healthy 24% as consumer activity returned in the region, and we took share.
1 in EMEA, and we're seeing the benefits of increasing patient flow, So, we'll continue investing to support the reopening activity happening in many of the European markets.
Asia Pac grew 18%, led by a slow but steady improvement in consumer activity.
Silicone hydrogel dailies grew 31% and with MyDay and clariti both performing well.
Recent data shows that over 90% of contact lens wearers over the age of 40 expect to continue wearing lenses with the biggest challenge being finding a good multifocal.
Our portfolio grew a robust 90% this quarter to $18 million, with MiSight up 187% to $5 million and ortho-k products up 68%.
We continue targeting $65 million in myopia management sales this year, including MiSight reaching $20 million.
As an example, it's estimated that over 80% of high school kids are myopic, So, treating children at a younger age is of high importance in the country.
We now have over 40,000 children wearing MiSight worldwide, and that number is growing quickly.
Additionally, the average age of a new MiSight wearer remains 11, So, this treatment is bringing children into contact lenses at a much younger age.
On a longer-term basis, the macro growth trends remained solid, with roughly 33% of the world being myopic today, and that number is expected to increase to 50% by 2050.
This was an outstanding quarter with record revenues of $206 million.
Fertility, in particular, continued to perform exceptionally well, growing 72% year over year to $83 million.
And with an addressable market opportunity of well over $1 billion and mid- to upper-single-digit growth, this is a great market for us.
And that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility.
Within our office and surgical unit, we grew 50% with PARAGARD up 51% and office and surgical medical devices up 49%.
For PARAGARD, we implemented a roughly 6% price increase toward the end of the quarter, which resulted in a buy-in of roughly $4 million.
To wrap up on CooperSurgical, this was another excellent quarter, and it was great to exceed $200 million in sales for the first time ever.
Third-quarter consolidated revenues increased 32% year over year or 28% in constant currency to $763 million.
Consolidated gross margin increased year over year to 68.3%, up from 66.3% with CooperVision posting higher margins driven by product mix and currency, and CooperSurgical posting higher margins from product mix tied to the significant year-over-year growth in fertility and PARAGARD.
Opex grew 28% as sales increased with a rebound in revenues, along with higher sales and marketing expenses associated with investments in areas such as myopia management.
Consolidated operating margins were strong at 26.6%, up from 23.2% last year.
Interest expense was $5.6 million and the effective tax rate was 13.5%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.41 with roughly 49.8 million average shares outstanding.
Free cash flow was very strong at $180 million, comprised of $224 million of operating cash flow, offset by $44 million of capex.
Net debt decreased to $1.5 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio improved to one and a half times.
Specific to Q4, consolidated revenues are expected to range from $730 million to $760 million, up 7% to 11% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues between $540 million and $560 million up 6% to 10% in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues between $190 million and $200 million, up 8.5% to 14% in constant currency.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.24 to $3.44.
To provide color on this guidance, currency moves since last quarter have reduced the benefit of the full-year FX tailwind from 3% to 2.5% for revenues, and 7% to 5% for EPS.
With respect to Q4, this equates to reducing revenues by $10 million in CooperVision and $2 million at CooperSurgical, and reducing earnings per share by $0.14.
CooperVision is offsetting some of the impact with expected strength in daily silicone and myopia management sales, while CooperSurgical is expecting continued strength, although incorporating the Q3 PARAGARD buy-in of $4 million and hopefully some conservatism regarding COVID's impact on elective procedures.
Consolidated gross margins for the fiscal year are expected to be around 68%, with fiscal Q4 gross margins expected to be around 67.5%, driven primarily by currency.
Our Q4 tax rate is expected to be around 11%.
And lastly, our free cash flow continues to improve, and we're now expecting roughly $550 million for the full year.
