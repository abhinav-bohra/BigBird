Before we review the results, I'd like to recognize the resilience of the Douglas Elliman team of 6,700 agents and 750 employees in addressing the challenges of 2020.
For the three months ended December 31, 2020, Douglas Elliman reported $267.5 million in revenues, net income of $14 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $16.7 million compared to $178.1 million in revenues and net loss of $432,000, and adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Douglas Elliman's net loss for the year ended December 31, '21 included pre-tax charges for non-cash impairments of $58.3 million as well as restructuring charges and related asset write-offs of $4.6 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, Douglas Elliman's revenues increased by 50% from the fourth quarter of 2019 as its closed sales continue to improve in rural markets complementary to New York City, including the Hamptons, Palm Beach, Miami, Aspen and Los Angeles.
Furthermore, Douglas Elliman's expense reduction initiatives continued in the fourth quarter and its fourth quarter 2020 operating and administrative expenses, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, declined by approximately $7.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and $47.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
During the fourth quarter Liggett continued its strong year-to-date performance with revenue increases and margin growth contributing to a 33% increase in tobacco adjusted operating income.
As noted on previous calls, we are well into the income growth phase of our Eagle 20's business strategy and remain very pleased with the results.
Our market-specific retail programs have proven successful, and we remain optimistic about Eagle 20's increasing profit contributions and long-term potential.
The three months and year ended December 31, 2020 revenues were $286.1 million and $1.2 billion, respectively compared to $260.3 million and $1.11 billion for the corresponding 2019 periods.
Tobacco adjusted operating income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020 were $80 million and $320.2 million, respectively compared to $60.1 million and $262.6 million for the corresponding periods a year ago.
According to Management Science Associates, overall industry wholesale shipments for the fourth quarter increased by 3.4% while Liggett's wholesale shipments increased by 2.1% compared to the fourth quarter in 2019.
For the fourth quarter, Liggett's retail shipments declined 0.3% from 2019, while industry retail shipments increased 0.6% during the same period.
Liggett's retail share in the fourth quarter declined slightly to 4.21% from 4.25% in the same period last year.
It remains the third largest discount brand in the U.S. and is currently sold in approximately 84,000 stores nationwide.
With that in mind and after identifying volume growth opportunities in the U.S. deep discount segment, in August we expanded the distribution of our Montego brand to an additional 10 states, primarily in the southeast.
Montego represented 8.6% of Liggett's volume for the fourth quarter 2020, and 6.3% of Liggett's volume for the year ended December 31, 2020.
To date, we remain very pleased with the initial response to Montego now sold in approximately 25,000 stores representing a 50% increase from the end of the third quarter.
