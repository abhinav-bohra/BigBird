This quarter 3, we've seen the REPREVE hang tags with our co-branding partners increase by 80%.
Now that number year-to-date is 50% so that we can see the trends continuing to strengthen.
For the fiscal year, we expect to end the year at 90 million hang tags on products across the marketplace, so the awareness of our brand is climbing in a very positive way.
I got to say that I'm very proud of the team, and I'm grateful for their resiliency over these last 12 months.
Q3 revenues were up 10% sequentially and 5% on a year-over-year basis, with solid performance across all segments and geographies.
We generated a 530 basis point improvement in gross margin year-over-year due to the strong results we saw in our Brazil and Asia segments.
I am pleased to report that momentum remains, comprising 33% of net sales in this Q3 -- in Q3 versus 29% for the year ago quarter.
In March, our sponsorship of the Pac-12 Team Green resulted in additional television advertising on the Pac-12 network and ESPN, with circular economy stories that explain how we take bottles from many university campuses and transform them into well-known branded apparel that can be purchased from their university bookstores.
This quarter, we hit a milestone of 25 billion bottles recycled into REPREVE.
That said, over the last nine months, the Polyester segment has shown strength, achieving a gross margin of 10% during the pandemic versus 8.2% in the prior pre-pandemic comparable period.
As such, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of expense in the just completed quarter that was originally anticipated for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.
Of this additional expense, approximately 2/3 affected SG&A expense and the other 1/3 affected cost of sales.
We disposed of some older machinery with remaining book value, generating a noncash loss of $2.5 million in this third quarter.
Consolidated net sales increased to $178.9 million, up 4.6% from $171.0 million in Q3 of fiscal 2020.
The Asia segment exhibited a return to pre-pandemic momentum with continued underlying demand from REPREVE, driving segment revenue growth of 25.5%.
The Brazil segment maintained its position of market strength, adjusting prices to accommodate movements in global pricing dynamics and competition, driving 22.1% revenue growth in spite of a much weaker Brazilian real than one year ago.
Slide six provides an overview of gross profit, exhibiting the 66% increase in gross profit and 530 basis point increase in gross margin from Q3 fiscal 2020 to Q3 fiscal 2021.
Gross profit for the Polyester segment increased $190,000 as the shortfall in sales volume was more than offset by an improved sales mix.
The Asia segment was able to increase gross profit by $2.6 million or 290 basis points from an improved sales mix and supply chain efficiencies.
In Brazil, we were able to triple gross profit from $3.4 million to $10.6 million and achieved a record gross margin of 41.2% due to higher pricing levels underpinned by a strong market position.
Great progress recently on our net debt metric, we continue to have 0 borrowings on our ABL revolver, which had an availability of $63 million as of March 28, 2021.
Unifi's commitment to financial health has allowed us to leverage our strong balance sheet during 12 months challenged by the global pandemic.
With this sustained business momentum, the company anticipates sales volumes to increase and June 2021 quarter net sales to improve sequentially on the March 2021 quarter by approximately 1% to 3%.
Its adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of $12 million and $14 million and includes our current expectations for the following: pandemic uncertainty, especially following a quarter of record performance from the Brazil segment; raw material cost increases that occurred in the March 2021 quarter that will adversely impact gross profit for the June 2021 quarter due to the inherent lag in responsive selling price adjustments, with those impacts partially offset by a lack of incentive compensation expense due to the full recognition during the first nine months of fiscal 2021.
Lastly, we expect an effective tax rate of between 45% and 55%.
And given the momentum from the third quarter, our fourth quarter capex should fall in the range of $10 million to $12 million.
