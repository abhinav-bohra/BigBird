Barring the company's strong fourth quarter performance and underlying fundamental trends, WAL earned net income of $192.5 million and earnings per share of $1.90 for the quarter, up $108 million year-over-year and nearly flat to Q4.
Net revenue expanded 4.5 times the rate of expense as improvement in asset quality and economic conditions drove a $32.4 million relief in loan loss reserve this quarter.
Our focus continues to be on PPNR growth, which rose approximately 31% year-over-year to $202 million while marginally lower than last quarter due to two fewer days.
Additionally, we signed agreements with the sale of approximately $750 million of mortgage servicing rights to strong counterparties that will allow Western Alliance to retain substantially all the custodial deposits.
Turning to the first quarter balance sheet trends, outstating quarterly loan and deposit growth of $1.7 billion and $6.5 billion respectively, lifted total assets to $43.4 billion, up 49% from the prior year.
Our deposit growth was broad-based across our franchise, which pushed down our loan-to-deposit ratio of 75% and creates a strong funding foundation for ongoing loan and earnings growth from our commercial loan pipeline and the AmeriHome acquisition.
This impressive loan growth drove net interest income of $317.3 million, or $2.5 million higher than last quarter and up 18% on a year-over-year basis.
Quarterly net interest margin was 3.37%, down 47% from the fourth quarter as we continued to deploy excess liquidity into loans and investment securities.
Non-interest income totaled $19.7 million for the quarter, aided by $7.3 million of warrant income from Bridge Bank.
For the quarter, net loan charge-offs were $1.4 million or 2 basis points on an annualized basis.
Finally, Western Alliance continues to generate significant excess capital, which grew tangible book value per share to $33.02, or 23.5% year-over-year -- or 23.5% year-over-year growth.
We remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of 1.93% and 24.2%, respectively.
For the quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $192.5 million or $1.90 per share, each down about 1% from the prior quarter.
This is inclusive of a reversal of credit loss provisions of $32.4 million due to continued improvement in economic forecasts relative to year-end 2020 and continued loan [Phonetic] -- in [Phonetic] loan segments with historically very low loss rates.
Additionally, merger expenses related to the AmeriHome acquisition of $400,000 were recognized.
We expect total merger charges to be approximately $15 million, preponderance of which will be incurred in Q2 as integration continues.
Net interest income grew $2.5 million during the quarter to $317.3 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year, primarily as a result of our significant balance sheet growth.
However, while average earning assets grew $5.7 billion, the relative proportion held in cash and lower-yielding securities increased to approximately 32% in Q1 from 22% in Q4, which temporarily muted our interest income growth as we prepare to deploy excess liquidity into AmeriHome-generated assets and higher-yielding commercial loans.
Quarter-over-quarter, our loan-to-deposit ratio fell to 75% from 85% in Q4 as we proactively look to grow low-cost deposits as dry powder for future loan growth.
Non-interest income fell $4.1 million to $19.7 million from the prior quarter, mainly driven by smaller fair value gain adjustments in our securities measured at fair value, but partially offset by $7.3 million in the warrant income.
Non-interest expense increased $2.8 million, mainly due to higher deposit costs as lower rates were offset by higher average balances.
Continued balance sheet growth generating superior net interest income drove pre-provision net revenue of $202 million, up over 30% from a year ago.
Total investments grew $2.4 billion for the quarter or 43% to $7.9 billion compared to an average balance of $6.5 billion.
Investment yields declined 24 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.37% due to lower reinvestment rates in the current environment.
Similarly, on a linked-quarter basis, linked -- loan yields declined 8 basis points following ongoing mix shift toward residential loans and asset class with generally lower yields than the remainder of the portfolio and lower credit risk.
Significantly, quarter-end balances for loans and investments were $3.3 billion higher than the average balances and yielded 3.5% more than our Fed account.
Interest-bearing deposit costs were reduced by 3 basis points in Q1 to 22 basis points, due to ongoing repricing efforts and maturities of higher cost CDs.
The spot rate for total deposits, which includes non-interest-bearing, was 11 basis points.
Net interest income increased $2.5 million to $317.3 million during the quarter or 18% year-over-year as higher loan and investment balances offset net interest margin compression.
NIM declined 47 basis points to 337 basis points as our purposeful strong deposit growth in advance of closing the AmeriHome acquisition negatively impacted the margin by 43 basis points.
To put this in perspective, average securities and cash balances to interest-earning assets increased meaningfully in Q1 32% from 22%.
Additionally, a PPP loan yield of 4.9% benefited the NIM by 8 basis points, which was similar to the fourth quarter benefit.
Cumulatively, over the remainder of 2021, we expect to recognize $15.4 million of BBB fees.
Our efficiency ratio rose 90 basis points to 39.1%, an increase from 38.2% in Q4.
Non-interest expense linked quarter growth increased by 2.1%, driven by higher deposit fees related to the 82% annualized rise in deposit balances.
Excluding PPP, net loan fees and interest, the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been 41%.
Pre-provision net revenue declined $4.4 million or 2.1% from the prior quarter, but increased 31% from the same period last year.
This results in PPNR and our ROA of 2.03% for the quarter, a decrease of 21 basis points compared to 2.24% for the year-ago period, partially impacted by a much larger asset base.
Balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $1.7 billion or 6.1% to $28.7 billion and deposit growth of $6.5 billion brought balances to $38.4 billion at quarter end.
Inclusive of the second round of PPP funding, loans grew 24% year-over-year, while deposits grew approximately 55% year-over-year, with our focus on low loan loss segments and DDA.
In all, total assets have grown 49% year-over-year as we approach the $50 billion asset level, including AmeriHome.
Finally, tangible book value per share increased $2.12 over the prior quarter to $33.02, an increase of $6.29 or 23.5% over the prior year, attributable to both net income and the common stock offering of 2.3 million shares completed during Q1 in anticipation of the AmeriHome acquisition.
The majority of the $1.7 billion in growth was driven by an increase in C&I loans of $746 million.
Loan growth was also strong in residential real estate loans of $675 million, supplemented by construction loans of $337 million and CRE non-owner-occupied loans of $27 million.
Residential and consumer loans now comprise 10.9% of our loan portfolio, an increase from 9.9% a year ago.
Within the C&I growth for the quarter and highlighting our focus on low-risk assets, mortgage warehouse loans grew $562 million and Round 2 3P [Phonetic] loans, originations were $560 million, which were nearly offset by $479 million from Round 1 of payoffs.
Deposits grew $6.5 billion or 20% in the first quarter driven by increases in non-interest-bearing DDA of $4.1 billion, which now comprise 46% of our deposit base and the savings in money market of $2.9 billion.
Total classified assets increased $57 million in Q1 to $281 million due to migration of a few borrowers and COVID-impacted industries, such as travel, leisure and entertainment as reopening continues but at an uneven pace.
Our non-performing loans plus OREO ratio declined to 27 basis points to total assets and total classified assets rose 4 basis points to total assets up to 0.65% compared to the ratio at the end of 2020.
Special mention loans increased $23 million during the quarter to 1.65% of funded loans.
Regarding loan deferrals, as of quarter end, we had $68.5 million of deferrals, all of which are in low LTV residential loans.
Quarterly net credit losses were modest to $1.4 million or 2 basis points of average loans compared to $3.9 million in the fourth quarter.
Our loan ACL fell $36 million from the prior quarter to $280 million due to improvement in macroeconomic forecast loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates.
In all, total loan ACL to funded loans declined 20 basis points to 97 basis points or 1.03% when excluding PPP loans.
For comparison purposes, the loan ACL to funded levels was 84 basis points at year-end 2019 before CECL adoption.
We continue to generate capital and maintain strong regulatory ratios with tangible common equity to total assets of 7.9% weighed down this quarter by strong asset growth, and the common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%, an increase of 40 basis points during the quarter, mainly driven by our common stock offering and growth in low-risk assets.
Inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.25 a share, our tangible book value per share rose $2.12 in the quarter to $33.02, an increase of 23% in the past year.
Going forward, based on our current pipelines, we expect loan and deposit growth of $1 billion to $1.5 billion per quarter, which will drive higher net interest income and PPNR growth.
