Second, we have awaited the reopening of the real estate debt capital markets in order to arrange the refinancing of our $75 million term loan maturing in February 2021, as well as addressing our other upcoming debt maturities.
Considering that our full-year rent expense is approximately $500,000, this is a terrific G&A savings opportunity.
More generally, we anticipate reducing year-over-year G&A by an excess of $2 million through the zero based cost savings approach.
First, we have managed to bounce back from the initial shocks to our business with a collections level this past quarter of 91%, representing among the better performances through the third quarter among retail REITs.
Last, we have tightened up our overhead in the face of all distress with full-year G&A savings anticipated to be in excess of $2 million in 2021.
Our centers remained open during the third quarter with 96% of our tenants opened for business.
We have had another successful quarter of rent collections reaching our highest yet collection rates since the inception of COVID of 91%.
Moreover, October collections are currently at 91%, which does not reflect one high credit anchor that pays at the end of the month, which will take us to approximately 92.5% for October.
In order to ensure tenant health and occupancy, we have actively engaged with almost all of our over 800 tenants during the pandemic.
We completed 105 deferral and waiver agreements through September 30, 2020, totaling $3 million of deferred rent with a required payback beginning over a period ranging between July 2020 and March 2021.
The number of months differed averages four months for an average payback period of 10 months.
$900,000 of rent was waived as of September 30, 2020, for an average of four months.
32 leases were signed this quarter, eight new deals totaling 72,800 square feet, and 24 renewals totaling 167,300 square feet.
The new deals executed were at a positive spread of 21.5% and include two anchor deal Shoppers Road at Jordan Lane [Phonetic] at a spread of 44% and America Sprayed at Golden Triangle [Phonetic] at a spread of 23%.
The renewals were done at a negative spread of 3.1% when analyzed in total.
The spread increases to positive 2.8% excluding these three tenants.
As of September 30, 2020 our current lease same center occupancy is 91.7%, a 0.2% increase from prior quarter.
We contunue last -- I'm sorry, we announced last quarter that our lease was executed with the District of Columbia for a 260,000 square foot office building, including ground floor retail for the Department of General Services.
This government agency comprises more than 700 skilled professional employees with expertise in the areas of construction, building management and maintenance, portfolio management, sustainability and security at district owned properties.
The DGS lease structure includes a 20-year 10-month term based on a net rent of $22.52 per square foot and a gross rent of $56.43 per square foot, which includes a TI amortization of $14.09 per square foot.
The DGS building is a central element of Cedar's vision to realize a true metamorphosis for Ward 7 and is emblematic of the type of neighborhood we are endeavoring to create with Northeast Heights.
FFO increased to $8 million or $0.09 per share, compared to $5.7 million or $0.06 per share reported for the previous quarter.
Same property NOI decreased 9.1% over the comparable period in 2019, and marked improvement from the 14.6% decrease we reported in the previous quarter.
Our total tenant billings for base rent and recoveries combined for this quarter were $31.6 million.
During the quarter, we collected and recognized as revenue $30.1 million or 91% of these billings.
Additionally, we recognized another $1.1 million or 3% as revenue that we determined to be collectible, the majority of which is covered by signed deferral agreements.
Accordingly for this quarter, we recognize as revenue 94% of our build rent and recoveries for the quarter.
The $1.9 million or 6%, that we did not recognize consists of $1.8 million that was not paid by tenants, and which we have determined at this time should be accounted for on a cash basis, and $100,000 that we agreed to waive.
On our prior quarter call, we discussed that we were exploring secured debt to refinance our $75 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in February of 2021.
We are working diligently toward closing secured loans in amount equal to or greater than $75 million in early 2021.
To that end, earlier this week, we utilized our revolving credit facility and retired the $75 million term loan scheduled to mature in February of 2021.
As Robin noted, we have signed deferral agreements for $3 million, of which approximately $250,000 was repaid this quarter, and $250,000 relates to the remainder of the year, resulting in us carrying a $2.5 million receivable for deferral agreements at the end of this quarter.
The vast majority of this receivable is scheduled to be repaid in 2021, with approximately $700,000 in each Q1 and Q2 of 2021, and approximately $500,000 in each Q3 and Q4 of 2021.
This reverse split will not only assist with maintaining compliance with the New York Stock Exchange listing requirements, but will also reset our share price above the $5 minimum requirement of some investment funds and do so while keeping more than 10 million shares outstanding to assist with trading liquidity.
