I'm very proud of the extraordinary achievements of our team in fiscal 2021; record revenue of more than $2 billion record gross margin of over 30%, record earnings per share, all while achieving record net promoter customer satisfaction scores.
For the quarter, we generated 16% revenue growth, record gross margin of almost 38%, and record earnings per share of $1.45.
Our same-store sales for the quarter were down 7% versus 33% growth a year ago.
This strong demand environment is highlighted by our customer deposits, which jumped more than 3 times last year's level to over 100 million.
For the full-year, same-store sales growth was over 13%, on top of 25% a year ago.
This quarter, we increased our operating margin by 130 basis points over last year's record to 9.5%.
We also finished the fiscal year with an operating margin increase of more than 300 basis points to over 10%.
For the quarter, revenue grew 16% to over $462 million, even with the lean inventory environment, as we benefited from the accretive acquisitions we completed during the year.
We expected inventory to remain low through the quarter, but with the increased supply chain challenges, retail deliveries grew more challenging, which impacted revenue in excess of 50 million.
Gross profit dollars increased over $58 million, while our gross margin rose 860 basis points to almost 38%.
Our operating leverage in the quarter was about 15%, which drove very strong earnings growth, setting another quarterly record with pre-tax earnings of over $43 million.
Our record September quarter saw both net income and earnings per share rise over 21%, generating $1.45 in earnings per share versus an adjusted $1.19 a year ago.
And I would add that $6.78 is a pretty strong year.
We continue to build cash with over $220 million.
Our inventory at quarter end was $231 million, down 22%, excluding SkipperBuds and Cruiser Yachts, inventory declined about double that percentage.
Due to the demand we are seeing, customer deposits, as Brett said, more than tripled to over $100 million, setting another new record.
Our current ratio is over 2, and our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio is at 1; both of these are very impressive balance sheet metrics.
Our tangible net worth is about 400 million.
Including the remainder of the Cruisers and Nisswa acquisitions, we expect total annual revenue growth in the high single digits to 10%.
Our guidance is also, before any other acquisitions that we may complete, including Intrepid, using the low end of our historical leverage range, plus a modest share increase and a tax rate of 20%, results in our earnings per share guidance range of $7.20 to $7.50.
Our operating margin ended the fiscal year at over 10%, almost double 2019.
