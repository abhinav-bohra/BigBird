The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter.
And I can just say that sales were higher than our expectations, growing a very strong 134% in U.S. dollars and 117% organically as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market.
That market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter.
Our sales to customers in the mobile devices market declined from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as declines in handsets and laptops more-than-offset growth in wearables.
Sequentially, our sales fell by 6% from the first quarter, which was modestly better than our expectations.

The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter.
Sales were flat to prior year and down 4% organically as sales to both OEMs and wireless service providers moderated.

The information technology and data communications market increased by 21% in the second quarter.
Sales in the second quarter rose by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from the very significant levels in last year's second quarter.

And I would just note that given the current dynamic market environment, and of course, assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as constant exchange rates, in the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.62.
This would represent sales growth of 14% to 16% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 9% to 13% compared to the third quarter of last year.
