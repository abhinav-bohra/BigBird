As we deployed 1 gigabit wireline networks, wireless/wireline converged networks and wireless networks, this quarter reflected an increase in demand from one of our top five customers.
Adjusted gross margins were 14.3% of revenue, reflecting the continued impacts of the complexity of a large customer program.
Adjusted general and administrative expenses were 8.5%, and all of these factors produced adjusted EBITDA of $45.7 million or 6.1% of revenue, an adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.07, compared to a loss of $0.23 in the year ago quarter.
Liquidity was strong as cash and availability under our credit facility was $570.5 million.
