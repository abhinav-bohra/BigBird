Meanwhile, our development of La Jolla Commons III into an 11 story, approximately 210,000 square foot Class A office tower remains on time and on budget for Q2 or Q3 2023 delivery.
Additionally, I'm happy to inform you that our Board of Directors has approved the quarterly dividend of $0.30 a share for the third quarter, which we believe is supported by our expectations for operations to continue trending positively.
Meanwhile, we are encouraged by our approximately 97% collection percentage in Q3, increased leasing activity across all asset classes, fewer tenant failures and bankruptcies than we expected and many modified leases hitting percentage rent thresholds sooner than expected and are collecting of approximately 96% of deferred rents due during the third quarter, all validating the strategies we implemented during COVID to support our struggling retailers through the government-mandated closures as we are fortunate to have the financial ability to do so.
On the multifamily front as of quarter end, we were 96% leased at Hassalo in Portland, and 98% leased in San Diego multifamily portfolio.
Last night we reported third quarter 2021 FFO per share of $0.57, and third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stockholders per share of $0.17.
Third quarter results are primarily comprised of the following: actual FFO increased in the third quarter by approximately 11.4% on a FFO per share basis to $0.57 per FFO share compared to the second quarter of 2021, primarily from the following four items: first, the acquisitions of Eastgate Office Park in Corporate Campus East III in Bellevue, Washington, on July seven and September 10, respectively, added approximately $0.023 of FFO per share in Q3.
Second, Alamo Quarry in San Antonio added approximately $0.017 of FFO per share in Q3, resulting from 2019 and 2020 real estate tax refunds received during the third quarter of 2021, which reduced Alamo Quarry's real estate tax expense.
Third, decrease of bad debt expense at Carmel Mountain Plaza added approximately $0.005 per FFO share in Q3.
And fourth, the Embassy Suites and Waikiki Beach Walk added approximately $0.012 of FFO per share in Q3 due to the seasonality over the summer months.
On our Q2 earnings call, I mentioned that Japan, who was then approximately 9% fully vaccinated, is now over 65% fully vaccinated and is expected to hit 80% by November.
Now as we look at our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2021, our total revenue increased approximately $6.5 million over Q2 '21, which is approximately a 7% increase.
Approximately 43% of that was from the two new office acquisitions.
Same-store cash NOI overall was strong at 14% year-over-year, with office consistently strong before, during and post-COVID and retail showing strong signs of recovery.
Multifamily was flat primarily year-over-year as a result of higher bad debt expense at our Hassalo on eight departments in Portland, but it was still approximately 5% higher than Q2 2021.
As previously disclosed, we acquired Corpus Campus East III on September 10, comprised of an approximately 161,000 square foot multi-tenant office campus located just off Interstate 405 and 520 freeway interchange, less than five minutes away from downtown Bellevue, Washington.
The four building campus is currently 86% leased to a diversified tenant base, which we saw as an opportunity when in-place rents were compared to what we were seeing in the marketplace.
The purchase price of approximately $84 million was paid with cash on the balance sheet.
The going-in cap rate was north of 3% as a result of the existing vacancy.
Our expectation based on our underwriting is that this asset will produce a five year average cap rate over 6% and a strong unlevered IRR of 7%.
At the end of the third quarter, we had liquidity of approximately $522 million, comprised of approximately $172 million in cash and cash equivalents and $350 million of availability on our line of credit.
Our leverage, which we measure in terms of net debt-to-EBITDA was 6.4 times.
Our focus is to maintain our net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.5 times or below.
Our interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.9 times.
The full year range of 2021 is $1.91 to $1.93 per FFO share with a midpoint of $1.92 per FFO share.
With that midpoint, we would expect Q4 2021 to be approximately $0.46 per FFO share.
The $0.11 estimated difference in Q4 FFO per share would be attributable to the following: approximately a negative $0.025 of FFO per share relating to nonrecurring collection of prior rents at one of our theaters in Q3 that will not occur in Q4 2021.
Secondly, our mixed-use properties are expected to be down approximately $0.037 of FFO per share relating to the normal seasonality of the Embassy Suites hotel and the related parking.
Third, Alamo Quarry is expected to be down approximately $0.02 of FFO per share relating to the nonrecurring property tax refund that was received in Q3 2021 for 2019 and 2020.
And we expect G&A and interest expense to increase and therefore, decrease FFO by approximately $0.02 per FFO share.
Our office portfolio grew by approximately 440,000 square feet or nearly 13% in Q3 with the two new office acquisitions.
We brought up these assets on board at approximately 92% leased with approximately 20% rolling through 2022, which provides us with the opportunity to deliver start rates from approximately 10% to 30% over ending rents.
At the end of the third quarter at One Beach, which remains under redevelopment, our office portfolio is approximately 93% leased with 1.5% expiring through the end of 2021, approximately 9% expiring in 2022 with tour and proposed activity that has increased significantly.
In the second and third quarters, we executed 57,000 annual square feet of comparable new and renewal leases with increases over prior rent of 9.2% and 14.5% on a cash and straight-line basis respectively.
New start rates for the 2021 rollover are estimated to be approximately 17% above the ending rates.
In fact, we are at least documentation for over half of the space rolling in 2021 as start rates nearly 28% over ending rates.
New start rates for the 2022 rollovers are estimated to be approximately 18% above the ending rates.
Those two buildings represent 80% of the total project vacancy.
In addition to One Beach Street and La Jolla Commons previously mentioned by Ernest, construction is nearly complete on the redevelopment of seven Tower Square in the, on our market at Portland, which will add another 32,000 rentable square feet to the office portfolio.
