Q4 was another record for SmartSide as sales increased by 30% to $259 million and Siding EBITDA nearly doubled over -- year-over-year to $77 million.
OSB prices remained exceptionally high throughout the quarter, resulting in $250 million in EBITDA for the OSB segment.
As a result, LP ended 2020 with $2.8 billion in sales, $781 million in EBITDA, $660 million in operating cash flow and $4.31 in earnings per share.
That plan included a three-year target of $165 million in cumulative EBITDA improvements from growth, operating efficiency and strategic sourcing.
Today, I am proud to announce that we have exceeded this target a year ahead of schedule with $177 million in cumulative impact delivered in only two years.
Phase 1 will be the conversion of our mill in Houlton, Maine from production of Laminated Strand Lumber and OSB to SmartSide.
Houlton will add roughly 220 million square feet of SmartSide capacity with production beginning early in 2022.
Phase 2 of the SmartSide capacity expansion strategy will be the conversion of our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan.
These two new facilities will add roughly 520 million square feet of additional SmartSide capacity and remove roughly 670 million feet of OSB capacity.
The consensus for 2021 housing starts has climbed for the past several months and is now, in the year, 1.5 million.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, December starts were at 1.6 million and permits were 1.7 million suggesting continued strength in new residential construction.
As we have been keeping the mill ready for an eventual restart, the cost to resume production shall not exceed $12 million.
Sagola's conversion will add roughly 300 million square feet to SmartSide capacity and remove roughly 420 million square feet of OSB capacity.
While the exact timing of Sagola's conversion to SmartSide is still to be determined, the graph illustrates initial SmartSide production in the second half of 2023, which is consistent with an annual demand growth rate of 11%.
The plan, once fully implemented, will increase total SmartSide capacity by roughly 520 million square feet or a little over 30%.
The net effect of Houlton and Sagola's conversion and the Peace Valley restart will increase LP's OSB capacity by less than 100 million feet.
Net sales increased by 60% to $860 million, primarily due to 30% growth of SmartSide and $246 million of higher OSB prices.
The resulting EBITDA of $328 million is 7 times last year's result and translated nearly dollar for dollar to operating cash flow of $321 million with the benefit of $45 million in tax refunds.
We further lowered our year-end share count to 106 million shares after spending $171 million in the quarter to buy back a little over 5 million shares, and with taxes as the only meaningful adjustment to net income, adjusted earnings per share was $2.01 compared to U.S. GAAP earnings per share of $2.34.
Net sales increased by 21% to $2.8 billion and EBITDA increased to $781 million, which is 4 times last year's result.
We grew SmartSide revenue by 15% and $481 million of revenue and EBITDA from higher OSB prices and generated $659 million in operating cash flow.
Capital spending of $77 million ended up being about half our original pre-COVID guidance for 2020.
The vast majority of this $77 million was spent on sustaining maintenance, which typically runs in the $80 million to $100 million range per year.
As a result, we ended the year with $535 million in cash after paying $65 million in dividends and $200 million to repurchase shares.
As Brad said, we exceeded our three-year target of $165 million in cumulative EBITDA impact a year early with $107 million from growth and $71 million from efficiency.
The main takeaway here is that higher OSB prices and 30% SmartSide growth tell us all we need to know about the quarter.
Having said that, and while not shown here, our South America segment had a record quarter with $50 million of sales and $13 million of EBITDA, representing increases of 32% and 62%, respectively even after adverse currency movements.
The waterfalls on Slides 12 and 13 detail the year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth in the Siding and OSB segments for the quarter.
In broad strokes, the 30% revenue growth for the quarter reflects a 95% increase in retail revenue and a 20% increase in distribution revenue.
And with an incremental margin of $0.51 on each additional dollar of revenue, this $59 million of SmartSide growth produced $30 million of additional EBITDA.
With low SG&A and higher OEE more than offsetting the discontinuation of Fiber, the Siding segment EBITDA margin increased by 12 percentage points to 30%.
However, given the operating leverage and pricing power inherent in the business, we are raising our long-term target for the Siding EBITDA margin by 5 percentage points to 25%.
On Slide 13, very high market demand for OSB pushed prices to record levels adding $246 million of revenue and EBITDA in the quarter which rather overshadows both the continued excellence of our cost control and the growth of Structural Solutions, which rose to 49% of total OSB volume.
We are, therefore, raising our long-term target of Structural Solutions volume as a percentage of total OSB volume by 5 percentage points to 55%.
The use of phenolic resins in OSB lowers line speeds which we estimate lost us $8 million of potential revenue and $3 million of potential EBITDA in the fourth quarter.
The Houlton conversion will cost about the same as the Dawson conversion in 2018, that is about $130 million.
Roughly $80 million to $85 million of that $130 million will be spent in 2021, with the remainder in 2022.
We have other strategic growth projects totaling $30 million to $35 million that will enable us to accelerate our rollout of new products and we have our typical base level of about $100 million in sustaining maintenance.
And as Brad mentioned, the capital required for Peace Valley restart should be around $10 million at most.
As a result, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the range $220 million to $230 million.
We will continue to return to shareholders, which is 50% of cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures required to execute our strategy once that cash has been generated.
So, given that we ended the year with $535 million in cash with a $300 million share buyback authorization from our Board, we will be reentering the market to continue buying back shares in a matter of days.
Halfway through this first quarter of 2021, OSB prices are at least 15% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 on similar volumes.
SmartSide revenue is trending seasonally higher than the fourth quarter, on pace for at least 35% growth compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Should these trends continue and absent COVID outbreaks or sudden reversals in logistics, raw material availability or OSB prices, we expect EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 to be at least $380 million.
