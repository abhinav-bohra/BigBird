Product mix improved operating leverage and solid execution led to a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5% for the third quarter, up 70 basis points from the same period last year.
Although demand for aftermarket parts was solid and made up 69% of total revenue in the quarter, customer delays in capital project execution and the inability of our employees to engage face-to-face with customers and prospects due to the pandemic suppressed our bookings performance.

Parts and consumables revenue, on the other hand, was solid and made up 68% of total revenue in the third quarter.
Encouragingly, U.S. housing starts continue to show strength and were $1.4 million in September, up 11% compared to the same period last year, which benefits our customers producing OSB and dimensional lumber.

Parts and consumables revenue in the third quarter made up 60% of total revenue, but still below historical run rates.

Approximately 110 basis points of this increase was due to the receipt of government assistance benefits related to the pandemic.
The remaining 30 basis point improvement is principally due to better product mix related to a higher percentage of parts and consumables.

SG&A expenses were $43.9 million or 28.4% of revenue in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $47.1 million or 27.1% of revenue in the third quarter of 2019.
The $3.2 million decrease in SG&A expense was principally due to reduced selling and travel-related expenses and a $1 million benefit from government assistance programs.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $30 million or 19.4% of revenue compared to $32.3 million or 18.6% of revenue in the third quarter of 2019.
On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 13% due to increased profitability in our Flow Control and Industrial Processing segments.

As shown in the chart, the decrease of $0.07 and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of 2019 consists of the following: $0.55 due to lower revenue, $0.01 due to higher weighted average shares outstanding.
These decreases were partially offset by $0.18 due to government assistance programs, $0.17 due to lower operating costs, $0.10 due to lower interest expense, $0.02 due to higher gross margin percentages and $0.02 from an acquisition.
Collectively, included in all the categories I just mentioned, was a $0.01 favorable foreign currency translation effect in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter of last year due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar.

During the quarter, we repaid our real estate loan, which had a remaining principal balance of $18.9 million by borrowing from our revolving credit facility.
This effectively swapped debt with an annual interest rate of 4.45% under the real estate loan for U.S. revolver debt currently at 1.65%, which at current rates would reduce interest expense by over $500,000 on an annual basis.
In addition, our leverage ratio calculated in accordance with our credit facility decreased to 1.88 at the end of the third quarter 2020 compared to 2.03 at the end of 2019.
As a result of being below 2, the applicable margin on our revolver debt will decrease by 25 basis points, which at current debt levels, would reduce our interest expense by roughly $600,000 on an annual basis.
Last quarter on our call, I gave a few directional comments indicating our revenue for the year could decrease roughly 11% to 14% compared to 2019.
