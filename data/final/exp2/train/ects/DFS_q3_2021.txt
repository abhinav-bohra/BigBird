Including this, revenue is up 2% for the quarter.
Net charge-offs were down $343 million from the prior year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter.

Card loans were the primary driver and we're also up 1% year-over-year and 2% over the prior quarter.
Sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019.

The payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre-pandemic levels.
Organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with originations up 7% as most schools have returned to the normal in-person learning model.
Personal loans decreased 4% driven by high payment rates.
Moving to Slide 6, net interest margin was 10.8%, up 61 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from the prior quarter.
Card loan yield was up 1 basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased promotional balance mix.
Yield on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially due to lower pricing.
Average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter.
Late in September, we executed our first ABS issuance since October 2019 consisting of a $1.2 billion security with a three-year fixed rate coupon of 58 basis points and a five-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of 103 basis points.
Total non-interest income increased $90 million or 20% over the prior year excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments.
Net discount and interchange revenue was up $61 million or 26% driven by strong sales volume.
This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the 5% category, which was restaurants and PayPal, both this year and last.
We continue to benefit from strong sales through our partnership with PayPal, while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity recovered.
Loan fee income was up $21 million or 21%, primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher non-sufficient funds and cash advance fees.
Total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year.
Employee compensation increased $12 million driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year.
Excluding bonuses, employee compensation was down 3% from their prior year from lower headcount.
Marketing expense increased $70 million supporting another quarter of strong new account growth.
Other expense included a $50 million legal accrual.

This quarter, we released $165 million from reserves and our reserve rate dropped 35 basis points to 7.7%.
The impact of these was partially offset by a 2% increase in loans from the prior quarter.
Our economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and GDP growth of just over 6%.
Our common equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target.
We repurchased $815 million of common stock and as we had previously announced, increased our dividend payable by 14% to $0.50 per share.
On funding, we continue to make progress toward our goals of having deposits be 70% to 80% of our funding mix.
Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62% in the prior year.
