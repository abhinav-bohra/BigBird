First quarter revenue was $390 million, which was above the guidance range of $330 million to $360 million and was also above the $271 million we saw in Q4 and the $292 million in Q1 of last year.
Revenues were better than what we guided as we had a true-up in the quarter of about $20 million that relates to Q4 shipments, and we also had some recoveries in Q1 that came in sooner in the year than we thought.
So the Q1 revenue of $390 million was composed of $373 million in licensing and $17 million in products and services.
Broadcast represented about 37% of total licensing in the first quarter.
Broadcast revenues increased by about 36% year-over-year, and that was driven by higher recoveries; higher adoption of Dolby, including our patent programs; and a higher true-up, which relates to the Q4 shipments.
On a sequential basis, Broadcast was up by about 16%, driven by holiday seasonality for TVs, higher recoveries and higher adoption, offset partially by the lower set-top box activity.
Mobile represented approximately 28% of total licensing in Q1.
Mobile increased by a little over 200% from last year and about 170% from last quarter due primarily to timing of revenue under customer contracts and also helped by higher customer adoption.
Consumer Electronics represented about 14% of total licensing in the first quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, CE licensing was up by about 6%, mainly due to higher adoption of Dolby, including our patent programs.
On a sequential basis, CE increased by about 52%, driven by higher seasonality, higher adoption in our patent programs and timing of revenue under contracts.
PC represented about 9% of total licensing in Q1.
PC was higher than last year by about 3% due to increased adoption of Dolby's premium technologies like Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision.
Sequentially, PC was up by about 5%, driven by higher adoption of those premium Dolby technology.
Other Markets represented about 12% in total licensing in the first quarter.
They were up by about 8% year-over-year, driven by higher gaming from new console releases and also from higher Via admin fees and via the patent pool program that we administer.
On a sequential basis, Other Markets was up by about 33%, driven by higher revenue from gaming and from the Via admin fees.
Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $16.9 million in Q1 compared to $14.3 million in Q4 and $34.2 million in last year's Q1.
Total gross margin in the first quarter was 90.9% on a GAAP basis and 91.5% on a non-GAAP basis.
Products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $5.5 million in Q1 compared to minus $15.5 million in the fourth quarter, and the fourth quarter included large excess of obsolete inventory charges because of our decision to exit the conferencing hardware arena.
Products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $3.9 million in Q1 compared to minus $14.1 million in the fourth quarter.
Operating expenses in the first quarter on a GAAP basis were $189.8 million compared to $198.7 million in Q4.
The Q1 total includes $13.9 million of gain from sale of assets as we completed the disposition of our former Brisbane manufacturing site during the quarter.
But it also includes $10 million of restructuring expense, primarily for severances and the related benefits, consistent with the comments that I made at the beginning of the quarter when I provided guidance.
Operating expenses in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $167.1 million compared to $176.5 million in the fourth quarter.
Operating income in the first quarter was $164.7 million on a GAAP basis or 42.3% of revenue compared to $48.6 million or 16.6% of revenue in Q1 of last year.
Operating income in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $189.7 million or 48.7% of revenue compared to $74.1 million or 25.4% of revenue in Q1 of last year.
Income tax in Q1 was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 19.9% on a non-GAAP basis.
Net income on a GAAP basis in the first quarter was $135.2 million or $1.30 per diluted share compared to $48.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share in last year's Q1.
Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter was $153.3 million or $1.48 per diluted share compared to $65.5 million or $0.64 per diluted share in Q1 of last year.
During the first quarter, we generated about $82 million in cash from operations, which compares to about $31 million generated from operations in last year's first quarter.
And we ended the first quarter this year with about $1.2 billion in cash and investments.
During the first quarter, we bought back about 500,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $147 million of stock repurchase authorization still available to us.
We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.22 per share.
Last quarter, I provided a Q2 revenue scenario of $270 million to $300 million for the quarter.
Today, our scenario is that Q2 revenue could range from $280 million to $310 million.
So if I combine the Q2 actual that we just reported with the Q2 outlook I mentioned a second ago, that would put our first half revenue outlook range at $670 million to $700 million compared to our previous outlook range of $600 million to $660 million.
I already highlighted the revenue range of $280 million to $310 million in total, of which licensing would comprise $270 million to $295 million, while products and services would comprise $10 million to $15 million.
Q2 gross margin on a GAAP basis is estimated to range from 88% to 89%, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to range from 89% to 90%.
Within that, products and services gross margin is estimated to range from minus $3 million to minus $4 million on a GAAP basis and from minus $2 million to minus $3 million on a non-GAAP basis.
Operating expenses in Q2 on a GAAP basis are estimated to range from $200 million to $210 million.
Operating expenses in Q2 on a non-GAAP basis are estimated to range from $175 million to $185 million, and the projected increase from Q1 is driven by the same comments I made about the GAAP operating expenses.
Other income is projected to range from $1 million to $2 million for the quarter, and our effective tax rate for Q2 is projected to range from 20% to 21% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
So based on the combination of the factors I just covered, we estimate that Q2 diluted earnings per share could range from $0.36 to $0.51 on a GAAP basis, and from $0.57 to $0.72 on a non-GAAP basis.
HBO Max became the latest major streaming service to support the combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience, starting with the release of Wonder Woman 1984.
12 new Dolby Cinema locations around the world were opened this quarter, including our first site in Taiwan.
With the release of iPhone 12 at the beginning of the quarter, consumers can now record, share and enjoy their videos in Dolby Vision.
