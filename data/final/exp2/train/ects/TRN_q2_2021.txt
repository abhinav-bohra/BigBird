First, our second quarter revenue of $372 million was down 27% from a year ago, which was in line to slightly better than my expectations.
Our GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $0.12 compared to an adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.15, which includes a $0.03 adjustment primarily from the loss on extinguishment of our partially owned subsidiaries debt.

First, as you know, consumer confidence is very strong, and that activity has begun to ripple into our markets as we are seeing increasing railcar loads which are now running roughly 8% above 2020.
Railcars and storage declined 5% compared to a quarter ago, which has also been aided by strong scrapping market I mentioned.
As a result, our future lease rate differential or FLRD metric, which is the average of the rates transacted in the current quarter as compared to the average of the next 12 months expiring rates improved to a minus 2.5% compared to last quarter's minus 14.8%, continuing the recovery that we believe began in the third quarter of last year.

Over the last few years, our service capacity has increased from roughly 1/3 to over half of our maintenance events, achieving a target we set out at the end of 2018.
With our current footprint, we have the ability to get to 70%, which will continue to reduce the effective maintenance cost of our fleet and improve our railcar serviceability for our customers.
As a good indicator of our progress, year-to-date 2021, over 60% of our fleet maintenance spend was internal.
What is most exciting is what we are seeing in our orders, which totaled 4,570 in the quarter, up 224% compared to last quarter.
