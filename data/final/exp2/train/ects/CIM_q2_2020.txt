We issued a $374 million three-year convertible bond, we entered into a $400 million three-year revolving loan facility arranged by Ares Capital and we executed three new mortgage securitizations, totaling over $1 billion, which significantly reduced our loan warehouse exposure and helped reopen the mortgage securitization market, which is a primary source for Chimera's long-term financing.
We now have approximately 75% of our credit borrowings on longer-term facilities and over 50% of them have no mark-to-market or limited mark-to-market arrangements.
The 10-year treasury yield is now roughly 55 basis points and a rate on a new 30-year mortgage dipped below 3% for the first time in history.
During the quarter, we focused on the liability side of our balance sheet and entered into three non-mark-to-market facilities to finance $2 billion of our non-agency portfolio.
In addition, we have limited mark-to-market on $611 million of non-agency securities.
As a result of these transactions, approximately 54% of our non-agency borrowings are not subject to full mark-to-market risk.
