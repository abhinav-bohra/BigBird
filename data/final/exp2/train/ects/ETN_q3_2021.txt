And as you can see, we posted an all-time record for adjusted earnings per share of $1.75.
Supply chain constraints did have an impact on our revenue, but we still posted 8% growth in the quarter.
And for the third quarter in a row, we delivered record segment margins at 19.9% in Q3.
It was an all-time record and an increase of 230 basis points over prior year.
On top of record margins, we're also pleased with our incremental margins, which were 46% in the quarter, due to actions that we took to mitigate inflationary costs, the portfolio changes that we have undertaken, and savings from restructuring programs.
For the Electrical businesses overall, orders were up 17% on a rolling 12-month basis, and our backlog was up more than 50%, another all-time record.
First, on 9% revenue growth, we increased our operating profit by 23%, which reflects strong operating leverage and benefits from our portfolio actions.
Second, our acquisitions increased revenues by 7%, which was fully offset by the sale of Hydraulics.
And last, our margins of 19.9% were well above our guidance range of 19% to 19.4% as our team did an outstanding job of executing despite the lower-than-expected revenues.
Revenues were up 9%, including 1% organic and 8% from the acquisition of Tripp Lite.
Operating margins continue to be strong at 21.7% and were up 40 basis points from Q2.

Revenues were up 38%; 4% organic and 33% from the acquisition of Cobham Mission Systems and 1% from currency.
Operating margins were 22%, up 350 basis points from last year and 100 basis points sequentially.
This strong performance gives us confidence that as aerospace markets continue to recover, we'll meet or exceed the 24% margin targets that have been set for this segment.
On a rolling 12-month basis, orders were up 4%, primarily with strength in the business segment and our backlog has increased by 5%.
Organic revenues increased 11% with solid growth in North America Class A truck business and strength in South America that more than offset the weakness in North America light vehicle markets.
Operating margins were 18% and we generated very strong incremental margins of more than 50%.
Specifically of note, North America, the truck business benefited from strong aftermarket, where sales were up some 40% and attractive aftermarket margins.
You'll see the financial results of our eMobility segment, where revenues increased 6% organically.
Operating margins were a negative 9.5%, once again due to heavy R&D investments and start-up costs associated with new programs.
We continue to be pleased with the progress in this business, which is one program is worth nearly $600 million of mature year revenue.
And we expect to see a significant ramp up in revenues in 2023, which positions us well to achieve our long-term revenue target of $2 billion to $4 billion by 2030.
On page 10, we provide an update at our organic growth and operating margins for the year.
With supply chain constraints in Q3 continuing into Q4, we now expect overall organic revenue growth of 9% to 11% for 2021.
For Electrical Americas, we expect 5% to 7% growth.
And you'll note the implied guidance for Q4 is actually 7% to 9%, which is a solid step-up from the 1% in Q3.
Despite slightly lower organic revenue growth outlook, we're increasing our operating margin guidance by 20 basis points from 18.6% to 19%.
And I'd note that with this guidance, we're on track to generate strong incremental margins of approximately 40% for 2021, which we see naturally is outstanding performance given the current inflationary environment.
Moving to page 11.
We expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $6.59 to $6.69.
At the midpoint, this represents 35% growth over 2020.
We're also delivering significant margin improvement, up 240 basis points from last year at the midpoint of our increased margin guidance.
Next, given more active M&A activities, we now expect share repurchase to be between $375 million and $425 million.
And lastly, our Q4 guidance includes earnings between $1.68 and $1.78, organic revenue growth between 7% and 9%, and segment margins between 18.8% and 19.2%, an increase of 160 basis points at the midpoint versus prior year.
Next, on page 12, we did want to provide some preliminary assumptions for our end markets for 2022.
And lastly, on page 13, we provide just some summary thoughts here.
And with strong year-to-date performance, we're well on our track to deliver a very strong 2021 with double-digit organic revenue growth and 35% adjusted earnings per share growth.
And you'll recall that at the beginning of the year, we set medium-term targets of 4% to 6% organic revenue growth annually, 400 to 500 basis points improvement in margins and 11% to 13% annual growth in adjusted EPS.
