I'm extremely pleased with where we stand today by having nearly $700 million of dry powder at our disposal between cash on hand and available credit capacity, while carrying a modest leverage ratio of 0.92.
I wish I could tell you that we saw this economic prices coming late in 2019 when we extended our five-year credit facility out to the year 2024 and we increased our debt capacity by an additional $50 million at lower rates, or when we sold the Technical Packaging business and generated over $190 million of gross proceeds to significantly improve our cash and debt positions, but we didn't see it coming.
Sales increased 5%, led by our Aerospace & Defense segment growing $16 million or 20% driven by the addition of Globe's submarine businesses, coupled with strong aerospace sales at PTI and Crissair, and higher space sales at VACCO.
Q2 A&D sales came in approximately $3 million ahead of plan.
Entered orders clearly were a bright spot in both Q2 and year-to-date, where we booked $466 million of new business and ended March with a record backlog of $565 million, which is up 25% from the start of the year.
During Q2, we generated $34 million of cash from continuing operations with free cash flow of $23 million, which is 127% free cash flow conversion to net earnings during the quarter.
Q2 and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA improved from prior year, with Q2 reflecting a 17.4% margin despite the lower contribution from USG, which is our highest margin segment.
And finally, Q2 adjusted earnings per share was $0.68 a share, down slightly from the $0.71 a share delivered in Q2 of 2019, which resulted from the noted COVID impact.
