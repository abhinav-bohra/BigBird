I'll begin with the first quarter results for our unallocated items as summarized on page 13.
First quarter adjusted EBITDA for this segment improved by $7 million compared to fourth quarter 2020.
Turning now to our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 14 cash from operations totaled nearly $700 million for the first quarter.
This is our highest quarterly operating cash flow since fourth quarter 2006, and our highest first quarter cash flow on record.
However, operating cash flow improved by over $250 million compared with the fourth quarter, as these factors were more than outweighed by higher pricing for lumber and oriented strand board.
We reinvested a portion of this cash in our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $53 million for the first quarter.
Adjusted funds available for distribution or FAD, for first quarter 2021, totaled $645 million as highlighted on Page 15.
In the first quarter, we returned $127 million to our shareholders through payment of our first-quarter base dividend of $0.17 per share.
As a reminder, we plan to target a total annual return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD.
We will deploy the remaining 20% to 25% of our annual FAD consistent with our stated priorities for opportunistic capital allocation.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended our first quarter with over $1 billion of cash, an undrawn line of credit, and just under $5.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt.
As a reminder, we have cash earmarked to repay our $150 million 9% note, when it matures in the fourth quarter.
Our strong balance sheet position, in addition to our record EBITDA performance, has resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5 times.
Although our leverage ratio is significantly below our over the cycle target of 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA, we believe that's appropriate given the extremely strong commodity markets we're experiencing today.
Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on page 16.
In the second quarter, we will report a cash outflow of approximately $149 million for the 69,000 acre Alabama Timberlands acquisition that we completed this week.

For OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.
Additionally, in March 2021, we announced a third increase, which ranges from 10% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters.
We continue to expect full year 2021 interest expense will be approximately $315 million.
