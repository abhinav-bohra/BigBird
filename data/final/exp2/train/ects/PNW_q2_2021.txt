It will also be available by telephone through August 12, 2021.
We also successfully navigated through an early summer heatwave that resulted in six consecutive days of at least 115 degrees and three days approaching our all-time peak demand.
In a five-day period during mid-July, our teams restored power to more than 120,000 customers affected by storm-related outages and we effectively communicated with our customers regarding outage status and expected service restoration times.
From that you can see that the administrative law judge recommended a $3.6 million revenue increase or a non-fuel $29 million revenue decrease at 9.16% return on equity and implied 0.05% return on fair value.
On the ESG front, in May, the commission voted to preliminarily approve new clean energy rules that would provide for a final standard of 100% clean energy by 2070 with interim standards, the first of which requires a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by December of 2032.
We think we're well-aligned with the commission on the interim goals and expect to continue our current path to achieve 100% clean energy by 2050.
We've executed a contract for an additional 60 megawatts of utility-owned energy storage to be located in our APS solar sites.
In addition, we're working through our current all-source RFP for 600 megawatts to 800 megawatts of additional resources with decisions from that RFP expected in the third quarter of this year.
Our performance in the second quarter remains strong earning $1.91 per share compared to $1.71 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
We experienced 2.3% customer growth and 5.7% weather normalized sales growth during the second quarter compared to the same period in 2020.
Residential sales increased 1.3% and commercial and industrial sales increased 10.3% compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Given the strong rebound in C&I sales and continued residential strength, we are increasing our 2021 sales estimate to 1% to 2% growth from our previous estimate of 0.5% to 1.5% growth.
For 2021 through the end of May employment in Metro Phoenix increased 1% compared to 2.2% increase in the entire US.
To be clear, that's 1% Metro Phoenix compared to 0.2% increase in the entire US.
As a result of this continued strong population growth, Arizona reached the highest level of residential housing permits since 2006 last year.
This year, through May, Maricopa County has already reached 21,000 housing permits, which puts housing permits on pace to exceed last year.
For perspective, the general rule of thumb is that every 50 basis point reduction in ROE equates to approximately $32 million in revenue requirement.
Regarding the potential impact from the recommendation to deny Four Corners of the -- to deny recovery of Four Corners SCR investment and deferral, as of June 30, 2021, the SCR deferral balance was approximately $75 million and the net book value of the asset was approximately $320 million net of accumulated deferred income taxes.
If the commission denies recovery of the deferral, it would likely result in a write-off of approximately $75 million, which is net of accumulated deferred income tax.
In summary, we estimate the ROO, if approved, could decrease annual net income up to about $90 million, which includes the non-fuel decrease as well as the effects of incremental costs we incur once rates become effective.
Regarding our financing plans, we expect to issue up to $500 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2020 to fund capital investments.
