Since the nationwide rollout in June, we have facilitated over 60,000 commercial transactions.
A digital start-up that we've launched in Seattle in 2019 to reimagine the closing experience has captured a 2% market share in that area.
Encouraged by our success, we've recently entered six new markets, and we plan on growing to 20 markets by the end of the year.
In 2020, our data business exceeded $100 million of pre-tax earnings, a significant milestone.
We currently hold 11 patents covering OCR and data extraction, which has facilitated us to caption over 60% of our data in a fully automated manner.
We are currently capturing virtually every data point on 5 million documents per month.
Today, we have 500 title plants, which is the largest data repository in the industry to support title underwriting decisions.
Because of our patent extraction process, we have started the journey to add an additional 1,000 title plants on a go-forward basis.
Today, 96% of our Company's refinance transactions run through our automated underwriting engine.
Based on our own risk profile, we've achieved a fully automated underwriting decision on 50% of those orders, and we are semi-automated on additional 40%.

We earned $2.10 per diluted share.
Included in this quarter's results were $0.46 of net realized investment gains.
Excluding these gains, we earned $1.64 per diluted share.
Revenue in our Title segment was $1.9 billion, up 45% compared with the same quarter of 2020.
Purchase revenue was up 27%, driven by a 15% increase in the number of closed orders, coupled with an 11% increase in the average revenue per order.
Refinance revenue climbed at 79% relative to last year and was flat relative to the fourth quarter, as refinance closings continued to be elevated as a result of low mortgage rates.
Commercial revenue was $163 million, a 2% increase over last year.
On the agency side, revenue was a record $845 million, up 41% from last year.
Our information and other revenues were $275 million, up 32% relative to last year.
The largest component of information and other is revenue from our data and analytics business, which totaled $89 million, a 17% increase from last year.
Investment income within the Title Insurance and Services segment was $43 million, down 29%, primarily due to the impact of the decline in short-term interest rates on the investment portfolio and cash balances, partially offset by higher interest income from the Company's warehouse lending business.
In our Title segment, pre-tax margin was 17.1%.
Excluding the impact of net realized investment gains, pre-tax margin was 14.1%, a record for the first quarter.
I'll note that we've lowered the loss rate 100 basis points to 4% this quarter.
By booking at 5% in 2020, we added $52 million to our IBNR.
Pretax earnings totaled $6 million, down from $13 million in 2020.

Turning to capital management, we repurchased $65 million of stock at an average price of $52.86 during the quarter.
Since March of 2020, we've repurchased $203 million of stock, which is close to the amount of our annual dividend to stockholders.
As Dennis mentioned in his remarks, we've invested a total of $225 million in venture-backed companies.
Our largest investment was in OfferPad, an iBuyer that is now party to a merger with Supernova Partners Acquisition Company, who last month announced that the value of the aggregate equity consideration to be paid to OfferPad's stockholders and option holders will be equal to $2.25 billion.
If the transaction is consummated at that valuation, we would expect to book a gain later this year of approximately $237 million on our $85 million investment.
Additionally, this quarter, we recorded $42 million of gains related to other venture investments, including in Side [Phonetic] a real estate SaaS company that serves high-performing agents, teams and brokers.
