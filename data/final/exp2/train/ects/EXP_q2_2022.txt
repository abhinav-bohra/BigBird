You can see in this quarter, we purchased approximately $185 million of Eagle stock.
As for Wallboard, pricing is most strongly driven by demand, and demand has been strong as evidenced by our 33% year-on-year increase in Wallboard prices.
We are currently hedged for approximately 50% of our natural gas needs through the remainder of our fiscal year at slightly under [$4 per million], which should help us manage our cost swings.

And adjusting for our refinancing actions during the quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $2.73, a 26% improvement.
Revenue in the sector increased 5%, driven by the increase in cement sales prices and sales volume.
The price increases range from $6 to $8 per ton and were effective in most markets in early April.
Operating earnings increased 13%, reflecting higher cement prices and sales volumes as well as reduced maintenance costs.
Consistent with the comments we made in the first quarter, and because we shifted all of our planned cement maintenance outages to the first quarter, our second quarter maintenance costs were about $4 million less than what they were in the prior year.
Revenue in our Light Materials sector increased 28%, reflecting higher Wallboard sales volume prices.
Operating earnings in the sector increased 39% to $67 million, reflecting higher net sales prices, which helped offset higher input costs, mainly recycled fiber costs and energy.

Capital spending declined to $27 million.
