We did incur direct costs of about $7.5 million related to these actions to protect our employees from COVID.
We finished the year strong with a combined EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA of $214.5 million in fourth quarter.
All of our segments in the Global Ingredients platform put up solid results as the $146.3 million of EBITDA in the base business was the best quarterly performance of 2020 and reflected the growing momentum of an improved pricing cycle.
The Feed segment ended the year with a solid performance of $90.2 million of EBITDA, driven by the higher raw material volumes and better prices in both proteins and fats for the quarter.
Our collagen peptide sales drove better results posting approximately $50 million of EBITDA for the fourth quarter.
Now, as we had indicated on our third quarter call, Diamond Green Diesel had its turnaround in early fourth quarter, which led to DGD selling approximately 57 million gallons of renewable diesel at $2.40 per gallon or contributing $68.2 million of EBITDA to Darling during the fourth quarter.
For the year, DGD certainly met our expectations, selling 288 million gallons of renewable diesel at an average of $2.34 per gallon.
Darling's share of EBITDA from DGD for 2020 was $337.3 million.
The previously mentioned pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charge of $38.2 million related to the shutdown of the two biodiesel facilities included a goodwill impairment charge of $31.6 million, other long-lived asset charges of $6.2 million and $0.4 million of restructuring charges.
Now, for a few of the highlights; net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $44.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to a net income of $242.6 million or $1.44 per diluted share for the 2019 fourth quarter.
Net income for fiscal 2020 was $296.8 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared to $312.6 million or $1.86 per diluted share for fiscal 2019.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a 30.6 million after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charge related to the shutdown of our Canada and U.S. biodiesel facilities.
Excluding this charge, adjusted net income was $75.3 million or $0.45 per diluted share.
Excluding these credits for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2019 resulted in an adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 of $50.1 million or $0.30 per diluted share.
Excluding the restructuring and asset impairment charge related to the shutdown of the two biodiesel facilities adjusted net income for fiscal 2020 was $327.4 million or $1.96 per diluted share.
Excluding the retroactive blenders tax credits related to 2018 adjusted net income for fiscal 2019 was $226 million or $1.34 per diluted share.
Now, turning to our operating income, we recorded $74.4 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $293.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.
Excluding the pre-tax $38.2 million restructuring and asset impairment charge adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $112.5 million.
Excluding the retroactively reinstated blenders tax credits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 for prior periods, the adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $100 million.
Therefore, on a comparative basis the fourth quarter of 2020 adjusted operating income improved $12.5 million over the fourth quarter of 2019.
The fourth quarter 2020 gross margin increased $29.8 million over the prior year amount, which partially offset the $38.2 million impairment charge and a $10 million increase in depreciation and amortization, which was partially attributable to the Belgium Group and Marengo acquisition assets added in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Operating income for fiscal 2020 was $430.9 million as compared to $475.8 million for fiscal 2019.
Excluding the $38.2 million restructuring and impairment charge, the adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 was $469.1 million.
Operating income for fiscal 2019 was $475.8 million.
Excluding the retroactive blenders tax credits related to 2018 adjusted operating income for fiscal 2019 was $389.2 million.
The $79.9 million increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a gross margin increase of $108.3 million and a larger contribution and equity earnings from our renewable diesel joint venture Diamond Green Diesel.
These improvements more than offset a $20 million increase in SG&A, asset sales gains of $20.6 million in fiscal 2019 and a $24.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization.
SG&A increased $20 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to increases in insurance premiums, labor cost, COVID-related costs and foreign currency effect, which were partially offset by lower travel cost.
Interest expense declined $1.7 million for the fourth quarter 2020 as compared to the 2019 fourth quarter amount and declined $6 million for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.
Turning to income taxes, the company's 2020 effective tax rate of 15.1% is lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the biofuel tax incentives.
Tax expense and cash tax payments for 2020 were $53.3 million and $36.8 million respectively.
For 2021 we are projecting the effective tax rate to be 20% and cash taxes of approximately $40 million.
Looking at the balance sheet at year-end January 2, 2021 debt was reduced $141.4 million during the year with a net paydown of $189.8 million.
The bank covenant leverage ratio ended the year at 1.90.
Capital expenditures totaled $280.1 million for 2020 as we plan to spend approximately $312 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2021.
The company received $205.2 million in cash distributions in 2020 from our Diamond Green Diesel joint venture.
Lastly, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock totaling $55 million during fiscal 2020 and paid approximately $29.8 million in cash in the fourth quarter of 2020 for the Belgium Group and Marengo acquisitions.
Now diving into 2021, with the commodity price improvement and continued strong raw material volumes, we believe that our Food, Feed and Fuel segments prior to adding Diamond Green Diesel should generate between $565 million and $600 million of EBITDA.
That's a conservative 12% to 20% improvement over 2020.
DGD, we believe will be able to earn at least $2.25 a gallon EBITDA in 2021 and should produce between 300 million gallons and 310 million gallons this year, which would generate between $335 million and $350 million of EBITDA for Darling share.
This range does not include any additional upside for renewable diesel gallons that could be produced in 2021 as the 400 million gallon expansion is on track to commission in early Q4.
This 470 million gallon renewable diesel facility should be operational by the back half of 2023 securing Diamond Green Diesel's leadership position as the largest low-cost producer of renewable diesel in North America.
Darling believes there's adequate low carbon feedstocks to supply the 1.2 billion gallon renewable diesel platform of DGD.
