Revenue of $3.5 billion was the highest quarterly revenue in our company's history.
Revenue increased more than $500 million or 17% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share grew 40%.
This demand, combined with our organizational focus on delivering broader value to our clients, was also reflected in a very strong cross-sales, driving our largest revenue synergy quarter-to-date, increasing our run rate by 50% or $150 million sequentially to $450 million.
This sales execution in turn drove a $1.5 billion increase to our backlog, which is now greater than $22 billion.
Our strong execution is driving us to raise both our 2021 guidance and increase our year-end revenue synergy target to $700 million.
In addition, as we consider client demand across our portfolio of solutions, we are extending our mid-term outlook of 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024.
T. Rowe Price provides yet another example of an industry leader looking to FIS to help them modernize their 401(k) retirement offering with advanced technology.
In other retail locations where we have rolled out the solution, we are seeing consumers accept premium paybacks offered to pay with points approximately 50% of the time when they are prompted.
The revenue contribution from solutions developed over the past three years continues to grow as a percent of our total revenue mix, up from less than 1% in 2019 to over 4% in 2021.
New solutions also contribute meaningfully to our total revenue growth, with contribution increasing from less than 1% in 2019 to more than 2% in total revenue growth in 2021.
Looking forward, we expect new solutions to drive up to 3 points of incremental growth each year, supporting our outlook for 7% to 9% revenue growth through the midterm.
It's why we are confident in our forward momentum to drive strong 7% to 9% revenue growth through 2024.
On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 17% to $3.5 billion, driven by outperformance in each of our operating segments.
Organic revenue growth was 16%.
Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 460 basis points to 44%, reflecting strong operating leverage and synergy contribution.
As a result, adjusted earnings per share increased 40% year-over-year to $1.61 per share.
Given our progress and strength of our pipeline, we are increasing our revenue synergy target for 2021 by $100 million to exit the year at $700 million on an annualized run rate basis.
We have more than doubled our initial cost synergy target of $400 million and are on-track to exit the year with approximately $900 million in total annualized savings, including approximately $500 million in operating expense synergies.
We repurchased 2.7 million shares worth approximately $400 million during the quarter, bringing share repurchase to a total of $800 million year-to-date at an average price of $145 a share.
Our leverage ratio declined to 3.3 times, keeping us on-track to end the year below 3 times leverage.
Lastly, we generated free cash flow in excess of $1 billion this quarter, which is the most in our company's history and reflects the highly cash generative nature of our business.
Banking revenue growth accelerated to 8% due in part to strong issuer processing growth of 17% and a 30% increase in Modern Banking platform revenue.
As Gary noted, we had another 2 MBP wins this quarter as well as an add-on sale and MBP revenue will continue to accelerate as more clients go live.
We currently expect MBP revenue growth of nearly 50% for the full year 2021 and for this to further accelerate into 2022.
The Banking segment's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 410 basis points to 46%.
Capital markets revenue growth also accelerated to 6% this quarter, reflecting strong recurring revenue growth and sales execution.
Capital Markets adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points to 46%.
Lastly, for Merchant, revenue growth rebounded sharply to 45% in the second quarter, which includes 10 points of yield benefit and the segment generated its largest new sales quarter in the history of the business.
Merchants' revenue acceleration included 31% revenue growth in e-commerce.
Merchants adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 910 basis points to 50%, primarily reflecting its high contribution margin and synergy benefits.
We now anticipate revenue of $13.9 billion to $14 billion for the full year 2021, which represents an increase of $250 million over our prior guidance.
We now expect Merchant growth to approach 20% this year, ahead of our initial expectations.
Relative to 2019, Merchant revenue growth accelerated 9% in the second quarter or 12% in the U.S.
We're also raising our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $6.125 billion to $6.2 billion and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $6.45 to $6.60 per share.
For the third quarter, we expect 9% to 10% revenue growth and to generate revenue of $3.49 billion to $3.52 billion.
As a result of the high contribution margins in our business, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand more than 50 basis points sequentially or about 200 basis points year-over-year to approximately 44% for the third quarter.
This will result in adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 to $1.69 in the first year.
Beyond our guidance for the year, we expect to generate 7% to 9% revenue growth in the midterm through 2024, as Gary discussed.
Second, strong new sales and cross-selling activity drove our backlog above $22 billion and increased our revenue synergy attainment by 50% in just one quarter, which will continue to drive future growth into 2022 and beyond.
