Overall, we are pleased with the start of the year as adjusted revenues for the quarter increased 29% and adjusted EBITDA increased 37%.
Organic constant-currency revenues increased 1.3% as strength in international was partially offset by the final quarter of COVID-19 headwinds and Data.com in North America.
Total company revenue retention was 96.3% and we now have approximately 48% of our business under multiyear contracts.
As we reach the two-year anniversary of our cost savings program, we finished the quarter with $246 million of annualized run-rate cost savings.
Despite COVID-19 delaying some of our planned cost savings initiatives, we exceeded our original target by 23%, which ultimately contributed to the expansion of adjusted EBITDA margins by over 800 basis points from when we took the company private.
We're pleased with the ongoing success we're having with our strategic clients as they renew near 100%, while continuing to expand their relationships with us.
In the first quarter, we rolled out a Global 500 account program simultaneously with the close of Bisnode, prioritizing the most strategic accounts.
Our U.K. team is working with Generali, a Global 500 global insurance and asset management provider with a leading position in Europe and a growing presence in Asia and Latin America, to help them identify ways to improve consistency of screening across their global, corporate, and commercial businesses, as well as reduce risk.
Another Global 500 company, Linde Region Europe North, member of Linde PLC, is a leading global industrial gas and engineering company that wanted to improve their credit checks and risk monitoring of B2B customers in a more data-driven way.
Today, we have 22 partner datasets, including healthcare reference data from IQVIA and commercial fleet data from IHS Markit, and we're adding more partners monthly.
While inside the portal, we offer personalized offerings of our and our partner's solutions, which has already resulted in a 60% increase in cross-sells during the first quarter.
