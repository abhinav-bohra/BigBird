The world has two challenges to grow our global energy supply by about 20% in the next 20 years and to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
Our reasonable estimate for global oil and gas investment from these IEA scenarios is at least $400 billion each year over the next 10 years.
Last year, that number was $300 billion.
This year's estimate is $340 billion.
Based upon the most recent sell side consensus estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 50% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500.
As of September the 30th, we had $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet.

This debt reduction combined with the start up of lease of Phase 2 early next year, is expected to drive our debt to EBITDAX ratio under 2% and also enable us to consider increasing cash returns to shareholders.
In August, we completed the sale of our interest in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million effective January 1, 2021, and received $375 million in proceeds from Hess Midstream's buyback of Class B units from its sponsors Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners.

In Southeast Asia, net production in the third quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in line with our guidance of 50, 000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns and lower nominations due to COVID.
Fourth quarter net production is forecast to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our full year 2021 net production forecast remains at approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
