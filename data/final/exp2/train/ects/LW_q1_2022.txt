Overall, restaurant traffic has largely stabilized at about 5% below pre-pandemic levels led by the continued solid performance at quick service restaurants.
Demand in U.S. retail channels also remained solid with overall category volumes in the quarter still up 15% to 20% from pre-pandemic levels.
Specifically in the quarter, sales increased 13% to $984 million, with volume up 11% and price mix up 2%.
Overall, our sales volume in the first quarter was about 95% of what it was during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 before the pandemic impacted demand.
Gross profit in the quarter declined $63 million, as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher manufacturing and transportation costs on a per pound basis.
The decline in gross profit also includes the $6 million decrease in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, which includes a $1 million gain in the current quarter compared with a $7 million gain in the prior year quarter.
Moving on from cost of sales; our SG&A increased $13 million in the quarter.
About $4 million this quarter represents non-recurring ERP related expenses.
And third, it includes an additional $3 million of advertising and promotional support behind the launch of new branded items in our retail segment.
Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.20, down from $0.61 in the prior year, while adjusted EBITDA including joint ventures was $123 million, down from $202 million.
Moving to our segments, sales for our Global segment were up 12% in the quarter with volume up 10% and price mix up 2%.
The 2% increase in price mix reflected the benefit of higher prices charged for freight, inflation driven price escalators and favorable customer mix.
Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses declined 45% to $43 million.
Moving to our Foodservice segment, sales increased 36% with volume up 35% and price mix up 1%.
Overall non-commercial shipments were up sequentially to 75% to 80% to pre-pandemic levels from about 65% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
Foodservices product contribution margin rose 12% to $96 million.
Moving to our Retail segments; sales declined 14% with volume down 15% and price mix up 1%.
Retails product contribution margin declined 59% to $15 million.
Input and transportation cost inflation, higher manufacturing cost per pound, lower sales volumes and a $2 million increase in A&P expenses to support the launch of new products drove the decline.
In the first quarter, we generated more than $160 million of cash from operations.
That's down about $90 million versus the prior year quarter due primarily to lower earnings.
We spent nearly $80 million in capital expenditures and paid $34 million in dividends.
We also bought back nearly $26 million worth of stock or about double what we have typically repurchased in prior quarters.
During the quarter, we amended our revolver to increase its capacity from $750 million to $1 billion and extended its maturity date to August 2026.
At the end of the first quarter, our revolver was undrawn and we had nearly $790 million of cash on hand.
Our total debt was about $2.75 billion and our net-debt-to-EBITDA including joint ventures ratio was 2.7 times.
We expect price mix will be up sequentially versus the 2% that we delivered in Q1 as the execution of pricing actions in all of our segments remain on track.
For the full year, we expect our gross margin may be at least 5 points to 8 points below our normalized annual margin rate of 25% to 26%.
First, we've reduced our capital expenditure estimate to $450 million from our previous estimate of $650 million to $700 million.
And second, we're reducing our estimated full year effective tax rate to approximately 22%, down from our previous estimate of between 23% and 24%.
