In summary, for the second quarter, though our sales were down, selling prices and overall mix of sales remain good, factory performance was improved compared to 2019 and gross margins as a percentage of sales increased from 37% to 39%.

This includes about $5 million of inventory related to acquisitions completed since June 30, 2019.
