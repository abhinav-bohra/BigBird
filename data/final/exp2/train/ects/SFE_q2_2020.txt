We are currently running at mid-$5 million a year to operate with corporate expenses down 36% year-on-year.
On the capital front, we believe we currently have sufficient funds to operate and support the expected needs of our companies over the next 12 months.
We selected five companies that are among the top 10 in expected exit values.
To be clear, these are not necessarily the top 5 positions in exit value, but they are among the top 10.
You heard about meQuilibrium on our webinar, so I won't go into too much detail, but meQuilibrium stock falls in our revenue bucket of $5 million to $10 million with SaaS talent development solution using predictive analytics to support resilient, engaged and agile workforce.
Company also closed a $4 million Series C extension funding.
Prognos falls in our $15 million to $20 million revenue bucket.
Zipnosis falls in the $5 million to $10 million revenue bucket.
Clutch falls in the $10 million to $15 million revenue bucket.
In Q2, [Indecipherable] COVID-19 plan, they won two new strategic accounts and they have achieved SOC 2 compliance and completed a new release of the platform.
Flashtalking is the above $20 million revenue bucket.
They successfully rolled out the first of 14 countries for Procter & Gamble, a large new customer.
So we hope this helps frame our thinking on some of the companies, what we plan to do is, next quarter we will review the other five companies which sit within the top 10, and estimated exit values to provide you some greater insight into how we're thinking about the companies and what we like about these opportunities as well as how they're performing in the current quarter or, in this case, we'll be choosing Q3 highlights.
For the quarter ended June 30th, 2020, Safeguard's net loss was $9.9 million or $0.48 per share compared with a net income of $36.1 million or $1.75 per share for the same period of 2019.
Safeguard's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at June 30th totaled $13.6 million, and we have no debt obligations.
Our funding to existing ownership interest continued this quarter, including $3.8 million to Syapse, which resulted in $4.4 million during the year-to-date period with the Syapse [Phonetic] after considering bridge loans during the first quarter.
We made two other small deployments during the quarter, and we continue to expect that deployments for the full year of 2020 will be between $8 million to $12 million.
The quarter's results also included impairments of $5.7 million related to the lowering of our estimate of fair value for our ownership interest in Sonobi, T-Rex, Beta and in other ownership interest.
Our general and administrative expenses were $2 million for the three months ended June 30th, 2020 as compared to $2.6 million in the second quarter of 2019.
Corporate expenses for the second quarter, which represent general and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, severance and retirement costs and other non-recurring or other items, were $1.2 million as compared to $1.9 million in 2019.
So approximately $0.1 million of the decline is attributable to this catch-up of the first quarter's portion.
As a result, we expect that our corporate expenses for the full year of 2020 will be at the low-end or below our previously disclosed range of $5.6 million to $6.0 million as compared to $7.1 million reported for the full year of 2019.
With respect to ownership interests at June 30th, 2020, we have an aggregate carrying value of $61.4 million.
Our share of the losses of our equity method ownership interest for the three months ended June 30th, 2020 was $3.1 million as compared to $8.3 million for the comparable period in 2019.
