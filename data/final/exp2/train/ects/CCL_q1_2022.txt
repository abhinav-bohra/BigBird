During the first quarter 2022, we restarted 10 additional ships, resulting in 60% of our fleet capacity in guest cruise operations for the whole of the first quarter.
This was a substantial increase from 47% during the fourth quarter 2021.
As of today, 75% of our fleet capacity has resumed guest cruise operations.
For the first quarter, occupancy was 54% across the ships in service.
However, we had anticipated first quarter occupancy would exceed the 58% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.
We started the quarter with over 55% cabin occupancy booked for the first quarter and expected to improve upon that during the quarter.
All of this inhibited our ability to build on our cabin occupancy book position for the first quarter 2022 during the first quarter, resulting in occupancy for the first quarter 2022 at 54% being lower than the 58% occupancy we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Despite all that, during the first quarter, we carried over one million guests, which was nearly a 20% increase from the fourth quarter 2021.
Revenue per passenger day for the first quarter 2022 increased approximately 7.5% compared to a strong 2019 despite our lucrative world cruises and exotic voyages being shelved this year.
Over the past 2.5 years, we have offered and our guests have chosen more and more bundled package options.
On the cost side, our adjusted cruise cost without fuel per available lower berth day, or ALBD as it is more commonly called, for the first quarter 2022 was up 25%.
The increase in adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD is driven essentially by five things: first, the cost of a portion of the fleet being in pause status; second, restart related expenses; third, 15 ships being in dry dock during the quarter, which resulted in nearly double the number of dry dock days during the first quarter versus the first quarter 2019; fourth, the cost of maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols; and finally, inflation.
We ended the first quarter 2022 with $7.2 billion in liquidity versus $9.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
The change in liquidity during the quarter was driven essentially by four things: first, an improved negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion due to our ongoing resumption of guest cruise operations despite the impact of the omicron variant.
Second, our investment of $400 million in capital expenditures net of export credits.
Third, $500 million of debt principal payments.
And fourth, $400 million of interest expense during the quarter.
However, as I've already said, adjusted EBITDA over the first half of 2022 has been or will be impacted by the restart-related spending and dry dock expenses as 39 ships, over 40% of our fleet, will have been in dry dock during the first half of fiscal 2022.
Looking to brighter days ahead in 2023, with the full fleet back in service all year, 8% more capacity than 2019 and improved fleet profile with nearly a quarter of our capacity consisting of newly delivered ships, continuing momentum on our outstanding Net Promoter Scores and occupancy returning to historical levels, we are looking forward to providing memorable vacation experiences to nearly 14 million guests and generating potentially greater adjusted EBITDA than 2019.
