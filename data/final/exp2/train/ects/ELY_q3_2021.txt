1 position year to date.
Moving to Slides 12 and 13.
Consolidated net revenue for the quarter was $856 million, an increase of 80% or $381 million compared to Q3 2020.
The increase was led by the addition of Topgolf revenue of $334 million, along with an 8.4% increase in golf equipment revenue and an 11.9% increase in apparel, gear, and other.
Changes in foreign currency rates had a $4 million favorable impact on third quarter 2021 revenues.
Total cost and expenses were $772 million on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $406 million in the third quarter of 2020.
Of the 366 million increase, Topgolf added $310 million of total costs and expenses.
The remaining $56 million increase includes moving spending levels back to normal levels, the start-up of the new Korean Callaway apparel business and expansion of the TravisMathew business, increase corporate structure -- increase corporate costs to support a larger organization, and increase freight costs and inflationary pressures.
We are also reporting for the third quarter of 2021, non-GAAP operating income of $85 million, a $15 million increase over the same period in 2020.
The increase was led by a $24 million increase in segment profit due to the addition of the Topgolf business, and a $9 million increase in apparel, gear, and other operating income, partially offset by $11 million decrease in golf equipment operating income due to increased freight costs and return to more normalized spend.
Non-GAAP other expense was $22 million in the third quarter compared to other expense of 3 million in Q3 2020.
The $19 million increase was primarily related to a $16 million increase in interest expense related to the addition of Topgolf, as well as lower hedge gains, compared to the prior period.
On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate for the third quarter was an unusual 132%.
On a nine-month GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 22%.
Excluding the valuation allowance we recorded again and the impact of the other nonrecurring items, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 58% and for the nine months was 29%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.14 or an approximately 194 million shares in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $0.61 per share on approximately 97 million shares in the third quarter of 2020.

Lastly, adjusted EBITDA was $139 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $88 million in the third quarter of 2020.
The $51 million increase was driven by a $59 million contribution for the Topgolf business, which performed exceptionally well this quarter and was partially offset by a return toward more normal spend levels in the golf equipment and soft goods businesses.

Consolidated net accounts receivable was $255 million, an increase of 6%, compared to $240 million at the end of the third quarter of 2020.
This increase is primarily attributable to the increase in third quarter revenue, as well as an incremental $10 million of Topgolf accounts receivable.
Legacy days sales outstanding decreased to 53 days as of September 30, 2021, compared to 55 days as of September 30, 2020.
Our inventory balance increased to $385 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021, compared to $325 million at the end of the third quarter of the prior year.
This $60 million increase was due to higher golf equipment inventory, especially toward the end of the quarter, reflecting an increase in in-transit inventory and a shift to making '22 launch product.
The Topgolf business also added $18 million to total inventory this quarter.
Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2021 were $149 million, net of expected REIT reimbursements.
This includes $109 million related to Topgolf.
From a full year 2021 forecast perspective, the golf equipment and soft goods business forecast is $60 million.
The 2021 full year forecast for Callaway and Topgolf is approximately $225 million, net of REIT reimbursements, primarily related to the new venue openings.
The foregoing amounts do not include approximately 33 million in capital expenditures for Topgolf in January and February, which was premerger.
Non-GAAP depreciation and amortization expense was $37 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $8 million in 2020.
This includes $28 million of non-GAAP depreciation and amortization related to Topgolf.
For the full year 2021, we expect non-GAAP depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $130 million, which includes $93 million for the Topgolf business.
The foregoing does not include approximately 18 million of Topgolf non-GAAP depreciation and amortization from January and February in the aggregate.
For the full year, we expect revenue to range between 3.11 and $3.12 billion.
That compares to 1.59 billion in 2020 and 1.70 billion in 2019.
It also assumes continued strong momentum in the Topgolf business, which is expected to generate 10-month segment revenue that will come in slightly above its 2019 full 12-month revenue of $1.06 billion.
Full year adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between 424 and $430 million, which assumes approximately 158 million from Topgolf.
For the fourth quarter, our implied revenue guidance is increasing by approximately 30 million, with about 50% of that flowing through to adjusted EBITDA.
