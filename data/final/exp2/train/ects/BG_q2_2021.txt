Taking into account our year-to-date results and based on what we can see now in the forward curves, we are increasing our outlook for the year and expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of at least $8.50 for the full year 2021.
So in our June 2020 business update, we outlined our earnings baseline of $5 per share.
With the changes we've made in our business as well as the fundamental shifts in the marketplace, we're taking that baseline earnings per share up to $7, and that's a $2 increase.
Our reported second quarter earnings per share was $2.37 compared to $3.47 in the second quarter of 2020.
Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.24 per share.
Adjusted earnings per share was $2.61 in the second quarter versus $1.88 in the prior year.
Adjusted Core segment earnings before interest and taxes for EBIT was $550 million in the quarter versus $564 million last year, reflecting lower results in Agribusiness partially offset by improved performances in Refined Specialty Oils and Milling.
Prior year results were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million in foreign exchange translation losses on U.S. dollar-denominated debt of the joint venture due to significant depreciation of the Brazilian real.
For the six months ended Q2, income tax expense was $242 million compared to an income tax expense of $113 million in the prior year.
Net interest expense of $48 million was below last year, primarily driven by lower average variable interest rates, partially offset by higher average debt levels due to increased working capital.
We have achieved underlying addressable SG&A savings of $20 million, of which approximately 80% is related to indirect costs.
For the most recent trailing 12-month period, our cash generation, excluding notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, was strong with approximately $2 billion of adjusted funds from operations.
This cash flow generation was well in excess of our cash obligations over the past 12 months, allowing us to strengthen our balance sheet.
Shortly after quarter end, we closed on the sale of our U.S. grain interior elevators, receiving additional cash proceeds of approximately $300 million and another $160 million for net working capital.
After allocating $76 million to sustaining capex, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety and $17 million to preferred dividends, we had approximately $800 million of discretionary cash flow available.
Of this amount, we paid $141 million in common dividends and invested $57 million in growth and productivity capex, leaving over $600 million of retained cash flow.
For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 18.4%, 11.8 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%.
ROIC was 13%, seven percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6% and well above our stated target of 9%.
For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion and a cash flow yield of nearly 24%.
As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account our strong Q2 results and our outlook, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share from $7.50 to at least $8.50, above last year's record of $8.30.
Additionally, the company expects the following for 2021: an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 17% to 19%, which is down from our previous outlook of 20% to 22%; net interest expense in the range of $220 million to $230 million, which is down $10 million from our previous expectation; and capital expenditures in the range of $450 million to $500 million, which is up $25 million from our previous forecast; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $420 million.
Consistent with our approach in June 2020, we introduced -- when we introduced our $5 baseline, we were defining our long-term average oilseed crush margin range by using the weighted average of our footprint over the past four years plus the trailing 12 months.
This increases our average soy crush margin by $1 a metric ton to a range of $34 to $36 per metric ton and, more significantly, it increases our average softseed crush margin, which is more sensitive to oil demand, by about $10 a metric ton to a range of $48 to $52 per metric ton.
The approximate 30% increase in Refined and Specialty Oils earnings is driven by a higher capacity utilization in North American refining and increased contribution from specialty oils due to improvement initiatives that are underway.
Net interest expense is reduced by approximately $25 million compared to the $5 baseline, reflecting debt paydown from strong cash flow in 2021 and normalized working capital.
It's important to note that our earnings baseline of $7 is not earnings powered.
At a $7 per share baseline, we should generate approximately $1.4 billion of adjusted funds from operations.
After allocating capital to sustaining capex and preferred and common dividends to shareholders, we should have about $800 million of discretionary cash available annually for reinvestment in the business or returns to shareholders.
This is an increase of approximately $200 million of cash per year from our $5 baseline.
