We are proud of our results as we continue to gain market share and improve our profitability throughout every one of our 15 markets.
During the quarter we sold an all-time quarterly record of 3,109 homes, 49% better than a year ago.
Our absorption pace per community improved significantly to 5.3 sales per community compared to 3.1 sales per community a year ago.
Smart Series sales comprised nearly 35% of total companywide sales during the quarter compared to 30% a year ago and just 16% in 2019.
We are selling our Smart Series product in all 15 of our divisions and in roughly one-third of our communities.

Revenues increased 43% and also represented a first quarter record.

As a result, our pre-tax income was an all-time quarterly record of $110 million, 167% better than a year ago with a pre-tax income percentage of 13.3% compared to 7.2% last year.
These strong returns resulted in a 25% return on equity improving from the 22% full year return on equity we had in 2020.
Specifically, since 2013 our revenues have grown at a compounded annual rate of 19% and our pre-tax income has grown at an even more impressive annual rate of 43%.

We divide our 15 markets into two regions.
New contracts in the Southern region increased 46% during the quarter.
In the Northern region, new contracts increased 53% during the quarter.
Our deliveries increased 34% in the Southern region during the quarter to 1,218 deliveries or 60% of the total.
The Northern region contributed the balance 801 deliveries, an increase of 36% over last year.

Companywide we own approximately 16,800 lots, which is roughly -- slightly less than a two-year supply.
On top of that, we control via option contracts an additional 2500 lots.
So, in total, our owned and controlled lots approximate 42,000 single-family lots, which is just under a five-year supply.
Importantly and worth noting, 60% of those lots of controlled under option contracts, which gives M/I Homes significant flexibility to react to changes in demand or individual or unexpected market conditions.
We had 100 communities in the Southern region at the end of the quarter, which is down from 125 a year ago.
In the Northern region, we had 87 communities at the end of the quarter, which is down 11% from the 98 we had last year at this time.
