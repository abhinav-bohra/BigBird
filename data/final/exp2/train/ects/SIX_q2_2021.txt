Over the past few months, we have hosted numerous vaccination sites at our parks, and we have donated more than 140,000 tickets as an incentive for residents in areas around our parks in Texas, Illinois and California to get vaccinated.
Through July 25, year-to-date attendance and open parks was 82% of 2019 levels.
Excluding prebooked groups, year-to-date attendance at our parks during the periods they were open in 2021 was 89% compared to the same period in 2019.
For the second quarter, our guest spending per capita was up more than 20% versus the second quarter of 2019 due to progress on several of our transformation initiatives as well as a strong consumer spending backdrop.
As a result of our strong revenue trends and season pass sales, we generated $190 million of cash flow during the quarter.
Total attendance for the quarter was 8.5 million guests, a 19% decline from second quarter 2019, reflecting fewer operating days at several of our parks due to the pandemic capacity restrictions at some of the parks that were open and the loss of most of our prebooked group sales.
The net benefit of these shifts into the second quarter of 2021 was 614,000 of attendance and $32 million of revenue.
Through July 25, year-to-date attendance at open parks was 82% of 2019 levels and has accelerated since the end of the quarter.
Excluding prebooked groups, year-to-date attendance at our parks that have been open all year was 89% of 2019 levels.
Attendance from our single-day guests in the second quarter represented 36% of total attendance versus 39% for the second quarter of 2019, reflecting the impact of lower prebook sales, which are counted toward single-day attendance.
We expect this calendar shift -- the calendar change to shift approximately 500,000 of attendance out of the fourth quarter and into the third quarter.
When netted against the shift of the July four weekend out of the third quarter, we expect the changes in our fiscal calendar to negatively impact the third quarter's attendance compared to 2019 by approximately 400,000 guests.
Total guest spending per capita increased 23% in the quarter versus 2019.
Applying the pro forma allocation mentioned on last quarter's earnings call to 2019, admission spending per capita increased 24%.
And in-park spending per capita increased 22% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
Revenue in the quarter was $460 million, down $17 million or 4%.
Excluding the impact of reduced sponsorship, international agreements and accommodations revenue, revenue was down less than $1 million.
On the cost side, cash, operating and SG&A expenses versus 2019 decreased by $4 million or 2%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $170 million, down $9 million or 5% versus second quarter 2019.
Second quarter 2021 also included $11 million of proceeds received in connection with one of our terminated international development agreements in China.
As a reminder, second quarter 2019 included a $7.5 million settlement related to the termination of our international development agreement in Dubai.
At the end of the second quarter, we had 6.3 million pass holders, which included 2.1 million members and 4.2 million traditional season pass holders.
Deferred revenue as of July four, 2021, was $310 million, up $75 million or 32% compared to second quarter 2019.
Year-to-date capital expenditures were $42 million.
For the full year, we previously expected to spend less than $98 million spent in 2020.
However, because of our strong operating results and cash flow and our confidence that our operating performance will continue to improve, we now have capital expenditures of $130 million to $140 million in 2021.
We expect to believe 9% to 10% of revenue is an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures in a normalized environment.
Our liquidity position as of July four was $714 million.
This included $461 million of available revolver capacity net of $20 million of letters of credit and $253 million of cash.
Net cash flow for the quarter was $190 million.
In 2021, we expect to achieve $30 million to $35 million from our fixed cost reductions, and we have already realized more than $16 million through the first half of this year.
We continue to be on track to deliver $80 million to $110 million in incremental annual run rate EBITDA once our transformation plan has been fully implemented and attendance returns to 2019 levels.
This includes an incremental investment of approximately $20 million in seasonal wage rate increases annually on a go-forward basis in addition to the $20 million we called out in our previous baseline for a net increase of $40 million compared to 2019.
As part of our transformation plan, we expect to incur $70 million in charges.
We have incurred $46 million in cost so far through second quarter 2021, including the noncash write-offs of $10 million that occurred in 2020.
We expect to incur the remaining $24 million in 2021 and 2022, the majority of which is related to investments in technology, including a new CRM system.
Priority #2 is to pay down debt until we reach our targeted leverage range of three times to four times net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
To conclude, we are encouraged by the initial progress on our transformation plan and are well positioned to achieve our adjusted EBITDA baseline range of $530 million to $560 million when attendance levels return to 2019 levels including the impact from labor inflation.
And we expect to realize $30 million to $35 million of fixed cost savings in 2021.
As the operating environment returns to 2019 levels, and we implement more of our transformation program, we expect to achieve our adjusted EBITDA baseline range of $530 million to $560 million.
