Our second quarter 2021 earnings per share increased 17.5% compared to the second quarter of 2020.
Included in the results is a $0.03 per share benefit from weather primarily in the Northeast, where we saw a moderate impact from warmer and drier-than-normal conditions.

We've added approximately 11,200 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 86,900 customer connections through pending acquisitions.
We plan to spend $1.9 billion in 2021 and about $10.4 billion over the next five years.

We're also affirming our long-term earnings per share compound annual growth rate range of 7% to 10%.

Results for the regulated operations increased $0.27 per share for the year-to-date period.
We saw a $0.50 per share increase from additional revenue -- additional authorized revenue from acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of '20 attributable to the pandemic.
Year-to-date results also reflect the estimated $0.03 per share favorable weather benefit.
Offsetting these increases were increases in O&M expense of $0.18 per share and depreciation of $0.08 per share, all as a result of growth in the business.
The Market-Based Businesses results decreased $0.05 per share due to higher claims in 2021 in Homeowner Services Group, including the extreme cold weather across the country during the first quarter of '21, primarily in Texas and Illinois.

This means we're close to our goal of a 40% reduction by 2025.
